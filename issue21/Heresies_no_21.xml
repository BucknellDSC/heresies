				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Margaret Randallis a poet who has contributed frequently to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Heresies and to leading literary and political journals. Unaware
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of the consequences she would suffer later, she gave up her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>American citizenship in the 1960s and applied for Mexican
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>citizenship so she could live and work in Mexico while raising her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>children. She spent fifteen years there and lived in Cuba and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Nicaragua as well before returning to the U.S. Throughout her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>writing career she has expressed views on racism, sexism, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>foreign policy that the Reagan administration finds inimical to its
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>policies. A fewyears ago she came back to the United States to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>be with her family and to teach at the University of New Mexico
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in Albuquerque, at which time she tried to reassume her US
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>citizenship. On August 28, 1986, Immigration Judge Martin
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Spiegel ruled that Margaret Randall would not be permitted to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>remain in the U.S. because, in his judgment, her writings &quot;advo
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cate the economic, international, and government doctrines of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>world communism.&quot; This charge is a statutory basis for exclusion
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>under the McCarran-Walter Act, passed in 1952 at the height of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the McCarthy era. Judge Spiegel gave Randall until December 1,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>1986 to leave the country. In February 1987, an appeal of his
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>decision was made to the Board of Immigration, and her case is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>also being brought before a Federal District Court. Joining her as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>plaintiffs in the federal case are the PEN American Center and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>several prominent writers, including Kurt Vonnegut and Alice
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Walker. Margaret Randall is permitted to remain in this country
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>pending the appeal decision, expected some time in April. Funds
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>are urgently needed to fight this case. Donations should be made

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>bonding and celebration take place around food. For
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women, in particular, our relationship to food is a very
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>personal one. At the most fundamental level, human life
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>depends on a woman for its very being. A woman’s body
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>feeds the unborn child. Her breast milk provides the in

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>bodies, the child’s first medicine. An infant’s primary instinct
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>is to survive; its first wail a callinq out for food. Food,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>then, is at the heart of lanquage and the first medium of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>exchange a child discovers.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>As the original providers of food, women are sustainers
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of life and continue that role as cooks, smart shoppers,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>waitresses, health care professionals, social workers, mar
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ket sellers, and small farmers. But since a woman’s individ

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the conditions of her children—has been taken out of her
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>hands, issues related to feeding and nurturing have moved
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>out of the personal, and into the political realm.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>In the beginning, they say, Eve ate that tempting apple
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>And where did it get her? Eve gained knowledge, yes,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>but she would now have to suffer pain in childbirth. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hunger caused humans to become mortal and ashamed, so
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the story goes. But the most important consequence of her
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ravenous appetite is that Eve lost her autonomy —man
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>would rule over woman, and her desires would now be
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>subject to her husband’s.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ourselves. In the last two decades or so,

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>purpose; second, the sociological or structuralist strand, which
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>interprets the prohibitions as actors in a symbolic system or as
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>symbols that demarcate or protect significant social bound
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>aries; and, third, the socio-economic explanations, that believe

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>alytic terms would throw me into examining food taboos on a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>case-by-case basis; Iwould then have to explain how the &quot;uni
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>versal” principles of psychic life had made their mark on a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>cultural practice, had intruded into the social and economic
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>realms and become institutionalized. Food taboos may indeed
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>have a psychic background but seem to operate in the cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>foreground to such an extent that I think they should be dealt

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>To be helpful, an explanation must tell us what functions

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>people and not to others. A materialist like myself wants to

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>my thinking to the functionalist level. Thoughts and symbols
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>are, somehow, “real things&quot; and instrumental in human life.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>because of its variable expression; other domestic animals, in

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>must separate the realities of mortality at birth and

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>bies, and higher maternal mortality. In Southeast Asia
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>women do make a connection; they credit the food
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>avoidances with giving them smaller babies and, thus,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>easier deliveries. But many of the smaller babies die,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and surely the women must also recognize a connec

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>part in ordering the group’s social relations.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>A part of this conceptual scheme is embodied in the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>society’s marriage rules, which make sure that people

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>small-scale societies. In such groups food prohibitions

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>securing or of displaying the interlocking of social groups...
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Levi-Strauss postulates that food taboos occur more often
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>in matrilineal societies, in which the relative power of obliga

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ambiquous. The mother’s kin group needs the reinforcement
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that totemic food taboos can give. A patrilineal system usually
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>endows the father’s kin group with a clearer dominant role
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and greater enforcement power.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>So Levi-Strauss pulls sexism, or at least the sexual division
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of roles and rights, back to an origin in radical sociology—the

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cepts as a given that men use women as exchange, and women
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>do not have any control over men; that men’s control of mar
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>riage exchange is universal; and that the underlying opposi
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tion of women and men is as fundamental, and ancient, as the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>discrimination of animal and human. He posits man as the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>consumer, woman as the consumed, and feels that a meta
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>phoric transformation makes societies pattern food exchange
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>after kinship—that is, female—exchange. (In this argument
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>he takes note of the widespread connection between sex and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>eating.) His assumption puts the subordination of women prior
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to any of its expressions and asserts that the discriminating
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>actions (food taboos, lack of property rights, etc.) are not im
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>plicated in creating the very idea they’re said to be supporting
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>(women’s inferior status). Levi-Strauss does not explain wom

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that by enmeshing people in a web of marriage obligations
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>social groups gain cohesion, but one would not point thereby
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>to the reasons women are exchanged and not men.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Mary Douglas, of a looser sociological school, agrees that

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>wondered how you could help a small farmer by paying him to
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>keep his land fallow. I couldn’t get it out of my head as  passed
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Fred’s field, and then there were others.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The answer wouldn’t come to me until many years later,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>after l’d stopped reading the books I was given in school and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>went into the library myself to seek out my own answers.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>AGRIBIZ. Ilearned that while, on the one hand, small farmers
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>were being paid to keep their land fallow, on the other, huge
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>corporations were being subsidized by our government with
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>our tax dollars. The result was that the land they paid small
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>farmers to keep fallow was lowering production on one end,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>while the subsidies were raising it on the other. All the while,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>prices were rising.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>As I pored over the books, I wondered, almost out loud,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Who are the ones benefiting from that? Monopolies, as in
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tended, grew, and soon small farmers could not compete.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>During my teenage years, farms all over New England were
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>shutting down as they are now out West. Sons went into fac
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tories. Everywhere you went you’d hear people say, &quot;You can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>work ’em. You can’t survive.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>You couldn’t survive as Babci and Dzadzi had. Each day
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>their own, but not. But yes! Babci could decide when to pick
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the eggs, and the eggs were hers. If she needed a particular
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>herb, well, chamomile grew out in the chicken yard and in
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>front of the house And wild thyme, well, that grew in a num
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ber of pastures inabundance. Änd’then there was the garden
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The brown dirt on her hands gave her life.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>can remember running the dark, rich earth through my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>fingers again and again, and over my hands till it came up my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>arms. Iknew what it was. It gave me life. I too, understood my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>part in it, a part l had learned well and of which Iwas proud.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The fact that we could grow food gave us power in relation to
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>our lives—the ability to survive. To kids in town, dirt on you
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>was &quot;dirty, but to me it was brown gold. It was that from
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>which I took life.

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to be. The cool, clear, crisp day
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>became suddenly sunny and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>warm. I remembered myself
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ambling up the hill to the front steps. Tused to smile as passed
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the lilac tree and the cheese hanging in the sun to dry. That joy
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was in my stride as l retraced the steps l’d so often taken.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Sometimes l’d detour to the left, before greeting Babci and

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>house. As I turned the corner, I could see that it was no longer
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>there, nor was the cherry tree that had given us so much plea
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sure, nor the pear trees.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>walked to the back of the house, near the pantry, the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>pantry that once housed a million smells and boxes with lids.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>My sisters and I snuck in there every time Babci was out of the

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>now a &quot;breezeway. Aswalked over the new flagstone patio
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>outside the breezeway, I noticed a farm implement my grand
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>father used to use. It was placed on the corner as it to demar

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>lying there on the patio they never used, I wondered what
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>meaning it could have to them. It was my grandfather’s. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>alive once. It had worked with the energy brought forth by my
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>grandfather’s hands. As I touched it, I tried to touch him. The

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>It was used to rake the fields after the hay had been cut, bound,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>and carted off to the barns. It picked up hay that had been left
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>in the process. Nothing was ever wasted. It was one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>most beautiful of the earlier pieces of machinery. When trac
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>tors and trucks took the place of the horses, it was parked in
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>back of one of the barns, where it stood for years. Today it is a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>lawn ornament, tastefully placed upon a cement base. It is on

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>have cut the lilacs? Who cuts lilacs down? All the apple trees
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>were gone, too. Why would you kill an orchard? There wasn’t

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>recover myself. I remembered when my sister and Iwere jump
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ing from the loft into the hay and the yellow jacket stung
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Kathy while she was in mid-air. I remembered that bizarre plum

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and ate for hours one day. I remembered the bunnies. Babci
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>would pull back the hay and there they’d be—freshly born
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>bunnies l’d tenderly soothe with my human hands.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>But then I remembered the bitterness when I was little and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>how I repeated over and over again: I will not be bitter. Iwill
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>not grow old and bitter. Iwas so freshly alive then l couldn’t

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N011'/>There is nothing I can do at this moment, Ithought, as there

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N019'/>tending his trees, working his land. Can lget my father, who is

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N022'/>But I knew he couldn’t talk for a camera. It is I who will

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N020'/>to be on her land—we are al
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N021'/>lowed to walk the land that we once knew as our own.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N022'/>pointed my camera toward the woods, those deep woods
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N023'/>where, every summer, I still go to pick the blackberries that
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N024'/>grow there. I take my youngest brother, Kris, with me and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N025'/>show him where the largest and most succulent can be found
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N026'/>hiding in the shade beneath the largest trees. We pick until
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N027'/>we’re exhausted. We often walk the hills and valleys the owner
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N028'/>has not seen. We find the few rare blackcaps, which taste
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N029'/>different from blackberries, and the green, translucent berry of
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N030'/>the gooseberry bush. Sometimes we search for the patch with
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N031'/>the largest wild strawberries that we discovered the first time
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N032'/>we went into the woods together, when Kris was only two.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N033'/>Then, l’d walk with him and tell him how many cows Dzadzi
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N034'/>used to have and how he farmed. Iwanted him to know what
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N035'/>could not put from my mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N036'/>As Iwalked back to the road, my feet got wet in the sur
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N037'/>rounding swamp. The pond had become a swamp because
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N038'/>there was no one to drain it and dig out the rich silt, as they
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N039'/>had when the farm was a farm. Then the pond provided tons
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N040'/>of ice which was used to cool the milk in the summer.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N041'/>noticed that my feet were covered with mud. But didn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N042'/>care.felt good.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N043'/>Next to the fence were a few dried-up burdock bushes.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N044'/>We used to run into them now and then. Once we got bur
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N045'/>docks in our clothes, they were hard to get out, and forget it if
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N046'/>we got them in our hair! But the nice thing about them is that
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N047'/>we could make rugs, pocketbooks, baskets, and all kinds of
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N048'/>things—they stuck together so well
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N049'/>It hurt to see Dzadzi’s hay-baler out there rusting in the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N050'/>field. I remembered the sound it made when it was new and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N051'/>out in one of Dzadzi’s huge fields, eveyone working alongside
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N052'/>it. The men wore no shirts and beads of sweat glistened all
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N053'/>over their broad, muscular backs. God, they were beautiful.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N054'/>The wind would blow the chaff up on us where it would stick
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N055'/>to our sweat, itching us to death as we’d heave fifty-pound
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N056'/>bales of newly mown, sweet-smelling hay onto the flatbed
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N057'/>trucks. Iloved it.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N058'/>Then l&apos;d get home and hear Mom say to Dad, &quot;You got
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N059'/>those girls out there hayin’ again? I thought ! told you...
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N060'/>And l’d hear Dad, a little gingerly, yet proud, yell back: &quot;Yup!
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N061'/>Can’t stop em!
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N062'/>Mom would go about muttering how we were “girls&quot; and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N063'/>were going to have babies some day and this could very well
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N064'/>hurt our private parts—lifting and heaving these bales. We&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N065'/>smile and keep out of sight. We were ten, eleven and twelve
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>-we could do anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>started to walk again,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>past the maples my father had
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>planted when he was a boy.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>How straight and tall they
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>stood. And full.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>l&apos;I give these pictures to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Dad, I thought. Dad, who
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>shares these memories with
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>me, secretly, who harbored
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>them for years without saying
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>When I was almost home,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>decided to stroll down to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Fred’s farm. Fred was one of
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the last people in the area
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>trying to farm. No one was
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>about sol walked to the back
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of the barn. l&apos;d known Fred
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>all my life but lfelt funny walk
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing on his land with no one about. God, I thought, l&apos;m still so
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>fresh from the city. When you visit people you have to find
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>them first, so it’s just natural to walk to the barn or up behind
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>them while they’re working. I would have to get used to that
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>again.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>At the back of the barn I found a corral with a herd of
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>thirty young heifers, and Fred’s two young children running
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>among them. &quot;Don’t scare me to death!&quot;Iscreamed.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>’t’sokay, Fred’s daughter said. &quot;We do this all the time.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>l’d forgotten what it was like to run among them. Fred&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>children showed me their favorite cows and told me their names.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>We talked to the cows and petted them. I could see the cows
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>responding and l flushed with a respect l’d known long ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N001'/>When l arrived home, I ran into Dad
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N002'/>in the driveway. I told him about the photographs. He immedi
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N003'/>ately started talking about the trees he’d planted: “Did you
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N004'/>see how big they’ve grown?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N005'/>With my face turned a little to hide the tears, I said, &quot;Yes.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N006'/>Dad. I touched them today. They’ve grown into beautiful trees.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>&quot;Ah, you walked up to the farm today.&quot; He smiled.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>It was not supposed to be called &quot;the farm&quot; anymore. Mom
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N009'/>told me that one day after it had been sold. It was to be called
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N010'/>by the last name of the new owners. But! couldn’t stop. And
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N011'/>knew it warmed Dad. So we spoke quietly, barely above a
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N012'/>whisper. It would always be the farm for us.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N013'/>When I got into the house, l plopped into a chair in the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N014'/>living room. I was looking forward to the light, cool evening
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N015'/>one finds in the summer in the mountains.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>needed to rest and be alone, but my mother came into
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N017'/>the room.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N018'/>There’s something l know you’l want to know.&quot; She said
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N019'/>it so quietly I became apprehensive. I could see the barren
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N020'/>fields outside the window outline her body as she leaned to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N021'/>ward me to speak. &quot;Fred lost the farm.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N022'/>’No.&quot; The same numb feeling I had felt that morning crept
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N023'/>into me. &quot;But,&quot; l began, I was just down there. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N024'/>milking.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N025'/>The bank and the milk company pulled a fast one on him.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N026'/>The milk company withheld payment on this last shipment so
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N027'/>the bank foreclosed.&quot;
			</p>
			<pb n='24'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>What do you mean? How could they do that?” l responded
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with anger, as if somehow my anger could change what was
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>being told. &quot;Can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>’No,&quot; she said. &quot;They were in it together. They set it up.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>looked at this strong, invincible woman—Mom. I won
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>dered if I would ever be like her. Yet there she stood, helpless
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>in the middle of her living room. She was looking to me for
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>strength. But l was angry. &quot;This was legal?” lasked.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>&quot;No.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;Then how could they...
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>&quot;They just did. There was nothinq he could do. It’s compli
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cated. They’ve been trying to do it for years. It was just a mat
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ter of time, she said.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_l' n='N014'/>&quot;But the cows...,&quot; I protested. I still did not want to be
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>lieve her.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>Those are the last few of his cows. He was supposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>get rid of them last week. They gave him a week to get off the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>land.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>I could see her sadness now. She hadn’t moved as she
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>spoke. Mom always moved when she talked. This was serious.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>realized we now shared the same love for the land I had
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>known as a child.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>’Who bought the land?&quot; I asked, pacing in front of her.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;The government.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;What are they going to do with it?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>It’s going to become a federal preserve. Forever. No one
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>can touch it.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>&quot;So,&quot; I said, finally, &quot;it’s just going to be there doing noth
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing. Here’s a farmer who wants to farm. He gets thrown off
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>his land. And the government buys it to just let it sit there and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>do nothing. Where’s he going to go?
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&apos;Nowhere. He won’t leave. It was so sad,&quot; she said, look-
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing at me intently. &quot;I went down there the day they took the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>cows away. The Father came.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>smiled. I could just see this Roman Catholic priest stand
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ing in the middle of the road in his elegant, black tunic as they
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>loaded most of Fred’s cows onto trucks to be taken away.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>’Everyone was crying,” she continued. “There was noth
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ing we could do.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>’It’s good you were there,&quot; l said, looking into her eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>felt her hurt.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>wanted him to know I cared,&quot; she said.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>How can they take a man’s life away from him like that?
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>s he okay.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>People are worried. That’s why Father came.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>By stoying, fed is consdered a be
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>of a fool by the townspeople, some-
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>one who will not accept reality. The townspeople don’t see
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>agribiz. It’s not reported in the newspapers or, if it is, you have
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>to read between the lines. They see things more simply—they
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>see that a man has failed, rather than a system. This is how
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>they see all the farmers who lose their farms, except for the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>ones who hung themselves in their barns.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>It wasn&apos;t until the second day of my visit this summer that
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>saw my brother, Kris—Kris at sixteen. He came running into
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>the house, threw off his Friendly lce Cream Parlor uniform,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>and pulled on his jeans and boots. Once again, l saw the broad,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>tanned, muscular back that one gets from laboring in the coun
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>try sun. I grabbed him and kissed him.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>Hi. What a chest! Where are you going in such a hurry?
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>said.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>&quot;To help Fred hay.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>But Fred doesn’t own his farm anymore. What’s he doinq
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>haying?
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>Kris looked at me with a smooth agitation, like it didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>matter what Ithought, like he had heard this before and would
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>kindly disregard it.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>He loves it. Look, if he calls, tell him l’m on my way.&quot; And
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>he was out the door.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>thought about the conversation l’d had with Mom about
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>Kris when he was fourteen. We had talked many times about
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>my &quot;littlest brother”— how he was doing in school, the prob
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>lems he faced, and what course he would take with his life.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>We were concerned. What would he do? There are not many

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>The major barrier for the Queen, for
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the chiefesses, and for women of the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lower classes as well, is the kapu system
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>—the ancient religious tabus that requ

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>from canoeing to fishing, from dancing
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to eating. The aristocratic alii and the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>kahunas, or priests, who exercise domi
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>nant power on the islands, base their

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>religion.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>To Kaahumanu, the worst aspect of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the kapu system is its underlying belief
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>that women of all classes are inferior,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>less pleasing to the gods than mens
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>While many activities are kapu, or forbid

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>for women. Women are for example
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>strictly bared from the luakiniheiaus, the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>temples where the major political and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>religious decisions are made—a kapu
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>which inhibits Kaahumanu&apos;s power as
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Kuhina Nui.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>But even more humiliating for women
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>are the eating kapus. Women of all
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>classes are forbidden to eat some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>most delicious foods: those plentiful
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>yellow bananas, the sweet coconuts,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>pork, shark, sea turtle, whale, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>delicacy of baked dog. One bite of such
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>foods, say the kahunas, will infuriate the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>gods, causing illness, tidal waves, vol
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>canic eruptions. Moreover, say the priests,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>food for women and men must be cooked
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>by men only, in separate ovens, and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>eaten at sex-segregated tables.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The penalty for breaking any kapu is
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>severe. The priests cruelly enforce the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>laws, especially against lower-class wom
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>en and men, capturing the law breakers,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>burning them, strangling them, plucking
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>out their eyes.

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>coup, Kaahumanu takes her favorite
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>surfboard far out into the ocean, to find
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>inspiration for overthrowing the onerous
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>food tabus. She knows it is not the gods
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>she must fear, for surely they would
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>have punished the people by now. For

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and even some shark without so much

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>That’s why I am trying to tell you this story. So you won’t think l just have no self-control. JI am falling
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>through the space of my own body, through the empty space where there ought to be a person. Shrunken
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>half my former size and half again less without my sister, I can’t even find the me that is left. I must be here
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>someplace on this bed with all these Hostess Twinkies. JIn the past four days I have devoured eight
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>buckets of chicken, four buckets of ribs, a whole brisket from the delicatessen, eight loaves of rye bread,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>five pounds of no-salt butter, six gallons of milk, six quarts of Carvel, and the contents of three vending
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>machines. Never mind what was in them, I don’t think I even noticed. JAnd where is Michelle, my
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>other half, my sister? Where is she now, when I need her more than ever? I who beat up Harriet
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>Reinstein in the third grade for pulling her beautiful braids? I who bore the brunt with her of every fat joke
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>known to man and cruel child? I who endured with her the dreariness of the Chubby Shop and the Lane
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>Bryant catalog? Jl’II tell you where Michelle is. She’s on her honeymoon, with Tony, our agent, that two-timing
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>fairweather friend. On her honeymoon in Bermuda, while I poor doubly-jilted monster, eat myself into oblivion in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>Easton, South Carolina. J Formerly we were go-go dancers, Michelle and I A profession so grueling we should have
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>been awarded Olympic medals every time we finished our act. We met Tony the night we were working the Pilgrim
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>Theatre in Boston, as a warm-up act for Fanne Fox. It was also the night that Wilbur Mills showed up onstage, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>photos of us being hugged by him in the papers the next morning would have clinched our career for sure. But that night
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>we took up with Tony, and we left burlesque forever. JI kept noticing Tony in the audience. Night after night he sat in the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>first row and ate Hershey’s Kisses. He unwrapped each one and put it in his mouth. Then he rolled the silver into a ball with the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>paper tag on the inside and put it in the pocket of his shirt. What did he do with all those little balls? I also noticed he was
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>handsome and sexy and, while we were dancing, l’d watch him and taste the chocolate with that pointy little nub poking the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>roof of my mouth. l’d smile at him and aim a few bumps in his direction. It seemed to me he smiled back, a special appreciatior
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>of my art. J Later, when we left the theatre that last night, he was standing outside on Washington Street. Iwould have
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N055'/>recognized him anywhere, with that white-toothed smile, those soft brown eyes, that pocket full of little silver balls. 3 &quot;Hey,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N056'/>he said, &quot;How ya doin?”. J Michelle turned her back. Ismiled at him. J &quot;Name’s Anthony Positano. l’ve been catching your
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N057'/>act all week. Fabulous. I think you’re terrific.&quot;, J &quot;Ignore him, Barbara,” said Michelle. &quot;Stop smiling.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N058'/>J&quot;Hey, gimme a

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N062'/>the one he had stretched out. He put his other one over hers like it was a sandwich. J&quot;It’s a pleasure to meet you. Like

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Yeah. You know, like T.V., radio commercials, magazine
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>layouts. This buddy of mine just shot that Alpo commercial,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>you know, where the dogs are doing the hustle at Studio 547
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>And he’s looking for some talent for his next job.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>No, no, of course not. This one is Alka-Seltzer. You’d be
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>perfect.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>&quot;Yeah, well, O.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>said Michelle. &quot;It was nice meeting you.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>We really have to get home now. Give Steve a call if somethng

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>She shot out her arm for a taxi, and one screeched to a

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>When we were sitting in the cab, llooked back at him and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>realized why l liked his smile so much. He didn’t look at us like

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Stupid son-of-a-bitch,&quot; said Michelle. &quot;Alpo commercials.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>What does Legari think he’s doing sending this creep down
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>here?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>&quot;l thought he was nice,&quot;I said. &quot;What are you going to tell
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Steve to say when he calls him?
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Don’t worry, Barbara, he won’t call.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Michelle is very smart, but she’s no fortune teller. We’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>been eating off the royalties on &quot;Oy, have we got a stomach
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ache” for two and one half years now.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Two hundred pounds became three hundred in the bright
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>lights of the studio and the dim ones of Elaine’s, where we
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>went every night for dinner. Without our dancing to keep our
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>weight down, Michelle and I blew up like balloons. But if we
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>were popular at two hundred, our accounts loved us at three.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>By the time our lavish bodies appeared in a zipper ad in the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>New York Times Magazine Section (backs of our dresses un

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>—Next time they’ll use Zippy Zippers&quot;), we weighed three hun
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>dred fifty pounds apiece. And our Zippy account loved every
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>pound.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>But then we went beyond the numbers on the scale, and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Michelle’s varicose veins got so bad she could hardly stand on
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>her feet for ten minutes. Tony got worried and sent us down
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>here to Dr. Steinhopf.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>First they put us in the hospital and stuck our arms with
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>needles all day long. Liver function tests, kidney function tests,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>fasting blood sugars, pissing blood sugars, x-rays, gamma rays
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>You name it, they did it to us. The hospital floor was paintec
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>with yellow footprints to show us how to get from one test to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>another. At the end of the two days of testing Dr. Steinhopf
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>told us we would now take the most important test of all, the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Doorway test. If we got through it, we could live at the Holida
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Inn and go about exercising on our own, reporting to Dr.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Steinhopf only in the morning to deliver our urine specimens
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>and be weighed.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>But if we failed, we would be put into the hospital for
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>twenty-four-hour observation and total fasting until we could
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>pass the test.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>We failed. We could only make it through the Dining Room
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>doorway by turning sideways and holding our breath, and that
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>was considered cheating.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>They put us in hospital johnnies in adjoining rooms and fed
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>us intravenous fluids for three days. We tried to call to each
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>other through the wall and to sneak into each other’s rooms,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>but with the problems of holding the hospital johnnies to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>gether and the clanking of the l.V. bottles, we couldn’t be
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>unobtrusive. The nurses and orderlies always caught us and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>led us back to bed.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>pictured Michelle in the next room, tied like me into three
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>regulation nightgowns and hallucinating food. Pizza and choc
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>olate cake danced on my ceiling, and the television seemed to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>say, &quot;Chow-time!&quot; every time I pushed the remote control.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>dreamed my bed was a bathtub full of chicken and woke up
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to find my teeth sunk into my arm. 1was nauseous, frightened,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>hungry, panicked. The only thing that kept me from banging
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>my head on the wall was the thought of Michelle next door,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>like a reflection in the mirror that went all the way inside.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>looked at my hand and saw her hand. Tlooked at my leg and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>saw hers. Inside I felt hollow, and I knew that she did too. It
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was like the Lincoln Tunnel from my room to hers.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Then they took out the intravenous tubes and told us we
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>could walk around the corridor. I ran into Michelle’s room, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was empty. They’d removed her l.V. an hour before. Iwas wor
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ried. Maybe she went crazy and escaped as soon as they un
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>hooked her. Why else would she have stayed away from me?
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>But two minutes later I found her down the hall, playing
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cards with another patient. They called him The Howling Wolf
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>on account of the noises he made when he was eating. Mi
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>chelle told me later that Dr. Steinhopf had put him back in the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hospital after the Wolf had ordered eight dozen Dunkin Donuts
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>for a church bazaar and eaten them all himself on the ten
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>minute drive to the church.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Barbara, she said to me, &quot;Wasn’t that wild? What was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in those bottles, anyway? Ikept feeling like I was high or some
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>thing. Man, you should have seen all that stuff l kept dream

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>I said, &quot;Like pizzas and cake and everything, right?
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>It’s the fasting that does it.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>’No, I mean the other stuff. I saw myself melting. Like all
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>my fat melting off me and making a big puddle of butter on
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the floor. And when it was all melted, I was gorgeous. 1had
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>this gold bikini on, and there were all these palm trees around
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>me. It was terrific. You should have seen it.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>All of a sudden Iwanted to cry. Why was it different for

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Oh yeah, I said, &quot;Those things. Yeah, 1remember
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that. My bikini was silver. But l’m glad that’s over. What do
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>they give us for dinner?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>The Wolf laughed, I think. But it sounded more like a low
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>shriek with a wheeze at the end. His mouth was a tiny O in a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>mountain of cheeks and chin.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>hate to be the bearer of bad news, said Michelle,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>’but they don’t feed us anything while we’re still in the hos

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>didn’t believe her. How could she say that so blithely and

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>pass frontally through the portals of the Dining Room. There
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we found one hundred and thirty fellow sufferers, each weigh
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing in excess of two hundred pounds. Yes, ladies and gentle
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>men, the Dining Room, as we entered it for the first time,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>contained upwards of thirty thousand pounds of human flesh.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>They were all eating rice.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>We were allowed one cup of rice for lunch and one cup of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>rice for supper, accompanied each time by two limp fruits. For
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>breakfast there was a half grapefruit, but we were encour
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>aged not to eat it.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>After breakfast everyone put on shorts and walked the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>three-mile wall that encircles the hospital and university cam
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>pus. The Easton shopkeepers specialize in what they call &quot;half
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sizes. Michele and I for example, went out and bought our
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>selves size 46½ Bermuda shorts and walked around the wall
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>three times. Just as lwas ready to plunk myself down in the grass,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Michelle grabbed hold of my hand and jerked me to my feet
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>&quot;You re not quitting now, are you?
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Michelle, have a heart. l’m ready to pass out. Come on,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>take a break and sit down with me.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>&quot;Not me, Barbara. l’m not a quitter. l’II pick you up next
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>time around.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>But by her next time around I was half a mile away at Jer

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>pistachios in the window. l’d heard of this place from other pa

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tients, the ones who are labelled “cheaters,&quot; but no one had
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ever told me where it was. Thave a nose for these things. How
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>could Iknow l’d bump into it on my short cut to the Holiday Inn?
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>got back to my motel room an hour later with two half
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>bound bags of Indian nuts stuffed in the cups of my bra. Mi
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>chelle was already swimming laps in the pool. Surrounding her
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>were twenty or thirty other women of the obese persuasion,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sunning themselves happily, in size 42½ pastel bikinis. Travel

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>at the landscape. It was hard not to! Even I in the modesty of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my Bermuda shorts and Indian nuts, couldn’t take my eyes off
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the group around the pool.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Life went on without food. After a year, Michelle had lost
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>two hundred pounds. I lagged behind at one hundred forty off
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and one hundred forty still to go. Michelle had bought herself
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a whole new wardrobe, and l could hear her dressing and un
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dressing late at night while llay in bed pretending to sleep.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;Mmmm, you re so gorgeous, she whispered to herself.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>She closed her eyes and kissed her reflection in the mirror.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>’Oh, Michelle,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Darling, my darling.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Later on her bed would rock until her breaths came sharp
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and her sighs were high-pitched screeches.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>In November they put me back on intravenous fluids. l&apos;o
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>reached a plateau and stayed there for a month. How could!
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>eat less? How could I exercise more? Already I was walking
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>fourteen miles a day, swimming sixty laps and doing calisthenics.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>panicked and ate a two-pound bag of salted peanuts.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>checked into the Dining Room the next morning weighing ten

			<pb n='33'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>pounds more. Dr. Steinhopf had me admitted to the hospital
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>until llost fifteen pounds.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Ziss can be ze only vay,&quot; he said.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>It was Thanksgiving, and the aroma of food came wafting
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>up the air ducts from the hospital kitchen. At one o’clock a.m.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ripped the I.V. tube out of my hand and ran down the back
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>stairs to the pantry. There, unquarded, were dozens of steam
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>inq turkeys, fresh from the oven. Igrabbed one and, shoving it
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>under my hospital gown, ran back upstairs and into my room,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>where l locked the door and sat up eating until dawn. When
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>finished picking at the carcass, I flushed it down the toilet.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>They never would have found me out if only the plumbing had
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>worked. I might even have explained the burn on my stomach
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>from carrying the turkey under my gown.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Michelle was furious.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>You’re ruining our career,&quot; she said. &quot;Even if you don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>give a shit for yourself, you could at least have the decency to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>think of me. l’m working my ass off to get us somewhere, and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>you’re shtupping turkeys! Jesus!
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Please, Michelle, please try to understand. It was just a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>lapse. Temporary insanity. l’m already back on the straight and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>narrow.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>A lapsel l’m sorry. I can’t forgive a premeditated lapse
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that goes on for three hours. That’s not a lapse, that’s an orgy
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Michelle, I can’t stand it. Please don’t hate me. I can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stand to have you look at me like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>7m mad, Barbara, l’m real mad. But not half as mad as
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>lony will be. He’s depending on us for a June deadline.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Oh, no, you won’t tell Tony. Please, Michelle. Anything
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>l’II do anything. Just don’t tell Tony and make him hate me.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>And that is how I came to promise I would eat only one
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>meal a day. Lunchtime became a brief interlude of peace in an
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ongoing battle to keep myself at the edge of starvation.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>For one hundred and fifty-two days, I Barbara LaGrande
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Weinstock, ate one vegetable a day. That’s it. And once a week
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>it was an onion
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The torment was constant. Waves of hunger rushed against
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>me, swallowed me. I was drowning in hunger. Ihallucinated
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>food everywhere. The clouds looked like loaves of bread or
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>marshmallows. The sun looked like a pizza. My sexual appetite
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>became uncontrollable. llusted after bell-boys and bartenders.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wanted to kiss them all over, suck all their toes and fingers.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>’Empty, empty, empty, banged in my head all day long.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Tony came to see us several times, and each time he seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a little friskier, if you know what I mean. Michelle said flat out
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>she wasn’t interested in him, so that left me where Iwanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>be: in Tony’s arms, at least in my imagination. If romance hadn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>blossomed in two and a half years, at least it seemed to be
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>budding with my loss of weight.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In April Tony came to see us for the first time since my little
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>rampage.I went out and bought a new skirt, with buttons up
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the front that ! could discreetly unbutton at will, and a rasp
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>berry cashmere sweater ! could slip out of with alarming ease.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Michelle agreed to move out of our room for the weekend
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>in case anything should develop, but when she showed up at
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the airport in a revealing black jumpsuit, I wondered if she&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>changed her mind. Tony looked at me with appreciation, but
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>his eyes kept returning to Michelle’s shocking new curves.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>That nightl brought Tony to our room to show him a maq
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>azine article l’d clipped, but once we got there I told him how
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tired he looked. I offered to give him a back rub, which I am
			</p>
			<pb n='34'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>very good at. l also unbuttoned my skirt a little. Soon we were
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>kissing and hugging and doing all the things lhoped we&apos;d do.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>My sweater and skirt came off as easily as l’d planned, but
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>when l got up to lock the door, Tony’s mouth dropped open.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>realized he was staring at my stomach.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Too late! How could l explain a burn the size and shape of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>a roasted turkey? I reached for my sweater, but Tony caught
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>my arm.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>What is that thing, Barbara?
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;That? A birthmark—you never noticed?
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>’No, never. And l’ve seen you in some pretty skimpy get
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ups. Why are some parts of it redder than others? It looks
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>more like a burn to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>No, Tony, a birthmark...
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Barbara, why does it remind me of a turkey in profile?
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>&quot;A birthmark, Tony. One of life’s cruel jokes.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>He was buttoning up his shirt and putting his shoes back
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>on. I tried to stop him, but he closed the door and walked past
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the pool to the public phones.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>When he came back, he was calm, his face dead white.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>All right, Barbara, I know what went on in the hospital.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>just talked to Steinhopf. It happened months ago and it’s over.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>What’s happening now? Huh? How are you cheating me now?
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>He pulled everything off the shelves and out of the closet.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>He dumped the drawers and emptied every suitcase. Then he
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>unscrewed every unscrewable thing in the room until he found
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>my Nestle’s Crunch bar in the air-conditioner and my extra
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>stash of Indian nuts in the used razor bin.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>’All right, baby. Now we’re talking! What else do you have
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>stashed away? C’mon, you little sneak, fork it over. Now!
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>He grabbed my long hair so hard some red strands came
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>out in his fists.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Tony,&quot; Iwhined. &quot;Tm sorry. I hardly ever cheat. There’s

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Tone, please......
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Shut up, Barbara. You make me sick. Don’t tell me how
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>hard you’re trying. Just show me results.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>He slammed the door, and l didn’t see him again until May.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>never tried so hard to do anything in my life, and I did man
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>age to lose twenty pounds, but Tony had lost faith in me. He
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>hardly even noticed. He came down again in June for some
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>business meetings with Michelle, and then she flew to New
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>York for a weekend to sign our new contracts. When she came
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>back, she told me that she and Tony were married.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Married?” I said. &quot;How could you be married? We’ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>living in the same room all this time, and you never said a word
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>We’re big girls now, Barbara. I don’t tell you everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>And to tell you the truth, this happened so suddenly, I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>have time to discuss it with you. We fell in love two weeks ago
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>when he was down here, and this weekend we decided to get
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>married while I was in New York.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>But what about I said. &quot;Tm the one who&apos;s loved
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Tony all along.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>That’s no kind of love, if you ask me. You better grow up,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Barbara. You can’t expect someone to love you when you let
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>them down all the time. Love is built on trust and respect.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Tony doesn’t respect me?&quot;
			</p>
			<pb n='35'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Respect you? He can’t even look you in the eye.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>didn’t know what to say. Michelle’s hot pink shirt was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>burning my eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>How could you leave me,&quot; I wailed.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Face it, Barbara. you can’t suck up to me all your life.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>You’re gonna have to start making it on your own.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>looked at her, and then llooked in the mirror. Everything
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was getting pretty confusing. One of us had just married Ton
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and, since I was in love with him and Michelle wasn’t, it must
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>have been me. But I didn’t remember any wedding. And Mi
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>chelle was wearing this platinum band on her left hand with
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>all these twinkly little diamonds in it.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>My head felt like a rubber band getting twisted over and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>over. Then my hands and feet took off and floated up to the
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ceiling. I saw Michelle’s head fly off and join them, and then
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>started to laugh.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>&quot;Are you okay Barbara?” said Michelle.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Her face looked so funny up there on the ceiling, asking
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>me if I was O.K. that I started laughing even harder. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>really one of the funniest things l ever saw.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>&quot;Barbara, stop laughing. Calm down. Do you want some
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>water?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>By this time I was choking, 1was laughing so hard.I could
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>hardly breathe. And her face up there on the ceiling was doing
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a little dance with my hands and feet. It was hilarious how her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>face got more and more serious the more her head danced
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>around. Finally l got so exhausted with all this activity, Iwent to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sleep right on the floor. It seemed like I dreamed that Michelle
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was calling up the Howling Wolf on the telephone, but when!
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>woke up they were pushing me into his red convertible and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>speeding down the road.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Nice night for a drive, isn’t it?” 1said, &quot;We should do this
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>more often. Maybe Tony and I could double with you and The
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Wolf, or you and Tony and me and The Wolf. Or all of us
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>together.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>suggested we all sing &quot;We all Live In A Yellow Subma
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>rine, but l got so tired after one chorus I fell asleep again.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>When I woke up, we were at the entrance to the emer
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gency room of the hospital. They gave me a big weird shot of
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>something that made me feel like I was falling, falling, very
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>slowy
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&quot;She’ll calm down and sleep through the night,&quot; the doc
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tor said. “Then she’ll be logy for a couple days. If she gets
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>depressed, give her these pills, one every four hours.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>He was right. My hands and feet came wobbling back to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>their places, and I was too sleepy to walk to the car. They
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>wheeled me out in a wheelchair, and, when Iwoke up, it was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the next afternoon.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>There was a party the next week for Michelle and Tony at
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the Holiday Inn, and I danced with Tony to show there were
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>no hard feelings. He squeezed my hand and told me how pretty
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>looked. I was down to a hundred and sixty pounds and Mi
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>chelle by now looked emaciated.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The next day they took off for two weeks of commercials
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and then on to Bermuda for their honeymoon.

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Before they left, Michelle shot some commercials for Diet

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>thought it up two years ago and kept it to himself until it

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>What happened to sizes recently? I go
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>into a department store and the clothes are
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>size 3. Someone’s whole body could fit into
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>one of my pants legs. I see size 5, size 7 and that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>it. And then a whole rack of something called size
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I SIZE ONE. Did they just change what they call the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sizes—or have women really gotten to be this lit
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tle? This is way past petite. For an 11 (the size every

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>department entirely where the Big Girls go to try on

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>thighs! Wasn’t it just a minute ago that we were all

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>7&quot; smaller than 31&quot;. That is a hell of a lot smaller. Did
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>everyone really lose that much weight? How? Even Scar

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to a 17&quot; waist—which, by the way, is 14&quot; smaller than
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>my 31&quot;when l’mthin!
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Maybe my 31&quot; isn’t really at the waist. It’s below the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>waist. Let’s say that makes it 29&quot;. So someone who mea-
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sures 24&quot; actually at the waist still has a waist that is 5&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>smaller than mine. Five inches is a lot. It&apos;s the differ
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ence between being flat-chested (32’) and having big
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>boobs (37&quot;). What does all this mean? And what can

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the ideal size for women? A 10 was

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ered the real size. I remember reading that
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Grace Kelly wore a 12. And Grace Kelly was not
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>exactly a fat person. But she was a grown-up, a full
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sized woman, an adult. She did not go around wear
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ing a size 3 or a1—even when she became a princess!
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Now, when I was in the 8th grade, I had a 23&quot; waist.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>That was considered petite, a good figure—for an
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>8th grader! I tell you they must have just changed
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the sizes on us. That’s all. Probably some kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>European sizing thing —like the metric system. That
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>must be it. Because it is not possible that women
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>have been called upon to diminish their size to that
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>degree—and to have done it with such a high rate
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of success.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>And what do they do with their thighs? That&apos;s my
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>biggest question. The waist thing ! can live with. After
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>all, I did once actually have a 23&quot; waist myself. And
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>probably even smaller. When I was nine or seven
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>years old—l didn’t even think to measure my waist
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>then. But what about their thighs? How do they
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>dance on those legs? They do dance. I know that.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>mean every size I woman dressed in designer jeans
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>is dancing her head off at a dlub all night long. Right?
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>God. Two of those women could sit comfortably on
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>each of my thighs. That means four of these little
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>women could sit on my lap at the same time and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>probably not even touch each other—probably not
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>even notice each other! There l&apos;d be—out at a hot

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N038'/>that women have benefitted from the industrialization of food.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N039'/>Presumably, we have been enabled to go out, get jobs, and do

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N042'/>met our needs. We believe we have &quot;convenience foods&quot; be

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N044'/>reers and other pleasures. To object to such foods, therefore,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N045'/>seems equivalent to condemning women to kitchen drudgery
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N046'/>Is this really the case? I myself have always doubted that
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N047'/>changes in the food supply were designed to liberate women
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N048'/>am old enough to remember World War II when many women
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N049'/>went out and got jobs—difficult, demanding jobs with long
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N050'/>hours—without the benefit of having convenience foods. And
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N051'/>then, after the war, when women were told to go back and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N052'/>put on aprons so the homecoming soldier boys would have
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N053'/>jobs, suddenly we got a great upsurge in foods designed to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N054'/>save time. The chronology simply didn’t support the notion
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N055'/>that convenience foods helped women get out of the house
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N056'/>My own explanation for produce proliferation—from 800
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N057'/>products in 1928 to 15,000 or more today—is that it arises
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N058'/>from a food industry growth problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N059'/>In the sort of economics by which we are used to measur

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N061'/>must continue to grow or they die. In a society that values
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N062'/>consumption as an expression of personality and a reflection
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N063'/>of success, people can always be sold on wanting new and
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>different things, or the same things in greater numbers. And
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>most commodities can be acquired well beyond need—you
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>can have three houses, five cars, eight navy blue jackets or
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>3000 pairs of shoes. But food is an exception. There is a bio
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>logical limit on food consumption. Even if people are willing to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>become overweight so they can continue to eat, there are quite
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>narrow limits beyond which humans cannot go in consuming
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>food.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>So if population growth levels off, as it pretty much has in
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>this country, the food industry cannot continue to grow by
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>selling the same amount of food to more people, because
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>there aren’t that many more people to sell to. They must sell
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the same number of people more food, or they must make the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>same amount of food cost more. So overconsumption is pro
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>moted (&quot;You can’t eat only one ...&quot;), as are non-caloric foods
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that allow us to consume far beyond need and yet avoid being
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as fat as our overindulgence would normally imply. And, with
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a dazzling display of inventiveness, food marketers have also
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>made use of novelty and overprocessing to induce us to bur

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Thus, at a price (which to a two-wage-earner household is
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>acceptable), the food industry has taken over many functions
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>previously handled by the housewife, has facilitated her de

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>psychological needs. While in some areas the industry may

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>transformation was almost compulsively demanded, the fairer
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>question is to ask, what would have been the effect upon

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>From a nutritional point of view, we can be happy that in

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>McKenzie, in short, says that women insisted on getting out of

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that the technological imperative produced &quot;convenience foods
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and drove women out of the house. Clearly someone was

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Of the many questions that seemed worth asking, one

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>What l believe all this indicates is that the food industry has
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>grown, as it will continue to grow, driven by a technological
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>impetus which is, in turn, driven by a need for continued growth.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Growth is achieved by creating food innovations that house
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>wives and other working women must be convinced they need
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>This means that we as women must decide whether we want

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>that they have been made for our benefit and will ultimately
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>save us time.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The beliefs about women and food that advertisers were
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>selling twenty, thirty and forty years ago were not true; yet we
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>came to believe they were true and, in the process, we helped
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>disempower ourselves. The messages about how we would be
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>freed from kitchen slavery succeeded in making us slaves to
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the manufacturers on whom we are now entirely dependent,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>since many of us have lost—or never acquired—the skills needed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>to convert raw food materials into consumables. It is no laugh

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>should, at a minimum, reexamine the myths that blind us. Food

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Worldwide this patriarchal custom is found. In Asia, some

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>do not eat chicken, goat, partridge, or other game birds. The

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>men and women in the same family was the amount of meat
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>consumed. In one rural county of England, the investigators

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>are not so blatantly expressed. For this reason, the diets of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>English upper-class women and men are much more similar
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>than the diets of upper-class women and working-class women.

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>It has traditionally been felt that the working man needs
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>meat for strength. A superstition analogous to homeopathic
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>principles operates in this belief: in eating the muscle of strong
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>animals, we will become strong. According to the mythology
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of patriarchal culture, meat promotes strength; the attributes
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of masculinity are achieved through eating these masculine
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>foods. Visions of meat-eating football players, wrestlers, and

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>myth remain: men are strong, men need to be strong, thus
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>men need meat. The literal evocation of male power is found
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in the concept of meat.

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women as meat is with men, recalling on a subconscious level
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the days of Woman the Gatherer. Since women have been

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>are considered to be second-class protein. Just as it is thought
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a woman can’t make it on her own, so we think that vegeta
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>bles can’t make a meal on their own, despite the fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>meat is only second-hand vegetables, and vegetables provide,

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>meat. Meat is upheld as a powerful, irreplaceable item of food.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The message is clear: the vassal vegetable should content itself

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>This project, of several distinct components, focuses around a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>powerful central object—a sculpture entitled Pound of Fesh.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The Pound of Fesh Project includes the fabrication of the sculp

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The sculpture itself is a ten-foot-high skeletal structure of
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>welded meat hooks, resembling a Duchampian readymade
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>This structure forms the &quot;bones” of the human figure. Slabs of

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of Arcimboldo’s painting of a butcher made of meat.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The fleshed-out sculpture will be encased in a 12&apos;x4&apos; trans

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Pound of Flesh will be exhibited in a gallery for one month.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>It will then be transported to Area, a club in Lower Manhattan,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>where an art event will culminate in the butchering, cooking,

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>where to go for lunch, she did so out of the desire
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to extend her newly discovered moments of pleasure.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Yet before she realized what had happened, Foss
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was wondering whether she wanted to be seen in
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>public eating wtih another fat woman, especially

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>one who dressed as though she were proud to show
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>off her fat body. Floss didn’t stop to analyze why
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that made her uneasy and, with her next thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>plunged into a deep and well-worn channel.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Floss wondred whether they could take their
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lunch and sit in the sun; some place where they
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>would not be surrounded by people counting the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>calories in every bite they put into their mouths. She
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>speculated over what foods it would feel safe to or
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>der and how much it would feel safe to eat. She knew
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>that, even though she might end up eating less than
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>any of the thin women around, everyone present
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>would swear that these two fat women consumed
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>twice as much as anyone else in the restaurant.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>But what Foss didn’t know and what gave her
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>great anxiety, was whether in fact Bert might eat
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ravenously, thus justifying all the criticism and com
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ments Floss feared. What if Bert sat at the table
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>with her flesh hanging out for everyone to see and
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>had the audacity to enjoy herself as she ate?
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>It was too much to consider. Floss spun into a
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>panic. What could she do? Accepting a common
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>belief that fat women do not deserve to enjoy their
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>food, Floss had learned a habit of ordering smal
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>meals in public and eating quickly to get the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>meal over with as painlessly as possible. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>she did love good food, it had been years since she
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>had known the pleasure of eating her fill in a res
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>taurant, or any public place. She went out to eat
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with her friends because she enjoyed the social con
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tact, not the meals.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>It was one thing to sit in a meeting with other
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fat women and talk about all the changes she wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to see in the acceptance of fat women’s rights, and
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>quite another matter entirely to start behaving in
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>public as though she already believed that she de
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>served these rights.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>As Floss turned this problem over in her mind, it
			</p>
			<pb n='70'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>was an easy jump to the question of whether Floss was in fact
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ready to start eating anything she wanted. She wasn’t sure
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that she deserved to have any food at all. Even though at the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>group meeting she had said she wasn’t going to diet any more,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>did this mean that she was going to stay this fat for the rest of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her life?
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>When she dieted, Floss could hold the illustion that at some
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>future time she would be thin. Even though she knew that her
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>dieting had never been successful for more than a few months
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>at a time, as long as she was dieting she felt herself to be
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>acceptable. She could show the world a diet plate and tell
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>people about her latest efforts.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>While Floss was dieting, she never had to confront the fat
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>woman who lived in her body, the woman with the great pas
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sions, the women of large ideas. As long as she dieted, she
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>could pretend to be a thin woman, an acceptable woman who
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>measured her life out in small portions. Her fifty-eight previous
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>diets were a powerful tribute to the tenacity of this illusion.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>If Floss stopped dieting, she would be forced to live with
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>out this protective screen, to accept herself as she was: a womar
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of great magnitude. A fat woman. Could she do this? She
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>wasn’t sure.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Suddenly, it became very clear to Floss that she was too fat
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>even to think about being acceptable. She had no right to be
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>in a public place eating, or even taking up space. She felt out
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of control of herself and her life. How could such a person ever
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>presume to talk about her rights? It was the meeting and al
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the brave things that were said there that were the big illusion.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>All morning, these thoughts roared through
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>Floss’s mind, spinning her round and round, deeper and deeper
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>into self-deprecation and despair. By the time one o’clock rolled
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>around, Floss was a wreck. She wanted to back out of the date
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>with Bert entirely. She was so upset, she could not speak the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>words that needed to be said. Instead she was gruff and aloof
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>Bert wasn’t surprised at the change in her new friend. Bert
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>had been through it all plenty of times herself. She told Floss
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>very firmly that she was going to have to take control of these
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>issues.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>Floss, you’re a big strong woman, you must vanquish that
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>monster again and again until it no longer has the strength to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>return.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>’Why don’t we pick up some sandwiches at the deli and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>take them over to Dolores Park? It’s a beautiful day. l’d love to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>be outside.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>&quot; hate eating sandwiches on my lap. I want a table in
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>front of me. We can go to the park after lunch if there’s still
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>time. Bert suggested one of the good restaurants on 24th
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>Street where they could enjoy well-cooked food at their leisure.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>&quot;No, let’s just go to the cafe. It’s easier there.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>&apos;What the hell is EVER easy? Iwant to treat you to a really
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>good meal. l’II bet you never treat yourself.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>Floss’s sheepish grin said &quot;You’re right and you win.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>women left the store and walked the short block to the corner
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>of Noe Street, where a royal blue awning advertised the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>restaurant.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>As she walked through the door, Floss checked
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>out the seating arrangements. Small tables were crowded one
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>upon another. She looked at Bert pleading, “Let&apos;s get out of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>here.&quot; But Bert forged ahead, requesting the waiter to find a
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>comfortable place for them. She turned to Floss to explain.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>room isn’t crowded. That is a reasonable thing to ask.&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>And it was done. The waiter found a table along the win
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>dow and pulled the surrounding tables back a few inches, giv
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ing them ample room. Bert thanked him and winked at Floss
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>as she sat down.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Bert was wearing a bright blue dashiki printed with a geo
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>metric design, blue corduroy pants and a dark blue cap.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Hmm, she looks terrific, Floss thought, and asked, &quot;Doyou
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>always wear a hat?
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>’Only when l’m not sleeping
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The waiter brought menus, water, and a basket of bread
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and butter. Bert dove in. &quot;You&apos;d think l’d get enough of this
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>stuff at the bakery, but lnever eat there, so l’m starving.&quot; She
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>pulled a piece of bread off the loaf and buttered it. &quot;Besides
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>we don’t make this sourdough at our bakery. Just sweet stuff.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Floss watched fascinated while Bert devoured her bread
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and then reached for another slice. Shoving the basket toward
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Floss, she said, &quot;Don’t you want any? It’s wonderful and hot.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The pungent aroma of meat roasting on charcoal added to the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>yeasty scent of the bread, filling the room. Floss felt her mouth
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>grow juicy, while her stomach rumbled. She tried not to smack
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>her lips.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>’No, thanks, l’m not very hungry.&quot; Floss lied. She had al
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ready decided that Bert could eat her share of the bread so
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>they wouldn’t have to ask for more.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Well, what do you want to eat? l’m starving. Bert was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>grinning, obviously enjoying herself immensely. &quot;Pick out what
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ever you want. This one’s on me. She rolled her tonque around
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>inside one cheek and picked up the elaborately calligraphied
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>sheet of paper that described the day’s specials.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Floss looked at her menu and decided on a bowl of Greek
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>lemon soup, agleomeno. That would be fine, but she knew
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>then and there that what she wanted more than anything else
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>in the world was some of that sourdough bread, thick and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>warm, to dip into the hot soup. She took a surreptitious look
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>at the bread basket to see if there really was enough for both
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of them just as Bert looked up from her menu.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>C&apos;mon Floss, have some bread.&quot; She pushed the basket
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>toward Floss. &quot;It’s delicious. C’mon, enjoy yourself. When the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>waiter comes, l’II ask for more.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Hesitantly, Floss reached into the basket and tore off a slice.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>There was still another piece left, and several squares of butter.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>This’Il be enough for me, l’m sure, she said, hoping that it
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>would be enough for Bert, too.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>It wasn’t. When the waiter returned, Bert immediately re
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>quested a refill of the basket and more water. Floss ordered
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the soup.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Don’t you want more than that?” Bert chided her. &quot;How
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>can you work all day and not eat more?” Bert ordered the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>soup, a large salad and a serving of spanikopeta. “Try some of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>that, Foss, you&apos;ll love it.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>’No, this is really all I want, Floss maintained. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>fiddling with her fork, tracing patterns on the blue checkered
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>tablecloth, trying to figure out what she was doing. She had
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>sat in restaurants before, but this feeling was something new.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>When she ate out with Janet or Shirley she might feel self
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>conscious, but somehow, because she was with them, eating
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>in public felt possible; only barely so, but manageable.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>This was definitely different. As she sat in her chair by the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>window and looked across at Bert, Floss felt a moment of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>panic that she was not going to get through this. Not in the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>same old way.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Floss might only order soup and skimp on bread, but Bert
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>would still have a fine time eating what she wanted. No matter
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>what she did, and regardless of whether she took any pleasure
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>for herself, Floss felt quilty by association with this fat woman
			</p>
			<pb n='71'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>who was joyously satisfyng her own needs. Floss felt like her
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>skin was peeling off, leavng nothing underneath but her fat,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>exposed and unprotected.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>At her home the previous evening, Floss had
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>been able to see Bert as another woman like herself, different in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>some ways, and with great information to share. Up to this point,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>their friendship had been amazingly easy. But out in public was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>another matter, for now there was no ignoring the substance
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of either of them. With Bert, Floss saw herself through the eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of the waiter, the other patrons in the restaurant, even the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>pedestrians on the sidewalk who stopped to look in the window.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Floss took a drink of water and all of her self-hatred boiled
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>up into her throat, gagging her, choking her. As she spluttered
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and coughed, the waiter
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>came over to see if he could
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>help. Floss felt eyes on her
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and wanted to die.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Something was happen

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stop it, nor any place to run.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>She took deep breaths and
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tried to get herself under con

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sided, Foss looked helplessly
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>across the table.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Bert saw the question in

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>in a pool of words in the bot

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>you live and be so fat?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; When
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Foss nodded yes, Bert asked,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>How are you feeling today
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>about the meeting last

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>&quot;There’s so much new

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and round in circles trying to

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>me. You know, Bert, I just
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>can&apos;t imagine saying that l&apos;m
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>not going to diet any more.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>It seems unamerican?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Foss chuckled, I quess

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>to start loving yourself. You
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>don’t have to put yourself down all the time just because you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>fat. Do you believe that?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>’Not really. I want to, but it’s so damned difficult. I hear
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>you talking, I listen to your words, and they’re magnificent.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>But then I walk down the street and every shop window pass
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>tells me how ugly l am, what a failure.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>&quot;That’s your judgements, Floss. That’s what you have to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>change. The time has come for you to make a decision. Stop
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>this eternal deprivation, this constant vigilante action you force
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N055'/>on yourself. Be free. Be a fat woman—a healthy, happy fat

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and smiling. Floss didn’t know how to respond. She felt some
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>thing springing loose all over her body, but since she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>recognize the feeling, she did not know that it was her soul
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>stretching for space.

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and some urge to hurt Bert let them slip out. &quot;Well, that&apos;s easy
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>for you to say.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The words hit their mark. Bert sat up and pulled her hat
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>down over her brow. &quot;What
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>does that mean, Floss? Do

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Floss looked at Bert&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>The food arrived. Bert
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>looked at Floss’s single bow
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and asked kindly, &quot;Want to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>change your mind and order
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>something else?

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>will be enough. Floss was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>drooling over the spinach pie
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>with steam rising out of its
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>delicate brown crust. Like a hungry dog, Floss watched every

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>By the time Floss climbed the hill to her home
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>that night, she was hungry and discouraged, too. She wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to believe Bert, but wasn’t sure that she dared. Although she
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>meant well, Bert’s pushing still made Floss feel defensive. The

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the more Floss felt like a failure. She did not know how to

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Floss realized that she would have to find a way herself.

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cesium-137 (half-life: 30.2 years) is beamed
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>through foods to preserve them. The
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>food does not become radioactive, but
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>some cells are altered by the radiation.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Mutations are formed. The gamma rays

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>2. Food irradiation plants use cesium
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>137, which is created as a byproduct of

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>1. Irradiation creates new chemicals
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in foods called &quot;radiolytic” products, in
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cluding hazardous compounds such as

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Some studies show that irradiated foods
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>cause cancer, kidney and liver disease,

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>with chemicals to prevent re-infestation
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of produce. So food will be irradiated in

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>4. Bacteria and viruses can develop
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>resistance to radiation, just as insects do
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to pesticides. Dangerous mutations and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>new strains of pest organisms may

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>5. The microorganisms that cause

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>activities: “Corn appears in virtually every Hopi ceremony

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Spirit gave all people a choice of destiny by offering them dif

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>would sustain us in a hard but enduring life.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>E: We have a commitment to raise the corn. We committed

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>E: The working of the corn is a very sacred thing. Because

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to plant, he has to push this dry surface away and eventually,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>he gets down to the moist dirt, and then into this soft place, he
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>puts the seed. The very sacredness of life is corn, and it is this

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Woman is manifested in the Hopi matrilocal tradition, where
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>everything is of the woman’s house—children, household goods
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and equipment, artistry, farming plots, orchards, etc.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The Hopi are a matrilineal, as well as a matrilocal, people.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In the Hopi world, the family unit consists of all blood-related

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>extended families. Since the Hopi have a matrilineal kinship
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>system, clan identification is passed along to the children
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>through the mother’s side of the family. If your mother is sun
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>clan, for example, then you are a Sun clan member Hopi clans
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>are also exogamous, which means that a member of a given

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tant to hear. My community and l are in the midst of a food

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>luxury, not for earning more money, but for our very survival.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Even at the village level we are very aware that the main
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>causes of our food crisis are economic and political. It is a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>direct result of governments and multinationals taking over
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>control and the means of production from us, the people, who
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>should have the right to feed ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>We are also aware that this food crisis is directly related to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Africa’s environmental crisis. In my village, when lwas a little
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>girl, we used to have many trees around and water used to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>flow out of springs. Today my children do not know what a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>spring is, because the water table has lowered so much.

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>As a women, the environmental decline means that lhave

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>grandmother did. So, if I want my agriculture to be sustaina
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ble, then my environment also must be sustainable.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Now, as l’ve said, this is not just my village’s food crisis, not

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>food production and distribution. We need to think of new

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that would demonstrate how allocations would differ if prior
