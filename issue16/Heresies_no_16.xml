			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The focus of Heresies f16 is on the work women have done,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and are doing, in film, video, and the media. In choosing this
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>focus, we hope to create a sense of community for other feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>who feel information is lacking in these areas. Much of the con
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tent in this issue would have little chance of being published else
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>where—and f16 provides some deserved publicity for these works.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The recent surge in technology has changed the way we commu
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>nicate, and women have an increasing opportunity to use differ
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ent forms of media. Our interest in technology is not to suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that women join the ranks of the technocrats, but rather to en
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>courage women to overcome a conditioned fear of technology
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and to begin to use it as an organizing tool and a source of per
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sonal expression.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Putting out a Heresies issue takes a long time, and although all
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of us had had some experience working on collectives and doing
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>political work, only one of us was familiar with the entire produc
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tion process. None of us found it easy, but on reflection, we have
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>managed to isolate some of the difficulties.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Like most nonhierarchical groups, one of the problems we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>failed to face was the distribution of work at each stage. We never
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>discussed what working on a collective meant to each of us, what
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>our personal commitments could be, or what a reasonable amoun
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of responsibility should be. The haphazard organization led to ai
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>unequal distribution of work. Some members took on more work
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>than others, and resentments grew. Because most of us could not
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>suspend all non-Heresies work, we all faced a decision in how we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>divided our time. These decisions were not clear-cut. Work outside
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Heresies can be motivated by a desire for personal gain, but it can
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>also have political intent. These choices can also be parallelec
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>within the collective. One works for Heresies to experience collec
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tive process, to contribute to a magazine committed to change, on
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to network with other feminists; but it is also possible that one
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>might participate to gain recognition in the artworld. Ultimately
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>these choices determined how much work we did for this issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The problem of workload was compounded by unrealistic
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>deadlines: for submissions, for rewrites, for editing, and for pro
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>duction. The collective felt further confusion because of the lack of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>a clear definition of f16’s theme. The initial grant proposal was for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>a film and TV issue, but by the time our collective was meeting
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>regularly, the main collective had expanded the theme to include
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>all communication media. Early debates about whether to empha
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>size commercial or artistic work were then further clouded by dis
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>cussions of all forms of media. All these problems forced us to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>hurry through crucial early stages of the collective’s formation.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Under pressure, we never adequately examined the aesthetic,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>political, racial, and sexual differences among us. Disputes about
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the materials—their style, their content, and their feminist politic
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>—were frequently taken on a purely personal level, outside of thein
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>political context. Feminism, like every movement for change, faces
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>conflict about strategy. Issue 16’s subject matter—the very infor
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>mation channels through which we try to effect change—guaran
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>teed us plenty of conflict. Although we were united in our desire to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>challenge the male-dominated media system, our personal choices
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>about the forms of media we worked in outside of Heresies differed
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>greatly. These other experiences affected how we chose material
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>for the issue, and these differences were implicit in our discussions.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>For instance, is there a correct way to present women’s images?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Can we infiltrate the mass media, or should we leave it alone? Is it
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>possible to present radical content in a conventional form? Al
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>times, positions taken by collective members on such issues were
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>mutually exclusive. The wide range of material in the issue reflects
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>these disparate visions. Many of our discussions about articles
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>forced us to define as well as to defend our own ideas and beliefs
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>about media work. We were each strongly committed to our own
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>forms, but we did come to realize that other women could be as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>committed to different forms. In the long run, however, some of us
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>grew apart because those differences could not be overcome.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Only one woman on the ff16 collective is Black, indicating a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lack of outreach to Third World and Black communities. Heresies
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>has a poor reputation for dealing with the concerns of women of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>color, and not enough distributors in Third World communities
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sell the magazine. The content of many of the previous issues has
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>not reflected the needs of Third World women, and no adequate
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>mechanism has yet been put into place to address these problems.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>What Heresies needs is more visibility in Third World communi
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ties. The Heresies collective should more actively solicit Third
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>World women for the main collective and the issue collectives. Per
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>haps then women of color would be more interested in submitting
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>material and suggesting topics for future issues, thus broadening
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Heresies’ horizons.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The difficulties of f16 arose mostly because we lacked fore
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sight. Future collectives could approach these problems by taking
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the time early in the process to investigate the differences among
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>members, and use this knowledge to establish their own working
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>structure. Lulls in the development of the magazine—for instance,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>after the call for submissions and before material begins to arrive
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>—could provide this time. The main collective could help further
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>by giving a realistic chart of how an issue develops, indicating the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>time period required for each of the various phases of producing a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>As with most issues of Heresies, f16’s topic was too broad to be
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>covered by one issue. One thing that we agreed about was the neec
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>for a new journal in which to continue a dialogue about, and devel
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>op networks within, the vital feminist film/video/media arts com
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>munity. At this time, the more activist feminist press devotes little
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>space to such work. The few journals which address women and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>film/video concern themselves far more with the male media por
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>trayal of women than with the growing body of work produced by
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>women. The feminist academic journals limit themselves to oc
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>casional articles on feminist theory and criticism. As women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>studies becomes co-opted by the university system, outspoken fem
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>inist academics are fired, and feminism becomes more threatened
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>such a journal becomes crucial to continue the dialogue about
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>feminist media. Now is the time to expand our audience to include
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>a wider base of women. We see this issue as part of this dialogue.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>perspective is asking for trouble. Primarily
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>money kind of trouble, since getting fund
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing for such projects these days is like pull

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>shooting, editing, and writing the film.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>When finally the film is finished, you face
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the hurdle of distribution. Few distributors
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>are interested in films with an explicit po
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>litical focus, so you’re on your own. The
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>distribution work will keep you busy for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>years, if you want the film to be shown a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>lot. This doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>make money, unless you’re lucky and get
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sales instead of rentals. But often groups
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that want to show political films have very
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>little money and can barely afford a rental.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>In other words, making an independent,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>politically oriented film takes tremendous
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>commitment and enthusiasm, at times to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the point of obsession and fanaticism. You
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>also have to believe very strongly that this
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>particular film just has to be made.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I discovered my need to make Women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in Arms little by little. First I was fasci
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>nated by the newspaper reports of the pres
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ence of a young woman, Comandante Dos,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in the bold takeover of the National As
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>sembly building in Nicaragua by a group
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of Sandinistas. Then I heard more and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>more about the very active role of women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>in the military as well as political aspects
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of the Sandinist resistance. On a visit to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Panama a friend showed me a letter writ
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ten by a Nicaraguan woman, Idania, to her
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>six-year-old daughter, explaining that she
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>had to return to Nicaragua and risk death
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>so that the children of their country would
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>be able to have a better future. Shortly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>after writing the letter, Idania was in fact
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>killed by the Nicaraguan National Guard.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Once I was in Nicaragua I heard more
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>stories and met with several women from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the resistance, but it wasn’t until I visited
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the liberated zone of Managua that I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>understood the enormity of what was hap

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>side with the men in a very dangerous situ
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ation and this, I was told, was nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>unique. (It was on trying to enter this same
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>liberated area that ABC correspondent Bill
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Stewart was killed in cold blood by the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>National Guard.) The visceral experience
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of fear I describe in my journal fueled me
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with an intense sense of the reality of these
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>women’s lives; my admiration for the wom
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>en was no longer an abstraction. All this
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>helped me in the making of my film. At
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>times when the money had run out and I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was desperate, I thought of the women and

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to a manageable size.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I believe that as documentary filmmak

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>what the people we are filming go through.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>It tests our will and determination to de

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>between us and the subjects. Obviously we

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Scared. I don’t think l’ve ever been as scared in my life as I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>have been today, at least not for a very long time
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>After a lot of disorganized organizing l’m off with Alan, Alain,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and Alma to the liberated zone of the city to interview the Sandinist
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>leaders. My co-worker Mikko finally showed up this morning; he
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>had arranged for us to have a press conference with them this
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>morning at 11, at a place called Puente Eden. The directions for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>finding it: Just ask around.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>l’m eager to go and see the blockades and. the muchachos. We
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>drive only a short way around the hill where Somoza’s bunker is,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>then leave the car by the road and start heading for one of the side
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>streets. We ask for the Puente Eden. A man with a thin, drawn
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>face, Mario Solorzano, offers to take us there with his six-year-old
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>son Jesus, saying he was headed in that direction because he had
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>relatives living there. We turn a corner and hear pretty heavy
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>shooting nearby. We rush back and start contemplating whether
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the effort is worthwhile. Alan favors leaving; Alain and Alma want
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to go ahead, block by block if necessary. “You mean just the way
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>you live, day by day, comments Alan. I remain neutral, somewhat
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>siding with Alan, but wanting to go, though I started feeling scared.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Alain carries our makeshift truce flag, a Hotel Intercontinental
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>towel attached to a stick. We sprint from corner to corner, staying
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>close to the walls of the mostly abandoned buildings. A lot of fallen
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>branches on the streets, probably shot down during heavy bursts of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>fire.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>We come to our first barricade, built out of adoquines, those
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>cement bricks used to pave the country’s highways. Ideal for con
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>structing barricades. The entire intersection is a maze of trenches,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with little coves fenced by a board, providing a place to burrow
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>into in case of an aerial attack. Ten young muchachos and mucha
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>chas, boys and girls, are guarding the place. A blondish young
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Sandinista (they are all young) takes a lot of time deciding if he’l
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>give us permission to go to the Puente Eden or not. He looks at our
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>credentials and is glad none of us is American. He argues about
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>our safety and worries about who should accompany us—an armed
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>or an unarmed person. That’s when Mario identifies himself and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>says he’d be willing to lead us there. A very young guy is also as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>signed to accompany us, at least some of the way.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I see the first Sandinista with something resembling a uniform,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>namely an olive green jacket. Most of the people we meet at the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>dozen or so barricades we pass wear very little to identify them
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>selves as Sandinistas. I see a black beret with a piece of narrow red
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ribbon, or some kind of red insignia. Many young women, most of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>them armed with pistols. They are very friendly, as are the boys.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>once we tell them we’re journalists and have permission to pass
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>through. Nobody once searched us; they trusted us even though
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>someone tells me the Guardia sends in women with bags contain-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ing bombs.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>At each barricade we are told that the strip ahead might be ex
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>tremely dangerous. Franco-tiradores, sharpshooters. Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>bullets whizz very close by. A push-pull plane circles in the sky,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>mortaring the area. At one point Alan tells us a bomb is coming
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>because he has seen it fall. All those details piling up in quick
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>succession scare me very much—also the constant running from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>one block to the next, this whole idea that we must keep moving
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Even crossing the street seems very dangerous. Everything is start
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>ing to seem very dangerous to me. Alma comments that it is sur
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>prising so many people do come out alive, considering the number
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>of bullets flying in the air. Small comfort.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>We get to a Red Cross post. They warn us that the next stretch
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>is going to be very dangerous. I am sweaty and tired, my heart is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>beating fast. I am ready to give up. I can’t look around too much
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>since I have to concentrate all my strength on just dealing with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>my fear.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Alain mentions that fear lodges in different parts of the body.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Suddenly I feel my left breast most vulnerable and hold my Guate-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>malan bag to it, thinking how odd because that’s not the side where
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the heart lodges. But of course it is. I can’t tell left from right. Fear
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>starts making me shaky, and that seems dangerous. I try to breathe
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>deep, but can’t for more than a few seconds at a time. We move on
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and on. Finally we come to a kind of central gathering place. A
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>slight rest. I think I won’t be able to continue any further. A young
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>woman in olive green uniform and black beret is scanning the sky
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to see what a push-pull bomber is doing. “No, it’s too high to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>bomb us right now, she says. “When it returns to where we are it
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>will have run out of bombs, she assures us.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It seems we are waiting for something. Alma calms me by tell
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ing me that the more nervous I become the more dangerous it will
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>be because I won’t be able to think straight or act clearly. She is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>right. I feel better. Surprise, surprise, Margarita shows up! She is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>in charge of taking us to the leaders. I feel relieved that there’s
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>someone I know, though it is no protection against the bullets. We
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>follow her, and for some unexplainable reason stop at a barricade.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>A few muchachos are around. I talk with them about the basics,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and also about fear. They mention their slogan, Patria libre o morir
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>(“Homeland free or die”), and explain that even the muchachos,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the most irregular of the fighting forces, have had some political as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>well as military training. They’re no longer afraid, or maybe they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>just used to it. But going in cold, without the experience of military
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>service or other battlegrounds, you react the way I do. The others
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>are afraid too, but they don’t express it as openly as I do.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>On the move again. Some people are still living in this area. An
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>old man peeks out a window. A young woman is crocheting a yel
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>low tablecloth on the footsteps of her house. Other people keep
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>their front doors open and are sitting inside in their rocking chairs
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>as if nothing much out of the ordinary were going on outside. But
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>long stretches of the streets are totally deserted.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>We run, stop, and peer around a corner. The muchacho guide
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>told us, at one point, that if we heard a hissing sound we should
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>throw ourselves on the ground and keep our mouths open so our
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>eardrums won’t burst. A mortar explodes very close to us. I am flat
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>on my stomach in a split-second.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Running, trying to look around, my heart pounding, feet get-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ting tired, and fear making me pant and almost panic. I think I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>may die just because right now I am very happy, a happiness I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>I don’t deserve. All kinds of little images going through my head. I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>admire the muchachos who have spent days and weeks working on
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>this liberated zone.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Finally we have arrived where the leaders are. I can’t believe it.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>But yes, we are at the safehouse. Someone gives me a pill to take.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>seeing that I am very shaken. A woman gives me a glass of water
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>and someone tells her to give me a few drops of valerian too. I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>remember as a child taking that bitter-tasting drug for my nervous
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>upset stomach. She rummages through her first aid kit, a flowered
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>picnic bag, but she doesn’t have any
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>The press conference. We sit on metal beds without mattresses.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>After a while the pill starts working and l’m in a good mood. Three
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>people introduce themselves. I recognize one man from pictures.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>He has a clean look about him, a neat moustache and light tan
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>army jacket; he holds an Uzi, no it must be a Gallil. Next to me is a
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>youngish man with bright eyes and curly short hair, and a pistol
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>lying next to him. Then I see Moises Hassan, sitting with legs
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>crossed on the floor. He looks grubby with his untrimmed beard
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and thick glasses, but cheerful. Colorful swirls pattern his blue shirt.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I have a hard time focusing on what they’re talking about. Firs
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>come rounds of rhetoric, the definition of the structures of the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>struggle. Then we’re told about this liberated zone and how hard
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the work was that went into building it. They are very proud of this
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>liberated zone. It is vast, not quite half of Managua, maybe one
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>fourth, and what used to be a very densely populated area. The
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>zone is concrete proof of the insurrection and the people’s partici
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>pation in it. They talk about the Somoza regime’s atrocities—facts
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>we already know well.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I look at the house and try to focus on observing things to calm
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>my fear and anxiety about the return trip ahead of us. Hassan, who
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>is now a member of the Sandinist junta, says the leadership moves
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>from house to house; this is their base for only a very brief moment
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>It is a small one-room house, 15 x 15. Seems newly built from the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>inside, or at least reinforced. From the outside it doesn’t differ
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>much from the modest wooden houses in the area. All around is a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>four-foot high wall made of thick cinder blocks; above that a pan
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>eling of thick slabs of wood looks very fresh. A few chairs, beds
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the windows are opaque glass. On one wall a framed picture of a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cherub’s face against a star-studded pink background. Another
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>picture, some remote cityscape, Paris perhaps. A baby’s cot. Sev
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>eral kids running around. Hassan says they belong to the people
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>who live in the house. He shows me the bomb shelter they’ve dug in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the backyard, some ten feet deep, covered with boards and a layer
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of cinder blocks. A little girl is sitting on a mattress at the bottom
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of the shelter. I tell Hassan all this reminds me of the war in Fin
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>land when Helsinki was being bombed. I remember the night sky
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lighting up from the flares.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>They all smoke cigarettes constantly, except for Hassan. A
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>young woman guards the door. She cannot yet be 20. She has a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pistol next to her on the floor. Smiles are returned, the atmosphere
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>is very relaxed, though throughout the hour and a half we spend in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the house we constantly hear the sounds of shooting, mortars ex
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ploding, and push-pull planes circling above us.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>We talk about the provisional government which has just been
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>formed. They sound basically like Social Democrats. They feel
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>everyone should participate in the transitional phase of reconstruc-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tion, even the bourgeoisie. I ask what the role of the Guerra Popu
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>lar Prolongara and the Insurrectionistas will be.* Hassan is quick
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to point out that they’ll have to wait for the elections. If the people
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>want them, then that’s how it will be, he says.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>We cover a lot of ground. After an hour we take a break to take
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>pictures. I, too, pose with the three, smiling so none of my fear
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>should show. I think l’d like to stay; it’s comfortable, and I would
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>not have to face the mad dash to get back to the world with their
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>messages. They indeed invite us to stay. Alan says he’s sorry he
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>can’t stay since there’s no telex or telephone. Alma makes a crack
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>about Alan needing his well-ironed clothes and creature comforts.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Alain is game, though he’s been as afraid as me
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Although we’re all set to go, to avoid the heavy shooting that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>starts after lunch, we’re told there will be another little meeting.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Two guys arrive. One is a very young man, big and dark-skinned,

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>at us. At his waist he has tucked a pistol. The other one is Joaquin.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>He sits across from me, a slight man with a small-featured face. He
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>has two deep furrows in his forehead. His greenish eyes seem dis
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tant; he is somewhere else.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The two men talk mostly about the military aspects of what’s
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>been happening. The darker man details the facts and figures.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Joaquin talks about other things. He is optimistic, but his face tells
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>another story. It is full of pain and profound sadness. I’d like to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>kiss him and hug him. What’s the drug they’ve given me anyhow?
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I feel good about meeting the leadership and seeing that they are
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>people who seem to have their shit together. I feel these two are
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>pointing out that the struggle can’t be won overnight. Are they
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>then part of the other factions, the GPP and the Insurrectionistas?
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Despite all the talk of unity, I get the feeling it isn’t terribly solid.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>It’s finally time to go—1:30, time for the shooting to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>again. Many details I don’t understand in Spanish, some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>directions and such. My survival instinct, however, makes me
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>understand perfectly all the signs and even rapid phrases having
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to do with potential dangers. I give Hassan and José Antonio the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>message about the airport being pretty lightly guarded, ammuni
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tions and arms having arrived by land via Honduras, and two
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>planeloads of military stuff. They appreciate the information and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>say we should denounce this flow of arms to Somoza. I would like
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to ask them how they cope with fear. I don’t. I leave them a pack of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>cigarettes, Rubios. They laugh and say it has become the brand of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the war. I don’t quite understand why. I feel silly asking them if I
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>can come back to the liberated zone to talk with the women fight
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ers. I admit to them that I don’t know how l’d make it, because
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>already this time I have been very very scared.

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tired, I run out of breath and want to pause often. Now I know
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>more or less where we’re heading. I have no sense of the distances.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>We see a long line of people waiting for the food rations of the day.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>We hear the sound of airplanes. Someone tells the people in line to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>move close to the houses, into the shade of trees. They are still
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>living here, and they keep their doors open. It seems weird to be
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>jogging in this doubled-up fashion, panting and afraid, and then
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to catch glimpses of the calm interiors of people’s houses. The
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>usual neat, simple interiors, tile floors and rattan furniture. Wom

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Now we move faster than before because the muchachos at the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>barricades know us and let us through with no trouble. At many
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>posts it is lunchtime. Plates of rice and beans. At the Puente Leon
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>we take a different road from the one we came. We have to cross a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>wide open stretch of grassy land. Alma runs sort of zigzag. I just
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>run. We’re along the highway now, with very few people around.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>For blocks, only abandoned houses and angry dogs—the least
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>thing to be afraid of here. l’m actually too exhausted to even think
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>about fear anymore. l’m too tired to bend my head low. Several
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>times we hear fire very close by. At one barricade there’s some
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>hassle, they don’t want us to go on. We’re told they can’t guarantee
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>our safety beyond this point. The guide Mario and his little boy
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Jesus are still with us. Mario says he’Il take us out.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>At the next barricade young militias sit and eat lunch in the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>shade of a tree. They are all very skinny. One wears a wide-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>brimmed hat with the rim turned up and FSLN in black letters on
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>it. To see a human face shining fills me with joy. I say hello, they
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>say adios. Yes, a dios, to God, that’s the appropriate greeting in a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>time and place such as this.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>On our own again, we take out a Hotel Intercontinental towel.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Mario holds it in one hand and holds his little boy’s hand with the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>other. We run in a kind of no-man’s land. A Sandinist medic
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>comes over and informs us that the road ahead is bad. Mario say.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>he knows a roundabout way of getting there by crossing a narrow
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>bridge to get to the other side of the road.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>I am the first one to cross. I jump over a chasm to get to the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>bridge because a large part of it is missing.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>feel like a moving target for a sniper. I run for
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the houses, to find shelter in their shade. The
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>medic and a Sandinist fighter argue which way
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to go. The barrio is totally deserted, except for
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>a man playing baseball alone in a yard, throw-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ing or, rather, batting the ball against the wall.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Thump, thump, thump, the only sound here be
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>sides the gunfire in the distance and the sound
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of the airplanes in the sky.

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the same direction we are. l’m beginning to feel much safer—we
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>have made it alive. We pass a movie theater, the Select. I wonder
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>when a movie was last shown there. Approaching an intersection
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>we stop short. Across the street we see a Sandinist guerrilla. We
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>holler to him, and he waves for us to cross the street. As we do we
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>see flimsy barricades made of tree branches on both sides. Behind
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>one, quite a few people. I hope they’re Sandinistas and won’t shoot.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>We cross safely.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Further on, we come to a fence and behind it a barracks-like
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>building. Little Jesus tells me it is his school. We must be close to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the car. At least now we’re out of the zone. My mouth is dry, I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>an intense heat radiating from me. I ask Alma if we should give
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Mario some money and I wonder why he took us. He never even
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tried to visit the relatives he said he wanted to see. Alma says he is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>either a real patriot or an oreja, a spy. She has several dollars to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>give him. I want to give him 100 pesos. Alain also wants to con
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tribute.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Finally I spot the three colored circles on the wall of the house
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>where we left the car. I am ready to cry, grateful we have made it. I
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>take a picture of Jesus and his father. We leave them the Inter
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>continental flag. Alan doesn’t make a contribution.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Alma says we should cool down before going to the hotel. I
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>don’t feel like walking alone in the streets so Alan drives me back
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>to the Estrella. A lot of people are sitting in the lobby. They see
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that something has happened to me. Lenora asks if l’ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>beaten. No, I say, l’ve just been running a little bit. Richard has
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>left for Rivas, leaving a note saying he’ll probably stay all night. I
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>need him to hold me in his arms. I drink glasses of water, take two
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Valiums, and fall asleep
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>But I have to start working on the material we risked so much
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to get. It calls for all the strength I have to concentrate on writing.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I look at my red face in the mirror. The terror of the experience.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>The worst part of it was not knowing where we were going and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>where the lines of fire were. I didn’t know who was shooting whom
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and from what direction to expect the bullets. They were every
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>where. I had to trust those who led us. And I did trust them—but
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>not myself. The situation was so new.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Richard arrives just before curfew. He had been close to Rivas,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>but had turned around at the post where the old Guardia had
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>helped me and Mikko get to Rivas last week. A post where the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>soldiers played cards and lay sleeping in hammocks in the noonday
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>heat with chickens pacing around. A scene to be filmed, a scene
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>that couldn’t be reproduced.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>l’m exhausted, shaken. Revolution is a hell of a thing. Only a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>long process can make people face what I faced today. I saw every-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>thing as simply horrible and frightening. The young woman peer

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>home, where any temporary economic advancement for women
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>only reflects the opportunism of the government rather than a true

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>experiencing for decades, refuse to take it any longer and become
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>armed fighters against the government. Their position is that op

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>values must change and become embedded in practice.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The narrative of the film is disjunctive, cutting between various

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>cultural positions within the women&apos;s community. The ideas for

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>film who, to various degrees, play themselves. The title of the film
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>is meant to suggest that even though an armed revolutionary move
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ment may be impossible to sustain, it will survive as a thorn in the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>side of the culture. The armed activities are directed primarily
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>against the media in order to appropriate the language, even for a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>moment. The film also expresses the hope that women will be able

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>consider CR an organizing issue, so then

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>have such a use. It was a personal tape. I
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>used it in a working-class neighborhood in

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>more difficult to use other kinds of film

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and it was, like, the most incredible, absolutely incredible experi-

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the more conscious I became around sexuality, the less I liked
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>fucking ’cause I always knew that I wasn’t going to get what I
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>wanted, although if I knew the man then I could feel free to ask or

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>almost a year.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The first time these tapes were shown was at the Grey Art Gal
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>lery at New York University in May 1976. It took us two days to set
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>up the show and it was to open on the third day at 11 a.m. I arrived
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>at 10 and was greeted at the door with the news that the tapes were
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>not going to be permitted to be shown. News had filtered to the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Dean and the Head of the Department that there were THESE
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>MASTURBATING TAPES among the installations. Their reac
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tion was NO GO. I was furious; they hadn’t even seen the tapes.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Instantaneously, the Directors of the Gallery (a man and a woman)
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stampeded me; l&apos;invited them to view the tapes. They I
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>turned on the five TVs, they took one glance and yanked me to the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>back room. If the MEDIA,” they said, “got hold of this, the Gal
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lery would be closed down. Oh, they UNDERSTOOD what I was
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>trying to do with the tapes, but I just had to understand their posi
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tion. I understood—CENSORSHIP. They then told me of a show
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>that they had had the year before in which there was a painting of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a woman’s crotch; the Board of Directors almost closed them
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>down. That did it. I promised them a woman&apos;s demonstration that
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>very afternoon in front of the Grey Gallery, if they didn’t allow me
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to show the tapes. They said that they then would close the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>show. &quot;Fine, I said, close the whole show, but you’re not going
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to censor the tapes.” Istormed out, went directly to the NYU
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Women’s Center, and by a freak of timing, I ran into one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>women in the tapes. We decided à leaflet was in order. She made
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the leaflet while I got on the phone, calling as many women as
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>came to mind. The leaflet was finished. I ran over to the local
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>xerox place and had 200 copies made up. Within 20 minutes of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>storming out of the Grey Gallery, I was handing out the leaflets in
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>front of it. I had handed out four when they CHANGED their
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>minds.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Anyway, the tapes were shown—interesting reactions. Women
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>câme to me saying that they had never seen another woman&apos;s geni
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>tals before, or that they didn’t know that other women mastur-
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>bated, or how did I get the courage?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>The five TVs were set up in a straight line (bird’s eye view) as a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>hypotenuse, with the two adjacent sides being the walls. The tapes
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>were started simultaneously. People had to come in to see the tapes
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and sit on the floor (there were small pillows and a rug) next to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>other people.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>It was clear on walking in that the mood of the tapes was seri
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ous and lively. And after each viewing there usually was a spon
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>taneous discussion; a lot of people had something to say or ask. I
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>felt alive and really happy to share the tapes.

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for every palate—every palate that can pay, that is. This menu is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>strictly for those that still have jobs and surplus enough to pay the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>monthly cable bills. The “revolution” is in fact an electronic era of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>supply-side” information that turns the very word communica
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tion into a euphemism. The main effect of the new technologies is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a growing information gap—between the information haves and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the have nots. Which side are women on?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N016'/>The Industry
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N017'/>Most of the information we get comes from the networks, major
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N018'/>newspapers, weekly and monthly magazines, book publishers, and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N019'/>record and movie companies that are wholly owned or subsidiaries
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N020'/>of the “information giants.”1 The tremendous growth of this sec
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N021'/>tor has pushed the communications trans-national corporations
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N022'/>into the forefront of the expansion of capital. With this expansion,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N023'/>more and more of the culture of the world has come under a system
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N024'/>of domination by these media industries that is more subtle and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N025'/>insidious than the British Empire. Indeed, the sun never sets on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N026'/>ET or Charlie’s Angels. Like the empires of old, the media corpor
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N027'/>ations have felt the need to expand or die. This tendency, coupled
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N028'/>with the world economic crisis, has led them to exact ever greater
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N029'/>tolls from the population at home. The essence of cable is that it is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N030'/>a way to charge for media programming. Audiences have always
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N031'/>paid for the largest share of the media empire—the equipment to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N032'/>receive the signals. They also have paid for programming through
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_17' n='N033'/>increased prices on the commodities advertised.2 With the advent
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_18' n='N034'/>of cable, they will pay yet again. Cable is not broadcast. It comes
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_19' n='N035'/>into the home through a wire, and as such can be metered and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_20' n='N036'/>charged for. Of course, the glowing predictions of electronic diver-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_21' n='N037'/>sity never mention the price tag. (The third of the U.S. population
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_22' n='N038'/>now receiving cable is also receiving monthly information bills
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_23' n='N039'/>soon to be as common as electric or gas statements.) Nor is there
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_24' n='N040'/>mention of the fact that this information comes into our homes on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_25' n='N041'/>one wire. However many channels or services, it is owned and pro
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_26' n='N042'/>vided by one source. This fact is obscured by the predictions of a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_27' n='N043'/>70- to 100-channel capacity for the new systems. The “range of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_28' n='N044'/>choice” is often cited as the reason there is no longer a need for air-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_29' n='N045'/>wave regulation. A close look at the reality of the new cable pro-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_10_1_tl_30' n='N046'/>gramming should quickly dispel any lingering hopes about the

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>Sklover’s understanding of video art places it more or less in a
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>gallery context. In contrast, she perceives the current market for
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>television as narrative. That is what people want, what people
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>understand, and what she likes, especially well-crafted, emotive,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>Hollywood movies.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>If an independent can put a narrative in a can today, one pro

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>Sklover. The film Smithereens, produced by Susan Sidelson, is a
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>noted example. The budget for that film ran 880,000. In two
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>months after its release in November 1982, the film grossed ap
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>proximately S118,000.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>“It used to be there were seven banks where an independent

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>If they didn’t give you the money, you didn’t make your program.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>That’s changed.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>There has never been so much competition in the marketplace,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_56' n='N055'/>Sklover concludes. While some experts contend the pie is being cut
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_57' n='N056'/>into smaller pieces, other studies claim the market is growing
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_58' n='N057'/>People are watching more TV. The investment community is ner

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_62' n='N061'/>Sklover anticipates some interesting possibilities regarding new
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_63' n='N062'/>technology. She encourages younger artists and independents to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_64' n='N063'/>investigate the areas of interactive video disc, video games, and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_65' n='N064'/>video music—areas she labels as “hot,” some being very experi

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_67' n='N066'/>cassettes like 45rpm singles. She expects video will follow suit.

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>From Sklover’s perspective, “The more information you have,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the more it can serve you. The less information you have, the less it

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>will be the ones to manipulate it. Technology, she believes, is a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tool and tools have to be acted upon to make something happen.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In her opinion, the movement of the studios and networks into the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>new technologies and the cable marketplace is a positive sign be
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>cause they bring more money to the table, generating more dollars

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>A producer, usually one with some kind of track record, can sell a

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>produced. The producer can then take that guarantee to an in
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>vestor in an attempt to negotiate financing. A pre-sale is also called
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>a licensing fee.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Sklover notes, “I know a film producer in upstate New York
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>who makes features for kids. He pre-sells to German TV and cable.

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>though, since by 1916 silent picture audiences had come to expect
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a Weber film to use cinema’s emotional power to dramatize a so
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cial issue. In the early decades of the twentieth century a Webei

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>raries compared her to Griffith, citing her technical innovation
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and artistic ability. During her 26-year career Weber made at least
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>150, and probably as many as 400, films—most of which have been
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>lost or destroyed.2 Some were “one-reelers”—quickly produced
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and often used as “chasers” between film showings or vaudeville
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>acts—but many were features and among the biggest box office
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>attractions of the silent film era. Almost all of Weber’s films were
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>melodramas dealing with controversial subjects such as capita
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>punishment, opium use, child labor, marriage, divorce, economic
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>injustice, and birth control.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Frequently, Weber collaborated with her husband, Phillips
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Smalley, in writing, directing, and acting, but by 1915 she had come
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to be known as Universal’s top director, and the majority of the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>couple’s films credited Weber with the direction. Although some
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>pictures were ambiguously billed as “by the Smalleys, one jour
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>nalist reported that “Phillips Smalley came to her for advice upon
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>every question that presented itself.” 3 In 1917 Lois Weber Produc
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tions (Weber’s own company and studio) was created, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>signed with Paramount to distribute her films for the then incredi
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ble sum of S50,000 per film plus half the profits.* At the time
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Weber’s films were both noted and notorious, yet changes in
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>American society and in the film industry itself contributed signifi
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>cantly to the decline of her career. She died in poverty in 1939 and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>today is only rarely mentioned by film historians and critics.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Those who have begun to examine Weber’s life and films tend
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to see her either as wholly conservative or as the archetypal “new

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sphere. 5 When one considers Weber’s self-perception and defini-

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and her motives for directing films, she is less easy to label. How

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Lois Weber was born in Allegheny, Pennsylvania, in 1882—
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>three years after Eadweard Muybridge stimulated international
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>inventors to develop motion pictures by patenting his method of
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>taking sequential still photographs of objects in motion. Weber’s
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was a strongly Protestant family, and her parents’ intense religiosi
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ty would influence the rest of her life. After a short career as a con
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cert pianist, she became a member of the Church Army, an organi
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>zation similar to the Salvation Army. As a “Church Home Mis
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sionary,” she sang hymns at the rescue mission, on street corners,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>in industrial slums, and in the red light districts of Pittsburgh.“
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Weber was dedicated to this work, and the impression it made
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>upon her is visible years later in her choice of subjects for her films
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and her vivid depiction of prostitutes, waifs, working girls, and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>drunkards.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>There is some evidence that Weber next tried a career as an
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>opera singer in New York City, living on little money and financing

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pupils. ” Sometime between 1900 and 1903 Weber’s uncle in Chi
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cago convinced her that she should try the theatrical stage. As she

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The rationale that persuaded her that this work had a higher moral
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>purpose later became part of Weber’s philosophy about her film

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>While working as an actress in comedies and melodramas, she
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>met and married Phillips Smalley. In 1908, when Smalley was out
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>on tour and Weber was in New York, she began to work in films at
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Gaumont. She worked on the early experiments with “sound-on
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>cylinder” talkies, writing the short scenarios and the dialogues
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>which were recorded on phonograph records and synchronized
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>with the action. Yet, like other companies at the time, Gaumont
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>soon abandoned the idea of developing sound pictures in favor of
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>perfecting the silent movie. Weber’s main task became acting in

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>power of narrative cinema and put it to use.9 By writing, acting,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and eventually directing. Weber was able to give cinematic ser
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>mons to a broad audience.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>In a 1915 article entitled “How I Became a Motion Picture
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Director,” Weber described how, as she began to work in close col
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>laboration with Herbert Blaché at Gaumont, she “discovered little
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>defects here and there; a chance to improve the action occasional
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ly; a new line to etch in that strengthened a character, and a hun
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>dred and one other things that enlarged the scene and gave it
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>finish.”1° Although she attributed her separate director status to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the company’s expansion, Weber underlined such “attention to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>detail” as one of the director’s highest responsibilities. Indeed,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>according to one report, Weber personally went over every inch of
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>her films, “scrutinizing each tiny picture closely, keen to detect a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>face obscured or any false trick of the camera or error of the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>actor.”11 In addition to stressing women’s valuable attention to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>detail,2 in her public discussions Weber used the Victorian defini
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>tion of woman as inherently emotional, religious, sensitive, and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>morally superior to account for her success as a director. Both she
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>and her interviewers frequently pointed out her “natural” talent
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>for depicting emotion and romance, as well as her skillful “media

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Weber and her publicists wanted to assure the public that although
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>she was a successful and controversial director, she was still a “real
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>woman.”15 In 1917, one reporter commented on the feminine touch
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>which ran through the new Lois Weber Studios:
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Its broad grounds, with rose bushes and shade trees, the swing
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in the backyard, the wide hospitable doors, and the long hand-

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>stead.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>A writer for The Ladies Home Journal also remarked about the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>“feminine” studio and added that Weber “treats her co-workers as
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a family.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>While many writers portrayed Weber as an “ordinary” woman
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>who happened to be a motion picture director, others felt more
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>comfortable depicting her as an “exceptional” woman. Trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>reconcile the tension between what a woman was supposed to be
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and what Weber was, many commentators suggested she was extra
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ordinary not because of her individual talent, but because she
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>possessed “masculine traits” in addition to her feminine nature.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>One article, entitled “A Lady General of the Motion Picture Army
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>—Lois Weber Smalley, Virile Director,” began by describing “the

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>plays of supermasculine virility and punch.””18 The author used
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>military, royal, and “masculine” metaphors throughout the piece
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and then completely switched metaphors to reveal how “feminine
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>she was in her own home. Another article quoted Carl Laemmle,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>head of Universal:
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Miss Weber has the strength of a man, all the hardness of

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>visioning and the strictly practical, womanly ability to concentrate

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>While reviewers and publicists sketched the picture of Weber
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>as “Domestic Directress” or “androgynous” genius, Weber herself
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>contributed much to the perception of her as a woman primarily
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>carrying out a sacred moral duty, and only secondarily an artist. In

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>early life, it is clear how Weber could see herself as a motion pic
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ture “missionary” whose motivation was neither personal fulfill
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ment nor self-aggrandizement.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Weber’s stated purpose was to promote a moral way of life, yet
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her films often contained frank discussions of controversial social
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>issues. Although traditionalists might agree with her moral stance,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>some objected to the “modern” way in which taboo subjects were
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>openly dealt with in her films. Speaking of the highly controversial
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pro-birth control theme in Where Are My Children? (1916), Weber
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>explained:
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The theme should be brought to the attention of every thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>man and woman, and if others, from prudery, are fearful of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>addressing themselves to such a topic, it is no reason why I
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>should shirk what I regard as a sacred duty.22
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>In defense of Hypocrites (1914), a film that shocked many by using
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a nude girl to represent the figure of truth, Weber told a reporter:
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>“I merely held up the mirror of truth that humanity might see
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>life.”23 Of her film Scandal (1915) she said: “I trust that this play
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>will act as a most powerful sermon and will accomplish much last
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ing good wherever shown.”24
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Although Weber’s use of film to teach the masses proper moral
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>behavior can be seen as Victorian, many of her films were criticized
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and censored. Her frustration with Victorian prudishness and the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>lack of respect given to films as an art is revealed in her “modern
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and progressive response to censorship:
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Don’t let the people have what they want,” is as pernicious a
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>cry as its converse “Give the people what they want.” Both are
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>parrotlike catch-words of limited meaning. “The people” have
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>always been reactionary in their ideas, and have fought progress
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>in all its forms consistently. If “the people” alone were consult-

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>weaving our own clothes, and growing and killing our own
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>food. That is the stage to which censorship would like to rele

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>atypical, she still held traditional values and beliefs, particularly
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>about marriage. True to the Victorian code, which drew a solid
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>line between love and passion,26 Weber told a reporter:
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>We are all too apt to confuse happiness with passion. Love is
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>constant hunger—friendship alone brings happiness of lasting

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The Columbus Dispatch cited the Smalleys as “one of the most
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>illuminating examples of marital happiness.”28 After praising
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Weber’s work, the Ohio State Journal was sure to mention that
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;she and Mr. Smalley have been congenial co-workers,” and the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Motion Picture Story Magazine called Phillips Smalley her
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“chum.”29In an interview published in a syndicated column, which
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>reached thousands of readers, Weber was asked if she believed in
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the possibility of a happy marriage. “She said she most emphati
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cally did believe in the happy American household.” The inter
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>viewer then asked what was the one necessity for a happy mar
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>riage. “There is only one, she said, Friendship.... The success
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ful marriage should be composed of nine tenths friendship and one
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tenth physical attraction. For then when the physical glamour goes

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>course.””3° While publicists recorded Weber’s “prescription,” they
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>somehow failed to describe her full “reality”—not until the end of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>her career did it become widely known that she and Smalley had
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>divorced in 1923.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Marriage was in fact the predominant theme in many of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Weber’s films. Like Most Wives (1914), The Hand That Rocks the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Cradle (1917), and What Do Men Want? (1921) are Victorian in
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>their preoccupation with the themes of marriage and morality, but
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they do not idealize marriage. Instead, they acknowledge the inter-
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>play of romantic love, economic factors, and class divisions in the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>selection of a spouse and the success or failure of the marriage
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>itself. In some films, like A Cigarette, That’s All (1915), a flaw in
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the wife’s morality is the cause of a failed marriage; others, such as
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Hypocrites, subtly criticize the hypocritical Victorian view of a
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>woman’s innate morality and passivity (although the woman was
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>seen as morally superior, as a wife her fate was determined by her
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>husband’s immorality). In many of the didactic films of the silent
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>era, “marital incompatibility and maladjustment (were) rarely
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>hinted at and the unquestioned purpose of wedlock was Progeni-
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ture.”31 Yet Weber’s films, although often moralistic, did explore

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>values. Marriage as cinematic theme and as biographical reality
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>for Weber is one aspect of the tension between who Lois Weber
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>was, what she believed, and how she was projected to the public.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Weber’s ideas straddled two worlds, preserving one while illumi
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>nating the reality and possibilities of the other. In the process she
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>often adapted traditional attitudes to fit new realities.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>During the time of Weber’s career the lives of women and men
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>were undergoing transformation and redefinition in a modernized
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>American society. Although basic Victorian tenets such as in
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>equality in marriage remained intact for many, the ideology of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Victorian womanhood was challenged by the undeniable appear-
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ance of women who did not fit into the Victorian norm—women
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>who worked outside of the home and pursued new activities during
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>their leisure time. Rather than a radical break from Victorian per-

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>such problems simply do not exist. I went

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>participate in that movement because it
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>makes me feel marginalized. I identify
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>much more strongly with the kind of vitali

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>able to see her occasionally. There was a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>two-month period, when the war in Nica-
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ragua was at its fiercest, when no one had
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>any news of me. Only after Somoza was

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>because she sees me doing exactly the same
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>kind of things her father does. But family

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I had the opportunity to do the editing here

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Back in Peru, I was immediately con

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>time, and I became very involved, sitting

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>looking back now, this was one of our mis

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N003'/>toward “new” uses of narrative by avant-garde independent film-

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>Much feminist study has been devoted to the development of a

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N012'/>films, these are just a few aspects of narrative cinema that are
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N013'/>called into question. With only a few exceptions,2 however, little
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N014'/>attention has been given to the possibility of a radical feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N015'/>experimental film—one that breaks from the use of narrative
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>altogether.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N017'/>Writings on narrative films maintain that dominant cinema
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N018'/>must be criticized from within (through further narrative work) in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N019'/>order to undermine its politically repressive impact. In light of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N020'/>recent work on narrative it is evident that this results in a deeper
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N021'/>investment in the very principles that are ostensibly being sub

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N027'/>New narrative filmmakers do acknowledge this “obvious” relation
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N028'/>as an ideological construct. Nevertheless, they fall back on a provi

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N030'/>need for the particular pleasure provided by narrative has been
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N031'/>overemphasized to the point of forcing an equation between narra-
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N032'/>tive and pleasure, and, by implication, non-narrative and non
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N033'/>pleasure. This equation fails to acknowledge other less obvious

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N037'/>political credence and authority, narrative takes on the appearance

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N051'/>Proponents of the new narrative argue that if a film departs too
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N052'/>radically from familiar narrative elements, the audience will
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N053'/>decrease and the film will be consigned to obscurity, limiting its
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N054'/>potential for large-scale political effectiveness. It is assumed that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N055'/>the most effective means to undermine mainstream cinema is to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N056'/>preserve selected narrative elements, within which departures can
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N057'/>be made. The idea is that one elicits a set of accustomed formal
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N058'/>viewing expectations, all the better to shatter them.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N066'/>between these intentions and the actual films.

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>len is indicative of this trend toward greater accessibility—and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>toward a classical use of film. Laura Mulvey has stated:
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>...we see each film we make as potentially reaching a wider
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>audience than the one before....I don’t feel that AMY! breaks
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>new ground in the way that Riddles sof the Sphinx) did. But at
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the same time it&apos;s more accessible and consumable, and in that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sense it could appeal to a wider group of people.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The first Mulvey/Wollen feature, Penthesilea (1975), attempts to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>replace the structuring device of narrative with theoretical and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>historical text. The film is divided into four formally different
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sequences, addressing the Amazon legend and women’s place in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>patriarchal language. Their second feature, Riddles of the Sphinx
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>(1977), again reflects feminist concerns, highlighting the issue of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women’s place in language from the position of the mother. This
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>film, too, is structured by formally distinct sequences. Each
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sequence, however, is a narrative within itself, providing the basic
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>framework of a diegesis, character development (however limited),
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>temporal continuity, etc. AMY! (1980) provides an even less altered
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>version of narrative, offering a feminist rendering of the story of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>aviator Amy Johnson. The film’s linearity is broken only intermit
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>tently by short interludes such as a poetic stop-action bird-in-flight
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sequence, or a mapping sequence. Crystal Gazing (1982), their
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fourth feature, is a narrative film in the strict sense. Its avant
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>garde function can be read only in the content “side” of the film:
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>It is about “surviving in London in the 80’s,”4 and deals with the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>issues of Thatcherism and rock-n-roll. Interestingly, this classical
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>narrative is also the first of their films that does not focus on the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>central issue of patriarchy, but instead pictures the present rela
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tions of capital in London. With British Film Institute funding of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>S140,000, its rendering of a desperate political climate brings into
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>question their own position within that climate.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The issue of economic survival is of paramount importance,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and the move to narrative reflects this concern. As funds for film
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>making become scarce, it becomes increasingly difficult and risky
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to depend on granting systems for support. Much current work is
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>done with a view toward marketing potential: Larger budgets,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>better” production values, and more topical themes all signal the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>move toward making films that are commercially viable products
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>—lifted from obscurity to greater “public acceptance, from small
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>film-screening spaces to art-movie houses, a step away from com
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>mercial houses—and, by design or default, a shift from a concern
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>for the possibilities of new uses of film to a concern for marketa
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>bility and accessibility. These “formally accessible” films require
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the sophisticated tools of mainstream cinema to effect the degree
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>of illusion necessary to be read familiarly. This shift toward a use
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of expensive, accessible form for political content is apparent in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the Mulvey/Wollen films. One also sees it in Sally Potter’s move
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>from the relatively low-budget Thriller (1979) to her epic drama

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>True, one might conclude from this upward mobility of the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>“avant-garde” that, finally, new avant-garde filmwork is being
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>acknowledged with funds. But a more accurate reading might be
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>that the avant-garde is formulating its own “new” Hollywood
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>through private and government money. This situation is neither
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>new nor advanced.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>limit of intelligibility within a film, beyond which it will be too
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>obscure to sustain people’s interest. And this fallacy often goes

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>such unequivocal trust, the filmmakers assume a position of omni

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>power of the image, voiceover narration literally speaks ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>developed out of Marxism, psychoanalysis, and semiotics. Con
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>stance Penley has stated: “Images have very little power in them-
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>selves; their power of fascination and identification is too strong.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>That is why there must always be a commentary on the image
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>simultaneously of and with them. 6
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The work of Jean-Luc Godard has been a source of inspiration
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>for many filmmakers who employ this strategy. A case in point is
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>his film Le Gai Savoir (1968), in which media images, acted
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sequences, documentary-style sequences, and political theorizing/
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>poeticizing are intercut and overlapped in a dense intertextual
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>montage. Spoken/written language is intended as commentary on
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and analysis of the ideology manifested in the images. The inclu
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sion of a multiplicity of elements purportedly provides a prime
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>situation for a more dialectical viewing: The greater the amount of
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>elements placed before us, the greater the number of juxtapositions
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of meanings can occur. Knowledge of Godard’s intentions for a
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>more dialectical viewing situation, however, fails to effect that
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>experience. In watching the film we are provided with a complicat-

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>between image and image, image and sound, sound and sound.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>But this presentation never addresses the complex dialectical rela-

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sentation within and through images.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Yvonne Rainer’s Journeys from Berlin (1979) also provides a

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>principle of transparency that is at work in mainstream films:
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>Traditional narrative is based on the rule that all elements
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>should combine to form a unity, that each element should have

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>its proper, intelligible place in the text and that an ending be

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>all would be an untimely one indeed. The new narrative ignores
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>this rule. Opacity, quotations from all sorts of sources without
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>stating what their relevance might be, and the fluctuating sta-
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tus of sequences as fiction or non-fiction are evidences of this.8
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Opacity indicates self-consciousness on the part of the filmmaker,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>thus foregrounding his/her presence within the work. It also indi
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cates the presence of critical/theoretical work:
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Opacity often leads the viewer to assume the presence of theo
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>retical groundwork and therefore to look for it, and it also
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>signals an inexhaustibility to the work, an idea that it needs
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>repeated screenings to be understood to any degree. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sense of opacity often remains even after the theory has been
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>understood. This grows out of a general toleration these films
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>have for loose ends; and the general opposition to the notion
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that every element of a text should be accounted for by the text.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The opacity is, in many cases, no more than the impossibility of
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>accounting for some of its elements.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The writers go on to imply that the theoretical underpinnings of a

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>elements of the story were omitted, disrupting the customary

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that leads the viewer to wonder about—and search for—the miss
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ing parts. One wonders whether “opacity” here isn’t being used
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>synonymously with “obscurity” and “inscrutability”—which would,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in the end, leave the viewer in the same relation to the film as
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>would a Hollywood noir film wherein some key moments in the
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>drama were arbitrarily omitted. The authors go on to say:
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>... opacity can become a reassuring quality for the viewer, con
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>vincing her or him that everything is, after all, in its proper

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>anisms that are not fully apparent to the audience. Opacity
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>gives one the idea that theory is behind the film, clear to the
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>filmmakers, and that therefore everything in the work is moti
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>vated, and that it is worthy of trust. And this, in turn, justifies
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the opacity. A neat circle of opacity, motivation, trustworthi-
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ness, justification, acceptance, and again opacity.1
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>It seems ironic that a theory intended originally to prescribe an

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ing of motivation and the process of viewing itself, should now be
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>called upon to produce a very different effect: trust, unequivocal
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>acceptance of what is presented because the filmmaker “knows
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>what he/she is doing, and, ultimately, yet another case of invest-

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>The inscription of theory in many of the new narratives makes
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>a certain kind of analysis not only possible, but necessary. The
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>confusion between the problems specific to film theory/analysis
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>and film practice has led to a use of literary analysis as a primary
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>mode of film viewing. The success of the film is measured by how
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>well it illustrates a particular issue, which can then be subjected to
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>analysis. In turn a particular theoretical take is required to under
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>stand the film, and a particular theoretical background is presup
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>posed. Reading a film as an illustration of literary ideas has come
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>to be regarded not only as a possible means for knowledge of a
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>certain kind in certain films, but as the means, par excellence, for
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>certain knowledge in/of all film work.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>In this scheme, the filmmaker and the critic/theorist have
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>entered into a curious symbiotic relationship, in which the film

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>earth. Many recent narrative films function as setups for critical
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>analysis: Theoretical discourse becomes the subtext of the film,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>which becomes a sitting duck for the critic, whose reading was pre
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pared beforehand. Films that play on such a symbiotic relation
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ship seem to suggest that nothing new can be done in film—that
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the best a contemporary filmmaker can do is to repeat endless
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>variations of old forms.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>In the absence of characters with whom to identify, the sophis

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>knowledge, within theory. The dramaturgy of traditional narrative
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>has simply been supplanted by a grammaturgy of theoretical prin
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ciples. The traditional story has been replaced by a larger story-
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>theory. The “story” becomes even grander when the psyche of the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>filmmaker is brought into the picture as a subject to be analyzec
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>conjointly with the film. The theory of psychoanalysis is used as a
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>cover, merging the respective narratives of the filmmaker’s psyche
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and the film itself into an aggregate “case history.&apos;

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Another strategy that is supposed to challenge traditional nar-
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>rative codes is that of thwarting character development. The depic
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tion of human beings with elusive identities allegedly serves to
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>subvert empathy and identification between the viewer and the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>protagonist.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The device of the “shifting signifier” is commonly employed in
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>new narrative films. Yvonne Rainer’s Film About a Woman
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Who... (1974) and Kristina Talking Pictures (1976) are two early
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>films which experiment with this device as a strategy for breaking
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the power of character identification. Gordon’s Empty Suitcases is
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>a later use of this device in which the pronoun “she” is used, in
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>voiceover narration and intertitles, to refer to a number of different
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>female protagonists, all of whom appear on the screen at different
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>times and in different settings. Since no cohesive story is built
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>around a central protagonist, an ambiguity develops in regard to
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the identity of “she” at any given point in the film. The female
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>characters thus become interchangeable with one another.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Instead of the highly developed characters presented by main
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>stream cinema, we now have an assortment of appearances, sem
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>blances and archetypes. What takes place is a “shattering” of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>character in which each fragment carries the earmarks of the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>whole that engendered it.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>The use of the archetype claims to bring about an awareness of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the archetypal nature not only of the characters within the par
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ticular film, but also, by implication, of all filmic depiction of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>human behavior. As a reducèd model, the archetype supposedly
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>facilitates the process of analysis and dissection for the viewer.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Identification is no longer elicited through empathy with a char
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>acter undergoing conflict, but through the vicarious experience of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>style. Instead of a real break with unity of character, we are left
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>with a multiplicity of reduced archetypes, with “whom” we can
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>still identify, albeit in a more ambiguous way. But ambiguous
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>processes of identification still remain processes of identification.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>From whence the supposition that analysis precludes seduction?
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Laura Mulvey’s article “Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cine
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ma”12 advanced feminist film study by proposing a political use of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>psychoanalysis in the study of mainstream narrative cinema. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>not a prescriptive theory for film practice.13 Her emphasis is on the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>use of psychoanalysis to reveal and dismantle the workings of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>patriarchy within narrative cinema, especially in regard to repre
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>sentations of women in subservience to the male gaze.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Gordon’s Empty Suitcases and Jackie Raynal’s Deux Fois
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>(1970) have been cited as films that address this problem. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>case of Raynal, the filmmaker turns the camera on herself, at
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>times defiantly staring into the camera—at once the object and the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>subject of her own gaze, at once “male” and “female.” This simul
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>taneous engagement with and critical/analytical relation to her
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>own image is intended to promote the viewer’s awareness of—and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>therefore rupture with—the problematic seductive nature of the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>image. Yet a picture of a seductive woman “tells” us nothing about
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>the nature of pictures, seduction, or women. Without prior knowl-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>edge of the theory behind this sequence, it is doubtful whether one
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>will read it as against seduction. If anything, the “male” nature of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the gaze is reinforced by such a strategy. Analysis, bearing no
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>relation to the film itself, is what prevents this scene from function
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing as it would in any mainstream film.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The interruption or disjunction of the narrative line is yet
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>another strategy employed to undermine the viewer’s engagement.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>This tactic is evident in the fractured narratives of such films as
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Empty Suitcases which, rather than breaking with narrative, pro
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>vides multiple, limited narrative developments in an endless defer-
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ral of completion. This process is intended to unfix meaning,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>opening up multiple readings and disengaging the viewer from the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>drive for completion, yet providing enough narrative satisfaction.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>But how long can a story continue before something takes place;
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>before some specific meaning is produced? This strategy assumes
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a calibrated model of narrative, in which the viewer’s engagement
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>(and subsequent fixing of meaning) occurs only at certain intervals.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The filmmaker functions as manipulator, intermittently leading
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>on and closing off the viewer. This kind of withdrawal tactic
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>assumes that the only moment when “something” takes place is at
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the instance of climax—a dangerously mistaken assumption. The
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>comparatively straightforward appeal of mainstream narrative has
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>taken on a coy seductiveness in these altered versions, veiling the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>operations of narrative in a game of hard-to-get. Complication is

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The very concept of diegesis presupposes that a separation can
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>be made between a kind of para-reality and what are obviously
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>nonrealistic materials, all within the same experience of watching
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the same film. This model fails to account for the fact that a film
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>establishes its own terms, its own context. What is constructed,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>therefore, sets the terms of its own reality as film. Everything that
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>takes place within a particular film is by definition “diegetic”—it
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>belongs to a particular framework which may be modeled in the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>image of the everyday world but which nonetheless becomes some
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>thing different, on the level of experience, once it is placed within
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the film-viewing context. There is a fundamental misunderstand
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ing about the nature of film in the very designation of diegetic and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>nondiegetic elements. “Blurring” a nondistinction seems absurd.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>As far as non-narrative filmmakers are concerned, the only non
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>diegetic moment occurs when the film stops, and the film-viewing
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>experience is over.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>The idea of “blurring distinctions” forms the cornerstone for
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>discussion of recent developments in narrative film. Diegesis/non
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>diegesis, fiction/nonfiction, form/content, personal/political,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>objective/subjective—how did these elements gain the stability as
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>fixed categories to be expressed as pairs of opposites, and then to
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>be posited as “blurred distinctions”? To accept such distinctions
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>as more than what they are (terms of convenience), one must first
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>accept narrative convention as the very foundation of all film prac

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>The case for narrative film is based on the belief that a film

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>practice of non-narrative feminist experimental film is not only
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>possible, but already exists. From the experimental work of Ger

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Rhodes in England, it is evident that feminist non-narrative exper
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>imental film can be made.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>As with any other area, experimental film is not without its own
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>specific problems, which need to be addressed within the terms of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>feminism. A fratriarchy of experimental film has developed with
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>its own standards of “quality” to protect, with an absolute faith in
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>certain principles and ideals, which themselves mirror patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ideology. The North American structural film movement, for
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>example, took the ideal of a positivist science as its starting point,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and the work of Michael Snow, Hollis Frampton, George Landow,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and others relies heavily on the aims and methods of that discipline.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>In these films it is evident that the answer being sought, the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>object of the experiment, is inscribed in the very questions asked:
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The “knowledge” to be gained is determined in advance. The very
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>terms of this film practice, the set of rules that govern it, delineate
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and restrict the area of inquiry, and thereby foreclose the possibility
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of any result that was not already known from the outset of the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>process. The ideal of pure Science, applied to film, provides no
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>guarantee of freedom from the ideology inscribed within the very
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>materials of film. On the contrary, it reflects the patriarchal ideol
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ogy from which it originated, and which it continues to serve.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Another development, the “lyrical” or “visionary” film (i.e.,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Stan Brakhage), posits a world in which an entirely new set of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>physical and social principles is in operation. In a pseudo-naif
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>search for a more “pure” vision, a return to an unadulterated
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>mode of seeing, visionary filmmakers exempt themselves from
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the responsibility of examining and challenging the very myths and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ideals of an ideology which they buy into in their use of the tools of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cinema.

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the last word—the ultimate strategy—in a long history of attempts

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ness implicit in the very act of assertion. The nature of experi

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>work needs to proceed in a manner that assumes no ultimate end,

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>itself. By proposing a feminist film practice, we are necessarily

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>This reflects the desire not to reproduce already-existing represen-

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the impossibility of its main task: to represent. We wish to finally
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>acknowledge this impossibility and to move on to a use of film that
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>attempts no mastery of meaning, assumes no ultimate knowledge
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of reality through film. For film will fail to advance any under

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>make a living as filmmakers. Many make

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Because there is limited interest from
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the public, what money there is (usually
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>earned through a full-time job) has to be
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>used expertly. Many hats have to be worn
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>by these filmmakers, including budgetinz
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the money once it is raised. But the re

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>than divine. The marital relationship of

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The divine is privatized as romantic love,

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>man outside. A similar division of work is
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>apparent in the office, between the hus

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>are established as financially dependent,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and their work is primarily concerned with

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>carefully stored in a jar in the kitchen. The
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>wife refuses to service the husband. The
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>marriage bargain is broken and the humor
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>in the film asserts itself, as a new “legal
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>agreement” must be arranged. Only now
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>can the wife reclaim her identity and in

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>own name (albeit her name by marriage).

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>this energy was rapidly dissipated by the

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>achieved was undermined. Her husband,

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>simply described by a reviewer sixty years
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>later: “Madame Beudet is married to a

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>plot, the film’s intensity—its visual impact
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and depth of feeling—is achieved through

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>political reasons for choosing the forms and subjects in your work?
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>DS: In 1969 I got introduced to the peace movement, the New
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Left, and the women’s movement in rapid succession. It was a
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>pretty heady year. I also got introduced to alternative filmmaking
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>at the same time. Until that time all I knew from films was Satur
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>day afternoon. I met a group of people in an organization called
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Newsreel, which was making and distributing political and social
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>documentaries—mostly anti-war films but also films about other
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>movements, things that were happening on campuses and in com
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>munities around the country. So my interest in film was initially
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>political, in film as an organizing tool. But without the women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>movement, I don’t think I ever would have become a filmmaker.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>There were just beginning to be opportunities for women in film
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>making, and at Newsreel there was a mini-revolution to train the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>women. We learned quickly, and that really opened doors to my
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>career in film.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>After leaving Newsreel I formed a company called Pandora
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Films with other women I knew at Newsreel. We made two films-
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>one on sex education called How about You, a half-hour black and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>white film for high school students. Then we made a film called
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Chris and Bernie, about two single mothers, divorced women try
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ing to cope with their children and develop their careers.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>After that I felt somewhat ghetto-ized in two respects: I was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>making short documentaries that were very limited in terms of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>available distribution, and I felt confined to women’s issues. I
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>think it’s very important that women filmmakers are now taking
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>on a whole range of subjects rather than being confined to “purely
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>women’s themes.” That could be a dangerous tendency, particu
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>larly in the bigger film industry, where women are hired only when
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>it’s a “women’s subject.” It’s real gratifying to me that at First-
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Run Features [which commercially distributes independently pro
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>duced films) we have films directed by women on a range of sub-
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>jects. Still, I think it’s important that women continue to make
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>films that are primarily of interest to women, on issues that other
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>people aren’t going to deal with in the way we can.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Now l’m co-producing a film on DES for the PBS “Matters of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Life and Death” series, and l’m researching a film on immigrants,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>on undocumented workers in the urban Northeast. The most re
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>cent film I did was called The Wobblies, an hour and a half docu-
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>mentary about a labor union at the turn of the century. It intrigued
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>me because women played a key role in it, and it was the first
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>union that tried to organize women.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>CC: I know Deborah because we were in the same organization
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>many years ago—lots of fights and disagreements. Ironically, Deb
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>orah’s consciousness was raised because the film industry is prett
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>much white male-dominated, technically and in terms of who’s
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>directing. It’s a microcosm of our society as a whole. So at News-
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>reel, women got together and demanded that the organization dea
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>with what would enhance our directing, our point of view.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>My situation is a bit different because I am not only a woman
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>but a national minority. When I joined Newsreel in 1971, I saw
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>white people making films about Blacks and Hispanics, for in
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>stance. And I felt there was a lack of depth in the representation of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>how minorities really feel in this country. A few of us began to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>recognize that to deal with issues affecting our community (Third
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>World communities), it would be better to take our demands fur-
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>ther and to take control of the whole process. That’s when I seri
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>ously began to engage in filmmaking.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>I got into filmmaking for subjective as well as objective reasons.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>Subjectively, I felt that as an immigrant coming to this country,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>encountered a lot of issues and experiences which I wasn’t able to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>verbalize or articulate. Filmmaking in some way seemed non
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>verbal, although today I realize it’s very verbal—not only writing
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>proposals 100 pages long but also dealing with all the corporations,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>etc. Anyway, I needed to express these experiences from my point
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>of view. Minority women encounter different kinds of pressure
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>within the society: economic, social, and cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>Secondly, an objective reason or need I felt at that time (the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>early ’70s) was that minority women needed to be able to work with
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>the overall women’s movement—but the movement never really
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>got into race or class. I started to realize that racism and class
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>issues are inseparable from other issues. They need to be ad
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>dressed, and not only from the side of the white American. I
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>thought it was about time to bring up the minorities’ point of view,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>to make it more balanced. l’m using the term “minority” quanti
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>tatively, since people of color all over the world are a much larger
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>population. I’m talking qualitatively in terms of rights in this
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>country.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>I also felt this need to get into filmmaking to express some of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>the needs and experiences of Asian-American sisters in this coun
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>try. In television and the mass media, you rarely see any Asian
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>American announcers. Generally Asian-American women are de
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>picted as sexy stereotypes, and in return most are very shy in front
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>of the camera. They don’t feel they can present anything important
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>or contribute anything to the overall American culture or history.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>So I felt it was my own responsibility to present our contribution to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>America. Recently the New York Times printed it very clearly
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>One out of four persons in New York City is foreign-born; 50% are
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>minorities. But look at Channel 13, PBS programming. It hardly
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>deals with that sector of the population. Obviously that comes
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>down to the dollar question.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>Unfortunately, although you want to present women’s issues
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>and minority issues and Asian-American issues, somehow you
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>gradually get forced into this confined area—that’s the only area
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>people recognize you can do. Once, I wanted to do something on
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>the automation-cybernation of industry; nobody wanted to give me
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>a cent. That’s an institutionalization of racism and sexism.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>And how are we going to be able to counteract that? I think I
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>can’t do it myself, as an individual. I need the voices, for example,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>of other people who work within institutions who are able to see
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>that confinement as a way of perpetuating the same stereotypes,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>but in a much more sophisticated and institutionalized manner.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>I am working on a piece right now called Delta Mississippi
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>Chinese Between Blacks and Whites, a 90-minute documentary
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N055'/>with dramatic elements. l’m influenced by Italian neo-realism—
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N056'/>using a particular situation very far removed from your personal
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N057'/>reality but depicting a larger universal phenomenon. In this case,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N058'/>it’s the Chinese caught like a middle-man minority between white
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N059'/>planters and Black slaves. It’s a system basically built for two in
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N060'/>the South. When the third element comes in, what kind of change
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N061'/>takes place? In some ways this film is a very subjective translation
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N062'/>of the Mississippi situation because, as an immigrant, l’ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N063'/>influenced culturally and historically by both white and Black
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_65' n='N064'/>Americans. The majority of the Chinese tend to recognize the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_66' n='N065'/>credibility of white America, and they deny that they have had any
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_67' n='N066'/>kind of influence from other minorities... and I think l’ve figured

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>perpetuate it against other minorities. So it appears that I am very
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>critical of my own people sometimes. I mean I would never be who
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I am today without the civil rights movement, without a Black
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>struggle, without a women’s movement in the early ”70s. Many of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>us filmmakers tend to forget others who have paved the road be
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>fore us. Without that kind of struggle, I would never be able to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>make films today. And filmmaking is a way to try to eliminate the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>racism in this country.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>MK: I make videotapes. I started out as a visual artist and did a
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>work on Jean Seberg and the Freedom of Information Act. I got
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her file from the FBI after she died and I made a tape about her,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>her file, and her media life. Also, I just finished editing a videotape
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>which is a documentary of a street festival called “No More Witch-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>hunts.” The festival was held to protest neo-McCarthyism and took
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>place right out here on Astor Place on June 19, 1981.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>What l’m working on now is a tape called Progress (Memory
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>about the evolution of communications, technology, and national
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>security. Basically l’m interested in access to and freedom of infor
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>mation. I noticed in the New York Times today that the Reagan
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Administration is cutting back on the collection of statistics
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that’s health statistics and all kinds—that affect OSHA. They’re
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>eliminating hundreds of government publications or charging
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>large sums of money for them and reducing the staff of the Nation-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>al Archives, making less historical material available. All that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>serves to reduce the freedom of information in the U.S.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The tape l’m making about progress and memory looks at what
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>makes up the legitimacy of democratic government in the United
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>States. The idea of industrial progress and technological progress
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>has always been married to social progress, generally speaking.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>The tape looks at how the military has replaced social progress
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>with technology in the equation that defines the legitimacy of gov-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ernment. National security has become a kind of password. Securi
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ty and protection have replaced social benefits and social welfare.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The tape looks at how communications are increasingly designed
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>for the military, for technological advancement and transnational
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>exchange. It examines how crucial information is to our existence,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>individually and as a democracy, and how there’s no access to it.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The problem is really tremendous and growing in the United
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>States because multinational private corporations have control
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>over communications systems. Although in my work I have been
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>concerned with government, there is a way people may have access
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to government by trying to get things declassified. But nobody has
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>any access to private corporations. They control the privacy of their
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>information because they have First Amendment rights. This has
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to be worked out: That is, how can we regulate private enterprise
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>so it’s not monopolizing communications throughout the world?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>HC: What I thought was fascinating about your Seberg tape—I
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>saw it at the Museum of Modern Art—was the way it was installed,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>having to look at the tape through the FBI files and the New York
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Times articles.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>MK: Right, I don’t only make tapes; I build installations with
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>them. That’s the art part left over from being an artist, I guess.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>The tapes can exist by themselves and they also collaborate with
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the materials in the installations. It’s a way to get people to experi
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ence by just walking through something. I grew up in Coney Island
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and the thing that really fascinated me was going to these horror
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>houses. I think my installations are a remnant of being affected in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>that way. As you walk through, something reaches out to you, like
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>a furry, hairy hand, so that you feel scared or threatened or cajoled.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>But I am really concerned with just one subject—freedom of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>information. I came to this because I was working for the State
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Department, taking around an art exhibition in Eastern Europe
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>and it was a routine kind of thing to be under surveillance by their
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>government. It was a horrifying experience. And the artists I met
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>there were so eager to exercise the kinds of rights that we have in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>America, rights that artists never exercise much in their work here,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>that I just wanted to focus on this.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>I am trying to convince people to make a bridge between some
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>thing intellectual and the more emotional place where we live.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>DM: I also came to filmmaking from art. I was a graphic artist,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>not a fine artist, designing posters, publicity, and sets—mostly in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>theaters in South Africa. I was working in theaters outside of the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mainstream like community theaters that were multiracial. Then I
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>became involved in literacy campaigns and health education work-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>shops, and got involved in film by looking for a suitable medium
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for whatever program we were doing.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I became interested in the history of the women’s movement in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>South Africa, which was hardly documented and which very few
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>people knew about. In fact there was an enormous women’s move-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ment in the ’5Os in South Africa, made up mainly of the women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>movement of the ANC, a Black organization, although the Indian
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Women’s League, the Colored Women’s Congress League, and
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Democrats, a white women’s league, were active as well. All that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was a history which had been completely ignored by both the Left
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and the Right in South Africa.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>A friend of mine and I decided to make a documentary film on
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that movement. So I dove in the deep end, not really knowing
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>much about film at all, and managed to persuade people to fund
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>it. I think it was purely because people were taken by the idea. It’s
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>quite amazing that anyone gave us any money considering l’d no
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>experience.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>At the moment I am working on another film on South Africa
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>which is based on a play done in New York, mainly by Black South
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Africans. It looks at a South African woman’s life, a Black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>who’s a domestic. It’s called The LongJourney of Poppie Nongena,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and was written originally as a novel by an Afrikaans woman called
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Elsa Sheber. It’s quite extraordinary because it deals with the facts
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of a woman’s life in a lot of detail, and gives a side of Black peo
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ple’s lives in South Africa which hasn’t been touched or explored
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>before. l’m making a documentary around the theater production,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>because the play deals with the actors’ lives or the lives their
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>mothers led. So it’s a reflection of their own lives. There are points
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>where reality and performance become blurred and art and politics
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>also become blurred. I hope to get across this kind of information
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>in a way that will appeal to a much broader audience than, for
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>example, a political documentary on South Africa.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>MN: How did you come to this country?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>DM: It was when we finished shooting the footage for the other
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>film called You Have Struck a Rock—the title’s actually from a
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>song made up for a big demonstration: “You have touched a wom
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>an, You have struck a rock, You will be crushed.” As we were
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>shooting, security men followed us and we were scared of being
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>caught and having the film confiscated. So every day we’d ship the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>film out through a contact I had. There was a choice of either
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>cutting the film in London or cutting it here, so I decided to cut it
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>here.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The film deals with a period of history in which the women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>contribution has certainly been neglected. So many times these
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>young kids would come out of these screenings and say, “We never
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>knew we had that kind of history; we never knew this about our
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>grandmothers.” That’s been incredibly important. In some way
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the film broke a barrier about women getting involved in some of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the organizing and political activities; it seemed to break the ice
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and established some kind of credibility. Even if it never had any
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>other kind of success, that is really important.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>DS: Does it affect you being a white Zimbabwean making films on
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Black Africans?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>DM: l’ve always worked in mixed groups. I think one of the most
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>pressing needs of filmmaking in Zimbabwe and South Africa is
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>that it’s nearly all white people who have the technical skills. Most

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>ferent, but it still has so many elements of everybody else’s. During
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>the civil rights and women’s movement that everybody’s spoken of,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>I was 13 years old, in a very small hicktown in a remote part of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>India. I didn’t quite know all this was happening in the rest of the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>world. It was a very protected life, very much like what Chris
			</p>
			<pb n='72'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>described as a life “being colonized by the colonizer.” My father
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>worked for the relics of the British Raj, and although we’re very
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Indian, we were quite obsessed with what the British had left be
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>hind. It did seem odd that I spoke English better than all the other
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Indian languages that I knew. I always felt that I wanted some-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>thing different, and this eventually led me to join a theater which
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was begun by a number of Indian students. Of course, we only had
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>English plays to perform. What theater did for me in India was to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>give me a sense of great independence, without the traditional bag-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gage of being an Indian woman, being submissive and the rest of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>it. This independence got me to Boston, where I studied as an
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>undergraduate. Then I stumbled into filmmaking.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>My feelings of being a guest in so many worlds led me to make
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>my most recent film, So Far from India. When I started I had a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>voice and I had a vision, but I didn’t quite know the language and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>elements to use to tell the story. So I did what I saw many docu-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>mentarians around me doing—picked a subject and researched it.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Gradually the subject changed by itself. I met 150 Indians living in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>New York, and picked this man who was working in a subway
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>newsstand, and inherited his story. We followed him in quite a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>traditional documentary style. It came out that two weeks before
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>he left India—in a very mythical, old-fashioned way, to seek his
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fortune in America—he was married off by his family to a village
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>girl in order that he not marry a foreigner here. I didn’t know this
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>when I first met him; over six months of filming we gradually
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>unraveled the story. The woman became pregnant after two weeks
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of being married to him and she had a son in India. He was deter
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>mined to go back to India to see his son. By that time we had
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>gotten so close to him and he had gotten so used to us, the crew,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that we decided to follow him. We also happened to get a grant at
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the right minute. So we went to India and inherited the story of his
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>family and the story of his wife, who emerged as à very strong
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>character. The film is not just about a husband who leaves his wife
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>behind but also about the position of a woman without a husband,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>because a husband in that community literally defines your pres
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ence or your absence.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>I really feel what Deborah was saying about being locked into
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>one area. I mean, a feminist is something I surely consider myself,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>but I don’t describe myself as that right off the bat. So I hesitate
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I don’t want this film to be described as a “woman’s film,” though
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>it has very much to do with women and men and what makes us
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>what we are.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>I find myself very intrigued and excited by the documentary
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>forms, but l’m finding that this need to tell stories is propelling me
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>more toward dramatic film. I want more control, but l’m still
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>interested in the neo-realism which puts drama in a context which
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>is very authentic. My next project—the one that’s in my head right
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>now—has to do with mail-order brides. Immigrants, Indians, are
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>very, very careful about maintaining their purity in terms of their
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>caste or community. The whole milieu determines that you marry
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>someone who will keep this milieu going. This is very common; it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>not an amazing phenomenon even in America right now. The story
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>is about a woman who is raised—not in the poor and exotic part of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>India that we all know here in America—but in something that is a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>mix of all these colonial and Indian backgrounds—middle-class
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>India. So this woman, who in the eyes of middle-class Indians is a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>&quot;“liberated” woman, is placed in an arranged marriage, leaves her
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>country not just to a strange country but also to a strange man,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>who has been programmed to expect a certain kind of woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>And she has to conform.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>MC: Well, my background is really different, and in a way I also
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>feel slightly strange, being on this panel, because l’m not really a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>documentary filmmaker, even though l’ve made one documentary.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>I started getting interested in film when I was in graduate school in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>cognitive psychology. At the same time my political consciousness
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>got turned around. I was in Madison in the very late 1960s and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>early ’70s, and was very affected by what was going on there with
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>the New Left and the women’s movement, and somehow saw film
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>as a way to articulate what I was feeling.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>When I started making films I had a strong notion—this is
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>simplistically stated—new forms for new contents. What it meant
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>was that I made a lot of films that were formally experimental and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>were about women’s issues. I realize now that was because I come
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>from a working-class/lower-middle-class background and there
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was a part of me that was relentlessly culturally upwardly mobile. I
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>somehow associated experimental films with art, with something
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>better than mere documentary. And so I would make these experi
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>mental films and show them around to women, and they would be
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>totally uninterested in what was going on; there was absolutely no
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>communication. It forced me to reevaluate what I was doing. At
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that point I did make a documentary film called Parthenogenesis,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>about a woman musician who was a classical violinist in Boston,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and her student, my sister. But I felt very limited with documentary.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Since then, l’ve been making films that are clearly hybrids. My
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>last film was Daughter Rite, about mothers and daughters. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>a hybrid in that the narrative portions were shot to look like docu
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mentary, like cinema verité. The literal documentary portions of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the film—home movies taken of my mother, my sister, and myself
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>by my father—were optically printed in an experimental film way,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and the entire film was a narrative. It was successful in that it was
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>not a traditional narrative, not a traditional documentary, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>was accessible to people who had no experience in any kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>avant-garde film. I was able to communicate with slightly new
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>forms to women who didn’t have any experience with those forms
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>at all.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The film l’m working on now—What You Takefor Granted...,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>which is feature-length—is about women and work. It’s about
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>token women, women who are very isolated in nontraditional jobs,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>blue-collar and professional jobs. The film is about the difference
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>between blue-collar work and professional work in our culture,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and the contradictions for women in those positions—psychologi
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>cally, historically, politically, socially. And once again, it’s a hybrid.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The film consists of six women who talk about their experiences in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>a talking-heads format. Then two of the women, a doctor and a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>truck driver, meet through a contrivance, and there’s a narrative
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>spin-off. The film alternates between narrative and the talking
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>heads, all of which are acted. The whole film places the two women
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and the narrative in a broader historical context. And it also tries
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>to play off between public and private more than a traditional nar
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>rative would. I feel documentary film is very good at presenting the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>public sphere, which has been extremely important for women, but
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>is not necessarily good at presenting the private sphere. I think
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that the intersection between the public and the private—who we
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>are publicly and how we present ourselves publicly as opposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>who we might be privately—is intriguing. And it’s very much relat-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ed to work.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>THE FIRST THING IS MONEY
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>DS: We used to make films for so little money and I was very grate
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ful for that training. I mean, I went from making films for S2,000
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to The Wobblies, which cost S180,000. I was pretty spoiled when I
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>finished The Wobblies, because it was reasonably successful. It
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>premiered at the New York Film Festival; it’s been shown in thea
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ters around the country; it’s been in a lot of foreign festivals. And I
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>figured: Great, this is easy, now l’ve got it made. l’Il write another
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>proposal and get some more money. Guess what? No money
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Whatever the sources have been that have supported the inde-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>pendent film community in the past few years are shrinking to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>almost nothing. l’m coming to grips with the grim fact that it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>almost like starting all over again—starting a film with no money,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>having a job, working nights and weekends, asking my friends to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>work for free, stealing film stock—all the ways we started out. I
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>feel like we’ve been doing it for a long time already, for chrissake,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>l’m tired of it! And I don’t feel there’s any hope right now for mak-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>ing films any other way, at least under the present administration.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>CC: Talking about the funding situation, I just came back from
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>the meeting at the PBS National Conference where all the station
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>masters get together and sell their products. The main debate with-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>in the conference was about the S12 million AT&amp;T put out to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>expand the MacNeil-Lehrer Report as a challenge grant. What
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>does that mean? It means SS million has to come from the program
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>fund and S5 million from all the different stations. Overall, the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>Corporation for Public Broadcasting received S23 million from
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>Congress. After allocating all this money to MacNeil-Lehrer,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>Frontline, American Playhouse, etc., there’s very little left for in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>dependents. There was a big controversy around that issue.

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Personally, l’m a little fortunate because I got a grant just
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>before the change in administration. But you can’t look at yourself
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>as a fortunate person—you have to look at the economic situation
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>as a whole. And Reagan cut all the grantors—NEA, NEH. He is
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pledging that the private sector is going to match the remaining
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>money, but obviously that’s ludicrous. The private sector will con
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tribute money only for their own sake. For instance, you know the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>American Masterpiece Theater? Now it’s called Mobil Theater.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>That’s what the future is going to look like. It’s the way public

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>l’ve been looking at it dialectically. There was a period of time
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>when, with large corporation money and federal money, the inde
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>pendents (including myself) went off in their individualistic man
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ner, and in the process many of us gained experience. But now
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>there is a change, and independents have to begin to consolidate
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and organize, pool their resources and equipment, and be able to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cooperate.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>MK: Well, I started working in video because it was the cheapest

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>money.” You don’t have to do CMX editing; you can just work on
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a console, you can work for S20 an hour in somebody’s studio. But,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of course, you’re left with something which isn’t the best technically,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>especially because these machines which are used by a lot of people
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>are always breaking down—you’re never sure whether they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>going to eat your tape. It’s a struggle, but it really is the cheapest
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>way to get something together and get it out. And l’m for video
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>because it’s the medium of now—I mean everybody watches TV.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>MC: Video has a kind of immediacy. When I work, even though I
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>eventually end up with film, I first make videotapes. Before I film I
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>usually conduct interviews and do a tremendous amount of re
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>search. So in the film l’m making about work, I interviewed about
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>50 women on both audiotape and videotape and used all that in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>formation as the basis of the film script. I don’t even think that
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>film is better than video, except for the ease of distribution at this
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>point in history.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>DS: From my point of view, one of the major problems with video
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>is distribution. This is a remnant of my Newsreel training—the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>idea that films are made to be used. My whole first year with News-
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>reel I didn’t make films at all; I went out with them every night
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and showed them at churches and community groups and dormi
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tories. Wherever anyone would give us a blank wall, we’d show up
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>with a projector.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>To me, distribution is important for two reasons. One, it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>important that as many people as possible see the films, that we
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>broaden our public. And there’s always been this dream l’m begin
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ning to think is crazy—that slowly we could begin to earn back
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>through distribution what the films cost to make, instead of being
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>dependent on this grant system, which I find obnoxious anyway.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Even when it’s working, it’s begging people with a lot of money to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>give you a little bit of it to make a film. First-Run Features is an
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>attempt to commercially distribute independently produced films
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>—films that don’t usually get in theaters. It’s working with moder
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ate success, but it’s a struggle. It’s not like Newsreel partly because
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we’re all older and have more financial needs, and people aren’t in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a position to volunteer.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>CC: We need to experiment in new forms of distribution. Distribu
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tion is tied to the product itself. For this film on Mississippi, l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>planning to transfer the film footage to tape, which will be cut for
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>television and video release. But at the same time there remains
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the negative for the film version. There is a possibility to produce
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>both, if the financing and people power are available. Television or
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>cable is relatively convenient for reaching a large audience, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>film format is important for Third World countries and this
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>country too.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>DM: Yes, the other problem with video is distributing outside of
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>America. Europe, for example, is on a different system, and there
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>are places in Third World countries that just don’t have video faci
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lities.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>DS: In Latin America, for instance, it’s even difficult to distribute
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>North American independent films because the circuits are all in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>35mm.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>FORM AND QUALITY
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>DS: The reason that documentaries traditionally don’t get much
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>distribution is that traditionally they’re not very good, they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>boring. I’m personally more interested in seeing the quality im
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>prove, whatever the form, whatever form is appropriate to content.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I feel strongly that among filmmakers like us, among independent
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>filmmakers, we have to encourage the growth of quality of every
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>form, including traditional fiction, genre films, experimental films.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>I get real nervous when I hear these discussions about the correct
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>form for film. I think that what form can express best what some
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>body wants to say depends a lot on the person. For me, it’s more of
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>a challenge to work with real people and to film real people. For
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>me, fiction would be putting words in people’s mouths, and that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>not interesting to me. I understand that for people who make fic
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tion and who work with actors, that’s not what it is to them—it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>shaping a way to say something that they want to say. My way of
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>trying to shape what I want to say is to struggle with all the mistakes
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that real people make. I find that a vital process and a vital way to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>work.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>MC: I agree with Deborah. I think it’s really important that all
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>kinds of films get supported, get made. I don’t believe at all in the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>domination or hierarchy of forms—and that’s what l’m trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>say in my own film work. I think all film forms are important tools
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to get at what you’re trying to say.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>MK: Since Atomic Cafe got such wide distribution and made so
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>much money, I don’t think people feel any longer that documen-
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>tary can’t be entertaining. That kind of editing on that material for
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>a feature-length film was a form I think nobody thought could go
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>over. It was pretty much the same thing over and over and over
			</p>
			<pb n='74'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_74_l' n='N001'/>again, but it fell together partly because of what it was about and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>partly because it was done so well. But technically, it was not con
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>sistently good—because of its magnification, the image often fell
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>apart. So it all depends on what kind of quality you’re talking
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>about.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>For me, it’s the quality of the content that’s really important. I
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>come from a different kind of background so I don’t feel any con-
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>straints about using one documentary style over any other, drama
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>over documentary—you can use any kind as long as you get across
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>the content.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>MN: I have a problem, though, with most so-called political films.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>I think there’s an attitude that since the films are on such impor
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>tant issues, be it wife-beating or abortion or political prisoners in
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>India, you have to like the films; the audience must be sympathetic
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>because the issues are so obviously right. I feel very much for those
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>films, and I certainly think they are important and deserve audi
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>ences and ought to be seen. But they definitely sacrifice quality in a
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>way that it needn’t be sacrificed, especially in the medium of film.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>I don’t know how many films l’ve seen about political issues
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>that could just as effectively be slide shows or panel discussions.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>They show pictures and they have talk. You could make these films
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>doubly, trebly, a hundred times more effective if more care was put
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>into the form. You have to be more ambitious, almost more mani
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>pulative, or, I hesitate to use the word, artistic. You have to use the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>medium.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>Deborah mentioned earlier she’d been interviewing Joris Ivens,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>and he’s such a fantastic example of what I like in political films,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>because he makes films that are so rooted in time, rooted in a cer
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>tain opinion, and yet they last. And they last because of the beauty,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>the poetry that goes into them. There are so few films that concern
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>themselves with issues that Ivens raises and that present themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>in such a manner.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>You can even use dramatic elements—I don’t mean fictional
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>ized but dramatic in terms of editing, involvement with the human
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>characters, allowing people to have a certain space within which
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>we can read their lives instead of always giving us the messages of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>their lives, which, in my opinion, makes people in these films
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>mouth political concerns, more like specimens, like in some anthro
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>pological films.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>CC: I agree with Mira that form and content should be combined,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>as Eisenstein said, all the time. But that also depends on the his
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>torical period, and unfortunately political filmmaking in America
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>has been very short-lived. In the 1930s it lasted briefly, and in the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>1960s Newsreel was one of the pioneers in political filmmaking.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>There was a kind of desperation in the 1960s and ’70s, and many
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>of us made films coming out of those needs and desperation. So
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>sometimes, I would say, content does precede form.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>DS: There’s something Mira said I want to get back to. I think you
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>got to the real point, which is: How effective are our films? I some
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>times say that l’d like to make films that make people laugh or
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>make people cry. l’m a sucker for a good movie; l’d love for my
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>documentaries to be really right-on political documentaries and to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>have a few laughs and all the things that a really good movie should
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>have. That’s one bad legacy that we came out of Newsreel with,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N055'/>which goes back to the whole question of agit-prop.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N056'/>MN: What’s agit-prop?
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N057'/>DS: Agitational propaganda. Agit-prop was a term that we used
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N058'/>for films that were specifically meant to do some political educa
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N059'/>tion task, to rally people, to organize people to go on an anti-war
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N060'/>march. And they worked. I was showing films in Ann Arbor and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N061'/>people would march on the ROTC building when the film ended.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N062'/>But there was one critical mistake in the early Newsreel days.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N063'/>This was about the time that the avant-garde film scene and the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N064'/>political film scene separated, which is something that wasn’t true,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N065'/>for instance, in the Soviet Union; Dziga Vertov’s films were incred-
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N066'/>ibly political and they were also incredibly avant-garde movies. But
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N067'/>we had a mistaken notion that we didn’t want our films to be
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N068'/>“manipulative.” We wanted them to be very truthful, which meant
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N069'/>putting them in stark backgrounds, not paying attention to the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N070'/>aesthetics of a shot. And I think that was a real mistake because
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_72' n='N071'/>film is manipulative. It’s all manipulation. Every image, every
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_73' n='N072'/>choice, from the first shot to the last, from the first cut, the music,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the soundtrack, the effects, everything. I feel the same way about
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the word “manipulation” as I do about the word “propaganda.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Both are considered dirty words and they shouldn’t be; they’re just
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>what we do. All films are propaganda, all films are manipulative.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>We need to learn to be effective, whatever that means. And it
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>certainly doesn’t always mean Hollywood, although in certain
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cases it might mean competing with the look of a Hollywood film if
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that’s the distribution and fundraising you need.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>CC: I think all films are political, all films are agit-prop. It depends
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>on your point of view. Every single Hollywood film has its message,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>whether you like it or not. Kramer vs. Kramer has a particulai
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>political message. Unfortunately, American audiences are not
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>trying hard to look at films.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>DM: I agree with Chris and Margia that obviously the ideal is to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>have the content and the aesthetic, the technique, balanced. But I
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>find it far more intolerable if the content is sacrificed to the aesthe
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tic or technique and not the other way around.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>MC: I think this is related. I would talk about the importance of a
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>pleasurable film as opposed to a documentary or a narrative or
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>whatever. A good-quality film is one that’s pleasurable. One of the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>main things that drives people to traditional Hollywood films is
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>how they perceive pleasure. There’s also some strong ideological

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>for our films to have this element and I think that mixing different
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>approaches to film helps create that kind of pleasure.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>MN: What do you mean by pleasure?
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>MC: I guess I mean satisfying on some level, whether it’s an emo-
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tional level or an intellectual level or a visual level. It’s a very deep
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>involvement with the film but not in terms of traditional narrative,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with characters that you totally identify with and get caught up
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>with. Also, audiences come to films with certain expectations as to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>what the film means. If they think of it as a documentary or if they
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>perceive it as a narrative before they walk in, those expectations
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>are part of the real experience of watching that film and getting
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>your message across. It’s not just a question of what we want to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>make ourselves, but how it’s going to be received by the audience.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>CC: It also depends on audience development. How do you raise
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>audience consciousness to look at films differently? I look at docu-
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>mentary films differently, look at progressive films differently. It’s
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>important for people to do outreach programs to reach, for in

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>for upstate, for rural areas, the South, to reach audiences we nor
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>mally don’t reach, and introduce new film languages to those audi
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ences. We’re doing a program now called In Color about minority
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women and their point of view in filmmaking.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Most filmmakers are a pain. When their film is finished they
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>say, “Ahhh, l’m finished, I don’t want anything to do with it,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>instead of going with the film and speaking with the audience,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>getting their reactions and synthesizing that experience to make
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>their next film. Without that kind of experience, I think audiences
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>will never develop and will continue to be in tune with the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ABC/NBC junk stuff.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>DS: My experience with distribution is that it’s not so much the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>audience that’s our problem as the channels of distribution. I have
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>rarely had an audience receive a film badly. But l’ve had plenty of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>theater owners and exhibitors receive a film badly. One of our
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>basic problems is breaking through this bottleneck. I think audi
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>ences are hungry for—this is something that if I ever stop believing
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>l’d have to stop making films—the kinds of films that people here
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>are making, films that talk about their real problems, their real
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>struggles, their real concerns. And sometimes I think they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>hungry for fantasy, too. And that’s fine.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>That’s where a lot of us started with film: The power of the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>medium is overwhelming. I think we make films for a variety of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>reasons; everyone has personal stories about what led them to it,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>mostly by accident. But the point is the tremendous impact films
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>have on the culture and on consciousness.

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in Israeli society. Her image was construed as particularly significant in light of what is seen
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as a sea of oppressed Arab women surrounding the state of Israel. Conversely, there is a

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Where are we? Spring 1983. Over a decade ago I and other
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>women artists found ourselves with very few options. Pitiably few
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>women earned money with cameras. Pitiably few women earned
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>money from their work at all. Things are different now—not where
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we want them, but different. l’ve worked in stills, film, and video
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for many years, and theré’s an explosion of women’s work visible
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>now that wasn’t there when I started. The issue of money is still a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sore one. l’ve done some crazy things to get my projects made with
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>little or no money. We all have. It’s still depressing how little money
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gets to women. But we’re changing that; in fact, we’ve changed a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>lot already.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Younger women have more options than we did 15 years ago.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>They aren’t as afraid of their competence as we were either. In my
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>teaching I don’t have to trick them into handling equipment as
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>much as I used to. Years of fighting it out with male faculty are
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>paying off. More women are employed than when I was the first
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>woman teaching photography at Pratt Institute in 1970. There are
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>more organizations of women artists now than I can possibly join.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>We’ve moved pretty far since the ’60s, when Art Workers Coali-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tion and Artists United, radical artists’ groups, were dominated by
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>men, and a small group of women responded by forming Women
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Artists in Revolution (WAR). I joined them in late 1969. My sug-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>gestion that the two groups merge generated lots of suspicion and
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>competition (not unusual back then). Money and recognition were
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>scarce. WAR had asked the New York State Council of the Arts to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>fund a building of studios for them. I inherited the project, and
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>when I went to the Council, I was told they weren’t even consider-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ing it. “It wasn’t written up appropriately,” they said, “and any
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>way, women aren’t a minority—WAR isn’t a large enough group-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>not serious enough.” So, together with women from both groups, I
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>wrote a “real” proposal. We created Interart, based on the new
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ways some of us were working with each other. Although we had
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>allies on the Council, they still wouldn’t fund us. So we demon
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>strated in the corridors outside their offices and brought in WBAI
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Radio. After that, they gave us S5000, which wasn’t much for a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>new arts group representing the “silent majority.” I resigned as co-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ordinator shortly after the usual infighting over money began.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>I didn’t realize, then, what an accomplishment that first grant
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>was. I was too busy feeling disappointed in what was happening to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>us. Since then, women’s groups have learned a lot about how to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>organize, get funds, and stay human with each other. Stormy his
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tory aside, l’ve since taught at the Women’s Interart Center, pro-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>duced some film and video with their help, even assisted with fund-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>raising. It isn’t the Women’s Interart Center of my dreams, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>is a place where women can produce work. There wasn’t anything
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>like it a decade ago.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Part of why I wanted the Center, originally, was so I could learn
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>filmmaking with other women. Robin Mide (who first designed the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>theater for the Center) introduced me to Kate Millett. Kate wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>to produce a feature-length documentary made by women: Three
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Lives. In 1970 women making a documentary about women was a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>revolutionary idea. We were the first all-woman company to do it,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and I think Robin was the first lesbian to come out on film. I was a
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>co-director, and directing Robin was exciting and painful. None of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>us knew much about working together, though. When a few of the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>crew took Kate to court for monies the film wasn’t earning, I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>we were losing the revolution. Letting men decide our arguments
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was humiliating. We were in court because of vagueness in the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>wording of our contract and fantasies of riches that never material
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ized. The women instituting proceedings wanted to be paid before
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the producer recouped her initial investment, and they saw their
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>time as equal to her cash. The judge ruled—fairly, I thought—that
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>we all be paid back equally. We’ve yet to be paid back completely,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and Kate will probably never make back her initial investment.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>l’m proud to have worked on that film. I learned a lot. None of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>us knew beans about making a feature, yet we created a piece of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>history. We know about fighting it out, our expectations are more
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>grounded, we value our time, and we write better contracts now.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>When I went to Miami with five other women to videotape the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Democratic National Convention in 1972 (Another Look), I hadn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>yet learned about contracts. This was the convention in which
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>women were expected to “emerge” into mainstream politics—and
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>didn’t. We called ourselves Women’s Video News Service and were
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the first women’s group to cover a major media-event for television
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>(I take pride in my “firsts”). We were sponsored by Teleprompter
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and the Feminist Party (Flo Kennedy). Opening night, everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>had stage fright and wouldn’t go to the convention floor. I hadn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>freaked yet, so I went alone. I was goosed by delegates while trying
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to shoot and interview. Given the scene there, our group did well
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>covering the whole event.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Afterwards we realized that none of us had ever faced such a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>massive editing job before: We had to reduce 30 hours of tape to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>one hour. I had never edited video; nevertheless, I was elected to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>edit the tape. When the editing started taking longer than expect-
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ed, a couple of women kidnapped the tapes. Thinking they’d do it
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>faster, they didn’t do anything at all. After desperate pleading, I
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>got them back. I happen to be a compulsive maniac, so I finished it
			</p>
			<pb n='80'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>in time for broadcast before the election. We were all overwhelmed
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>by what we’d taken on. It was a major accomplishment, but once
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>again the pain involved overshadowed the pride we should have felt.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Three months later my Birth Film premiered at the Whitney
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Museum. I made this film with Kris Glen (since elected Civil Court
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Judge of Manhattan). We had been together in a consciousness
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>raising group for years. When she became pregnant and planned
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to give birth at home, we decided to film it. The women who
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>worked on the project were my friends (one was also a member of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>our CR group). Most of them had little or no film experience. It
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>was an ambitious project for me. I had directed the camerawoman
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>for the “Robin” sequence in Three Lives, but didn’t shoot it my
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>self. Birth Film was to be my debut shooting film. I was scared, but
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the great Spirit was with me and I got beautiful footage. As far as I
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>know, this was the first all-women-made film on birth. There
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>weren’t many birth images around, period, at that time (1970-73),
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and people weren’t used to seeing vaginas—particularly close-ups
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of bloody vaginas, 15 feet tall on the screen. Many people fainted
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and I ended up holding heads while women threw up in the ladies
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>room. People don’t do that anymore—we’ve been showing what we
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>look like for a decade.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The Birth Film was my alternative to film school. I urge women
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to just go out there and do it. Mistakes happen, money is wasted,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>very few people understand what you’re going through, your
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>friends and family think you’re crazy, but you learn fast. This is, in
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>a sense, what we’ve done in the movement—pushing ahead with-
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>out knowing enough, using every bit of experience we had, learning
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wherever we could.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Those were heavy years. Some of us paid high emotional tariffs.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I was involved in a videotaping that left me shattered. I went into it
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>way overextended and almost didn’t come out. I stopped working
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with women for a few years, left the planet for a while, and refocused
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>on my still photography and drawing (private, solitary mediums
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for me). It took me years to realize that I did accomplish some
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>thing—we did accomplish something, back then. I believe it’s im
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>portant to hear from those who burned out or nearly burned out in
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the early ’70s.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In recent years my work with women has been more of a pleas
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ure. We’re a lot more relaxed, and we respect each other. We’re
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>not so much competitors as colleagues. Other things have changed.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>We’re not so afraid of getting out there, of falling on our faces, or
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of being wonderful. We’re not sabotaging ourselves the way we did
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>back then.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>When I made Bag Lady I made a quantum leap. A few years
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>before shooting it, I worked with another group, Video Woman, on
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a documentary directed by Garland Harris, about a woman living
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in welfare hotels. The work was interesting, heartbreaking, and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>provoked many issues of responsibility. The woman started drop
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ping by at all hours for food and money. We did what we could,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>but it became difficult after awhile. What was our responsibility to
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>her? She became pregnant, and her family committed her to a
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>state mental hospital. The tape was never finished. When I started
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>writing Bag Lady, I knew I couldn’t handle that kind of disruption
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>in my life. I was certain l’d end up bringing bag women to my
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>home to live. More pressing, for me, was the desire to work with
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>fiction. I wanted control, to tell the story my way. I felt we needed
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>new archetypes, new myths, to inspire us. On a metaphorical level,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>I believed street women were heroic, with great dignity, and I be-
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>lieved I could say this more effectively with fiction. I wanted a story
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of triumph, not defeat (unfortunately, it’s hard to find triumph in
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the facts of a real bag woman’s life). I interviewed over 25 actresses
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>before meeting Dale Soules, who was starring in The Magic Show
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>on Broadway at that time. I was completely intimidated by the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>prospect of directing someone who earned her living in theater, but
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>she was absolutely right for the character, and her energy and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>commitment to the film matched my own. It was thrilling to watch
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>everybody push themselves beyond what they thought they could
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>do. We were more proud than scared, with a growing tradition of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>women’s art to inspire us.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>I finished that film excited about working with women again,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>but I discovered a new Pandora’s box of issues. This time it was
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>over ownership. I had made the film through the Interart Center,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and guess what, no contract! They believed they owned the film. I
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>believed I did. I did the kidnapping this time. At the same time I
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>had started another film. It was supposed to be made through the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Center, but because of our disagreement, they refused. I went

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>wrestling with my own discomfort, I realized I was afraid of my
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>own confusion in talking about working with a Black woman. I
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>was afraid anything I would say might be construed as racist. Lynn
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and I never spoke about being Black and white while making the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>film. It was important for me, and the film, that she’s Black.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>couldn’t imagine exploring the subject of street women without in
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>cluding Black women—so many of them are Black. When I showed
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>her this article recently, we finally discussed being Black/white in
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>relation to the film. She said the question had never come up for
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>her. I, however, had to move through a lot of fear to create a char-
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>acter with her. It was worth it, and it was just a beginning. Con
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>fronting my own racism has been hard. Working with Lynn was
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>easy.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>Perhaps hardest for me to confront is my own internalized op
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>pression—patterns in my own behavior that keep me down. I have
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>all kinds of self-defeating patterns that are learned and interna

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to show work and speak. Great. Months ago they asked for a bio
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and photo so they could publicize the event. Very reasonable. I
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>didn’t send them. I kept “forgetting.” Now it’s too late for their
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>newsletter, and l’ve ensured myself a smaller audience. Like many
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>others, I keep my own oppression going. l’m changing that—this
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>article is one way. And after thinking about what l’d done, I found
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>a way to get that event listed in a Washington paper.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>It’s important to remember that internalized oppression stems
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from real oppressions. As a Jewish woman, I know that anti-Semit-
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ism still exists, and that I still come up against it. We all know that
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>some Jews are successful, but when you hear that all Jews are suc-
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cessful, you’re hearing anti-Semitism (most Jews are working class).
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>It’s not unusual for Jews of my generation to have a lot of fear and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>confusion about “success.” Personally, I have a lot of ambivalence
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>around recognition. Recognition means visibility. I know a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women who share my approach/avoidance relationship to the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>whole issue of “fame.” Throughout history, Jews have been slaugh-
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tered, often when too many became too successful. You don’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to be Jewish to be hurt by anti-Semitism. We are all hurt by racism,
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>homophobia, and any other oppression. We’ve heard a lot about
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>fear of success—for me, it’s more like fear of mutilation and ex
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>termination.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>It’s taken a lot of work to even recognize these fears. It’s taken
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>physical and spiritual work to become healthy and creative. This
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>work recently took me on a drive of over 5000 miles for a month in
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the desert. It was a major step for me as an artist, a woman, and a
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Jew to go alone to the desert. I wouldn’t have done it 10 years ago.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>It was a coming-of-age ritual; it was also part of the film/video/
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>performance work, Desert Piece, that l’ve been doing for the last
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>two years. The women in the piece gave themselves freely to the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>work, learned from each other, took risks, and put themselves on
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the line. l’ve never worked so well with other women, and l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>never been so comfortable directing.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I feel that there really is more support “out there,” and I can
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>begin to speak. Fear and rage have always rendered me speechless,
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>but with hope I am finding a voice. It’s with hope that l’m going to
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>get through the rest of my life. I can even start to forgive myself
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and others for our lack of grace during this decade.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>For women in media, it’s been very complicated because media
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>is about visibility. We often are involved in making others visible,
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>while keeping a certain anonymity for ourselves. l’m just beginning
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to look at all this, but I think the issue of visibility determines my
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and many other’s behavior. The more I confront this, the more my
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>work and my relationship to getting-it-out-there take off. I (we)
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>don’t have to continue being caught in patterns of fear and silence
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>anymore.

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>needs; but for some reason, I felt that these

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I think this was because at that time
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>feminism was very much a movement of

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>for us to identify with Mothering and to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>look from the position of the Mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Unwittingly, then, we repeated the

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>novel Stella Dallas, by Olive Higgins. It
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>shows how the cinema had already, by

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wealth. Within the film Stella Dallas, we
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>find the poor on the outside (Laurel&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mother, Stella) and the rich on the inside
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>(Laurel and the Morrisons). This mimics,

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the Morrison family. She is excluded not
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>only as a working-class woman, but also as
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the Mother. Ben Brewster notes that the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>1923 novel moves Laurel “decisively into
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the world of Helen Morrison, shifting its

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Stella Dallas, who abolishes herself as visi

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>process by which Stella Dallas makes her
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>self literally Mother-as-spectator that
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>interests me, for it symbolizes the position

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Stella is actually a complex mixture of
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a number of the Mother paradigms. She
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tries to resist the position as Mother that
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>patriarchal marriage, within the film, seeks

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to Mothering because of the personal sacri-

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of dress. The film punishes her for both
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>forms of resistance by turning her into a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>“spectacle” produced by the upper class’

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and editing.

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>knows is a runaway millionaire.

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>this time her flawless acting wins her what
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>she wants. Dressed as a virginal young
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>lady, she gazes adoringly up at Stephen
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>instead of following the directions he is

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>giving her—an attention that surprises but
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>flatters the heart-sick man.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Shortly after this, we find Stephen and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Stella at the movies. A shot of upper-class

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>scene confirms that Stella has been acting
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>“as if in the movies,” performing with
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Stephen accordingto codes learned through

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and about how to respond to movies. As the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>film ends, Stella is weeping; and as wom

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>we are both offered a model of how we

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>has added two levels: Stella and Stephen in
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the movie house, and Stella and Stephen
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>as “spectacle” for the street audience.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Stella will herself create yet another spec

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>end of the film. Stella has made her daugh
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ter into a “movie star” through whom she
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>can live vicariously.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>This is only possible through Mother
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>hood as constructed in patriarchy, and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>thus Stella’s own mothering is central to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>her trajectory. It is fitting that the movie
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>scene cuts directly to Stella’s haggarc
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>mother laboring in her kitchen the follow
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ing morning. Her victimization is under
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>scored by her total fear of Stella’s father,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>who is yelling loudly. Both the mother and

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sins.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>This is the last we see of Stella’s fami

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing-class family is eliminated on Stella’s

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>world—it is made as invisible in filmic
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>terms as it is culturally. What Stella has to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>contend with are her remaining working
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>class desires, attitudes, and behaviors,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>which the film sees ambiguously as either
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ineradicable (which would involve an un
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>characteristic class determinism), or as
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>deliberately retained by Stella. Women are
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>socialized to be flexible precisely so that
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>they can marry into a higher class, taking
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>their family up a notch as they do so. We
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>have seen that Stella is aware of how she
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>should behave. (“I want to be with you,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>she tells Stephen after seeing the movie,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>want to be like you. I want to be like all the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>people you’ve been around.”) But Stella
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>resists this change once she has won he
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>upper-class man, which makes her at once
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>a more interesting and a more tragic hero
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ine. Given the structures that bind her, she
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>has more sense of self than is ultimately
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>good for her.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>It is both Stella’s (brief) resistance to

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>willingly shoulders. If the wife, like Stella,

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly called art can have a politi-
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cal impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our identities as
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women play a distinct role. We hope that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radi
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cal political and aesthetic theory, as well as generate new creative energies among women
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>It will be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to broadening the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>HERESIES is published by a collective of feminists, some of whom are also socialists,
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>marxists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists; our fields include painting, sculpture, writing
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture, filmmaking, photography,
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and video. While the themes of the individual issues will be determined by the collective,
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>each issue will have a different editorial staff, composed of women who want to work on
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that issue as well as members of the collective. HERESIES provides experience for women
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>who work editorially, in design and in production. An open evaluation meeting will be held
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>after the appearance of each issue. HERESIES will try to be accountable to and in touch
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>with the international feminist community.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our arts,
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections are clarified, they can func-
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tion as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to understand
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the relationship between art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystifi
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>cation of art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art within the present
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product. We will not
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>advertise a new set of genius-products just because they are made by women. We are not
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the competitive mentality that per
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>vades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the process of this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art.
