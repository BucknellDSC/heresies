				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Heresies is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>examination of art and politics from a feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>perspective. We believe that what is commonly called art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>can have a political impact and that in the making of art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and all cultural artifacts our identities as women play
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a distinct role. We hope that Heresies continues to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>theory as well as to generate new creative energies
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>among women. It is a place where diversity can be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>articulated. We are committed to broadening the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Heresies is published by a collective of feminists, some
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of whom are also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>or anarchists; our fields include painting, sculpture,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>writing, curating, literature, anthropology, political
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>science, psychology, art history, printmaking,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>photography, illustration, and artists’ books. While the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>themes of the individual issues are determined by the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>collective, each issue has a different volunteer editorial
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>staff composed of members of the mother collective and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>other women interested in that theme. Heresies provides
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>experience for women who work editorially, in design, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in production. Heresies tries to be accountable to and in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>touch with the international feminist community.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>between our lives, our arts, and our ideas have been
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>suppressed. Once these connections are clarified, they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>can function as a means to dissolve the alienation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>between artist and audience and to understand the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>relationship between art and politics, work and workers.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>As a step toward the demystification of art, we reject the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>standard relationship of criticism to art within the present
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>system, which has often become the relationship of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>genius-products just because they are made by women.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>nor to the competitive mentality that pervades the art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>world. Our view of feminism is one of process and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>change, and we feel that through this dialogue we can
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>foster a change in the meaning of art.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The end of the colonial era has led to paradigmatic shifts in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the humanities and social sciences, making postcolonial discourse
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>a major theoretical influence. Today the collapse of many so-called
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>totalitarian regimes calls for a similar reorientation. IdiomA aims to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>contribute to and challenge methods of cultural analysis
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>including feminism, Marxism, psychoanalysis, semiotics, discourse
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>analysis, and others — while explicitly taking into consideration the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>phenomenon of totalitarian societies.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>IdiomA has both an international and a cross-disciplinary
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>perspective, following the conviction that contributions from
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sociology, political science, anthropology, and linguistics can
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>greatly benefit cultural theory. At the same time, we believe that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>theorizations of culture are to be found not just in scholarly writings
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>but also in artistic practice.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>We further believe that the histories of both democratic and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>totalitarian societies are part of the modern project. The
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>problematics of cultural theory in the West are largely determined
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>by &quot;forgetting&quot; the cultural forms that modemity assumed in other
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>societies, such as the ex-Soviet bloc countries. IdiomA will foster
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>interdisciplinary and international dialogues by aiming to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>reformulate such issues as culture and power, the functioning of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ideology, political systems and gender, and strategies of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>resistance, and by juxtaposing and comparing the cultura
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>mechanisms at work in Eastern and Western societies.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Recent political changes in Eastem Europe made public for
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the first time the discussions and investigations of “totalitarian
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>structures in these countries. This easing of censorship, together
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>with improved access to Western sources and historical materials,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>has resulted in many unorthodox writings on culture and politics,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>some of which are now becoming available to the Westem reader

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>immigration clerk at the border. While transcribing my
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>documents into English she made a clean incision, without
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a drop of ink, and cut off the a from the end of my name. It
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was thrown into the sea, into the void between the two

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>right there and then that my precious letter could be gotten
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>back, although it would be only a prosthesis. We shared

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>reasonable level of distribution and become part of an
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>international dialogue. Perestroika, whether one wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>acknowledge it or not, said Irina, had given rise to rea
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>conversation and to finding out who people were as
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>individuals. Used to concealing their stories, women
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>had suddenly started revealing themselves, speaking
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>out, acting out. Exhibitions, events, and articles
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>resulted; IdiomA was created.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Irina and Natasha brought with them typeset

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>print. Several women they met in New York, including Heresies
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>founders Elizabeth Hess and Joyce Kozloff, had suggested
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Heresies as a possible collaborator for IdiomA.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>At that moment Heresies was short on funds and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>short on active members, but everyone who was at the

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>for Jo as well as for Heresies, Jo’s sabbatical from Hobart and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>William Smith Colleges coincided with our work on this issue. We
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>are grateful to Jo for spending hours hunting down and labeling

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>been printed only in Russian because it is already extremely well
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>known in English. Jo Anna Isaak’s very long essay has been
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>printed only in English for the sake of economy, but a Russian

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>with copies sold overseas. The production process — the hands

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>noun that has no feminine form. Uchonyaya
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>can be used only as a adjective to mean that
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a particular woman is a learned person, but
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>there exists no category of female scholars
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>as such to which she could belong. As a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>learned woman, she is therefore an exception.

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>formulations. In a recent interview the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>prominent Russian writer Tatyana Tolstaya
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>claimed that feminism was really a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>consequence of the commonplace habit in the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>West of thinking in terms of stereotypes: “You
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>know what feminists invented: they invented
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the idea of phallocracy — that the world is bad
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>because it is ruled by men. That is completely
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ridiculous because, for example, England is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ruled by a woman.&quot;2 Tolstaya speaks from
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>within the limitations of essentialist thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and her statements reveal both the limitations
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and the sexisms inherent in construing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>femininity in these terms. The fact that her
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>opinions are similar to those that would be
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>expressed by the least informed and most
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>unsympathetic members of our society gives
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>us some indication of how widespread are the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>misgivings and misunderstandings about
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>feminism.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>The artist Natalya Nesterova (b.1944)
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>was reluctant to be included in an all-women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>art exhibition. She clearly felt the need to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>distance herself from the category “woman

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>artists, apart from a few exceptions. Men
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>happen to be more intelligent. Professions that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>require a lot of wit and intelligence should be
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>done by men, and art is as much a matter of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the mind as it is of the heart. When asked
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>about herself, she said, “Me, I am an
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>exception.&quot;3 In spite of such statements,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Nesterova is not at all an unsympathetic
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>woman. She wants only the right to forget
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>herself as woman, but her own comments
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>reveal that to do so she must participate in the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>exclusion or negation of women. Nesterova is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>an official artist, highly favored by the Artists
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Union, to which she was admitted in 1969. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>views are commonplace among the few women
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>who have achieved prominence within male
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>dominated institutions; the cost of their
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>success can be read in such denigrations of

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>repeatedly refers to herself as if she were an
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>aberration, saying that women have no place in

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>debates. Their resistance is grounded in a

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>intellectual history.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Feminism stands in a particularly vexed
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>position vis-à-vis a number of conflicting
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>currents within both official and unofficial
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Soviet ideology. With the 1917 revolution came
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the most extensive social restructuring in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>modern history, one that arguably, even to this
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>day, articulates the most progressive programs
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>of emancipation for women.“ The women and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>men engaged in working out these reforms
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>were not involved in feminist activism in the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>usual sense; they were not a disenfranchised
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>group with little power, working to improve the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>condition of women in general. The women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>section of the Bolshevik party, the Zhenotdel,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>was not an oppositional group, but rather an
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>integral part of the government. A separate
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>feminist movement outside the party was
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>discouraged on the grounds that it could lead
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to a contingent of labor breaking away from the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>common class struggle. It was under charges
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of bourgeois individualism that the Zhenotdel
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>was dismantled in 1930, and these charges
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>resonate in the lives of women today, who are
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sensitive to the notion that feminism (which
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>they associate much more with current Western
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>feminism than with their own historical
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>women’s movement) is somehow “selfish.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>While they may be acutely aware of women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>daily hardships, they are less likely to rectify
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>those wrongs through collective action with
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>other women than to work on behalf of their
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>family or immediate community. Women are
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>quick to point out that conditions are not good
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>for men, either. Also, many Soviet women
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>would avoid participating in a feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>movement because they have developed a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>deep distrust of all political movements and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>collective identities, seeing them as
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>infringements on the autonomy of the individual
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>rather than as vehicles of group empowerment.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>This may be particularly true for women artists
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and writers who have found in the activity of art
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>making a venue for personal, subjective
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>expression — something denied them in most
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>other areas of their lives. The idea of organizing

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>a different kind of treatment or visibility is often
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>seen by them as inimical to what is most

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the exploration of their own subjectivity. I have
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>visited the Soviet Union five times since 1981
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and have made scores of studio visits; during
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that time I came to understand that a good
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>deal of the art l was seeing was political, if only
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in its assertion of the validity of the personal.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>associated with IdiomA will increase. Their
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>movement may need to recapitulate some
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>developments of Western feminism, including
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>some of our mistakes; it is also possible that

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Eurocentric points of reference, to look, not for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>more problems, but rather for alternatives to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>our own practices. We know very little about
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cultural production in countries that are not
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>capitalist or not, at least not yet, caught up in

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Baltic region, where for decades women have
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>taken the leading role in cultural production.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>to expand its analytical perspective to include
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>non-Western versions of modernism, such as
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the Russian avant-garde. Western feminist

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>who belonged to this revolutionary art
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>movement of, loosely, 1910-1930. It is the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>first historical epoch in which women were able
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to contribute freely as cultural workers,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>theoreticians, and art educators, and they did
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>so in large numbers, producing works of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>exceptional merit. The reviews of the Costakis

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>focused on what for Western critics was a novel
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>phenomenon: the achievements of women
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>artists. Hilton Kramer wrote, “The Russian
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>avant-garde was the only movement of its kind
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in which the achievements of women were
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>unquestionably equal to their male
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>colleagues ....&quot;5 The question that presents
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>itself is why, at this particular historical
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>moment, women came into the forefront of the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>avant-garde in large numbers and why this did
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>not occur in the West.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Even their contemporary critics were awed
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>by these women. Writing about the women
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>artists of his generation, Benedikt Livshits said,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>These were the real Amazons, these Scythian
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>riders.&quot;e He is referring to the earliest historical
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>references to women in Russia, invoking a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>legendary society of women who dominated the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>south of ancient Rus. Information about them
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>comes from early Greek texts, which describe
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>them as skilled riders and warriors as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>astute linguists. (Herodotus reports that they
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>quickly learned the language of the men with
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>whom they briefly consorted, while the men
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>never mastered theirs.) It is interesting that
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Livshits, who himself worked with the women
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>artists of Russia’s avant-garde, collaborating or
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>what was to be one of the most fascinating
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>chapters in the history of art, describes them in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>these mythic terms, as if they were legends in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>their own time.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The myth of the strong Russian woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>like all myths pertaining to women, is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>something to be wary of; nevertheless, it may
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>have functioned as an enabling myth compared
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>to the debilitating constructions of woman as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the “weaker sex,&quot; “the angel of the house, or
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the “femme fatale.&quot; In the case of women
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>artists, these alternative constructions become
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>particularly significant. Rozsika Parker and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Griselda Pollock have persuasively argued that
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>in England and Europe by the nineteenth
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>century, with the consolidation of a patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>bourgeoisie as the dominant class, femininity
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>was constructed as exclusively domestic and
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>maternal, despite the fact that more and more
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>women were of necessity entering the labor
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>force. At the same time, evolving bourgeois
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>notions of the artist associated creativity with
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>everything that was antidomestic, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Bohemian model of the free-living, sexually
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>energetic, socially alienated “genius” became
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the stereotype of the artist who was, by this
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>definition, male. Art was represented as the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ideal of self-fulfilling, creative activity, and its
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>antithesis was proletarian alienated labor, but
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>its full opposite, suggests Pollock, “is the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>repetitive and self-effacing drudgery of what is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>called woman’s work.&quot;&quot;8 Through such
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>constructs, artists and women were allotted
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>almost antithetical, yet equally marginalized,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>roles within Western bourgeois culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>This historical bifurcation, between
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>woman and artist on the one hand, and artist
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and participatory member of society on the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>other, did not take place in Russia because
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Russia lacked a bourgeoisie of the sort that
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>provided the impetus for developing a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>comparable ideology of domesticity. In contrast
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>with the middle class in industrializing Europe
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and America, which had begun to idealize
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>family life, most progressive Russians found
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>such an ideal self-centered. The novelist
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Nadezhda Khvoshchinskaia spoke for many of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>them when she wrote that family happiness is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the “vulgar happiness of locked-up houses,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tidy and orderly; they seem to smile a welcome
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>at the outsider, but they give him nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>but that smug and stupid smile. These oases
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>are simply individual egotism united into family
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>egotism. They are orderly, temperate, and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>self-satisfied — and totally self-involved.”s
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>This antifamily sentiment was widespread,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and many Russian women began to seek
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>out ways of participating in public life. During
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the late nineteenth century, numbers of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>doctors, teachers, artists, and other members
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>of the intelligentsia — hundreds of them
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>women — travelled to the countryside to work
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>toward ameliorating poor living conditions in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>peasant communities. The women in particular
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>took on this work with the altruism of a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>religious campaign. Utterly dedicated, living
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>in wretched material conditions, often without
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the comfort of family or personal relationships,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>they devoted their lives to improving the lot
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>of the Russian peasants. While these were

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>more interested in improving the conditions

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>circumstances), from their activities the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>women’s movement emerged and resulted
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>in advances for women in higher education,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>particularly medicine and education, and in

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Several artists’ colonies and art schools,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>some established by women, were based upon
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a similar hybrid of philanthropic and democratic
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>strivings. Long before the revolution, there was
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a well developed tradition of social commitment
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>on the part of both women and artists. A good
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>deal of the work made by the artists in these
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>colonies was based upon folk art and crafts
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and was intended to be of use to the local
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>population. One of the most prominent
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>members of the early avant-garde was Natalya
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Goncharova (1881-1962), whose paintings of
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>1909-1912 depicted the cyclical life and labor
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of the Russian peasantry. Goncharova’s work
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>was deeply influenced by Russian folk
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>traditions, such as the popular wood-block print
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>(lubok), semiabstract embroidery patterns,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ancient Scythian sculpture, wood carvings, and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>icon paintings. Unlike the cultural

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Russia was fueled by nationalist sentiment.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Such attitudes had considerable influence on
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the inception of abstract art, which in Russia
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was to follow a vastly different trajectory from
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that of abstractionism in the West.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In 1913 Goncharova wrote a remarkable
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>manifesto in which she distinguished Russian
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>art from Western art expressly because of the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>West’s adherence to archaic notions of

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>radical shift in roles was necessary for artists,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>influenced by utilitarian craft traditions, to turn
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>their energies to such things as housing,

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>mundane material domestic needs, to the petty

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Russian are called byt and affect women most
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>directly. For this reason it can be argued that a

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>inherently a feminist art practice. A good

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>am conscious that women walking in the

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of not being associated with objects of property
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>made me feel more confident, more at liberty
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>when in Moscow. However, when my husband

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>women, but obviously I just can’t. In the Soviet

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>explains that it is particularly hard to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>woman artist “because most men think that art
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is secondary for a woman. Even in families
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>where both husband and wife are artists, what
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>time a woman has left for art is what’s left after
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>cooking, laundry, cleaning, standing in lines,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>etc. Even if a woman manages to find time for
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>art, she faces the problem of getting supplies
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and transportation of works. Since you are
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>equal to men and got into this of your own free
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>will, nobody will help you just because you are a

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>at all. Besides, in our country you can get
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>something only if you have certain business
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>connections and personal contacts. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>impossible to obtain anything legally, like a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>studio, for example. Women are not

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>money. And if, after all this, a woman still has
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the desire to paint pictures, they have to look
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>as easy and as natural as those painted by a

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Recently in St. Petersburg I came upon a

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>images, thinking the pin-up girl was the visual
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>gambit to call attention to the computer, but

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Although the role of the computer was unclear,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>it could simply have been the signifier of all

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>posters of the thirties. Now the emphasis was
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>on the appearance of the woman, not on her
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>work potential. In very real terms, however, this
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>billboard was no less about women and work

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>strategy, desire was aroused in order to be
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>appropriated. As in Germany under National
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>Socialism, there were many images of female
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>fecundity; bare-breasted harvesters or nursing
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>mothers were very popular, as were nude
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>female athletes or bathing scenes that allowed
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N009'/>the artist to depict the nude in numerous
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N010'/>postures. Deineka’s Football, for example,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N011'/>depicts three nude women chasing a ball. The
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N012'/>title provides the same pseudo-rationale for
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N013'/>viewing these women from various vantage
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N014'/>points as the theme of the judgement of Paris
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N015'/>did for the painters of the French Academy.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N016'/>Alexsandr Samokhvalov’s After Running (1934)
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N017'/>is a classic of this genre. It depicts a female
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N018'/>athlete drying her moist, seminude body; her
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N019'/>panties are pulled down to reveal a little of her
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N020'/>pubic hair. The obsession with the healthy
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N021'/>athletic body as a form of sexual sublimation
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N022'/>during the Stalinist period is remarkably similar

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>was seen only by a small group of friends.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Exhibition space was difficult to come by and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>had to be arranged through the Artists’ Union,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>an organization that didn’t seem to bestir itself
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>too often even on behalf of artists who were
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>members. Most of the artists I met were not
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>members. When I first started visiting artists
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>studios I found a small and, at least in my
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>experience of visiting women artists, very
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>generous artists’ community, one that was
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tightly knit and highly supportive. One artist
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>would invariably take me to see the work of
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>another. While the work suffered from lack of
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>materials and lack of critical attention, the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that these women were working in relative
			</p>
			<pb n='23'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>obscurity had its advantages. As one artist put
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it, “No one sees this work, so it can be totally
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>free.&quot; On the other hand, the constraints
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>placed upon official artists manifested
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>themselves in various ways. During the 1970s,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a period of relative liberalization, a number of
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women artists were admitted to the Artists
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Union; Tatyana Nazarenko, Natalia Nesterova,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>T. Nasipova, Olga Bulgakova, M. Tabaka, and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>A. Vint are among the most well known. No one
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>declined an offer to join the Artists’ Union; the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>benefits (salary, studio, and art supplies) were
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>too great. The price paid for this acceptance
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was that the artist was to some degree
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>expected to work in the service of the state.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Responses ranged from identification with the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>institution, to small, sanity-preserving
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>subversions.

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>members of the Artists’ Union, she was sent

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>typical assignment, yet it shows that interesting
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>work can be produced within the confines of
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the requirements of Socialist Realism. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Leger’s merging of men and machines, the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tubular structure of the huge pipes is echoed in

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>amongst the pipes, patting on insulation by
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>hand. Many of Nazarenko’s works, particularly
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the large-scale historical paintings, can be
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>found in the Tretyakov. In her studio, however,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>one can find traces of Nazarenko’s resistance
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to her “success. Circus Girl (1984) is a
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>portrait of herself dressed in a bikini doing a
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>precarious high-wire act. Below her the officials
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of the Artists’ Union politely applaud her act,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>which is all the more remarkable because she
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>is working without even a wire. On her return
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>from a recent trip to the United States, she
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>painted a record of her experiences. Her body
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>is served up in a large chafing dish while a

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>unintelligibility, yet enough remains of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>questions such as “Who Sold Us to
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Afghanistan?” or the familiar Stalinist slogans
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>&quot;Who Is With Me?” and “The Party Decides

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>1988. In 1989 Turnova began a series of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>rather irreverent portraits of then famous, now
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>infamous, public figures. This work takes on a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>prophetic dimension in the context of the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>statue smashing and the proliferation of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>posters and cartoons attacking public figures
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that took place after the failed coup of August
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>1991. In her most recent work large-scale
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>portraits are cut out and installed as free
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>standing sculptures throughout the gallery so
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that viewers can walk around them, get a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sense of their flatness, even have their own
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>photos taken alongside them. It is interesting
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to compare Turnova’s portraits of Ryazhsky,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Voroshilov, Ordzjonikize, Lenin, and Gorbachev
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with Leon Golub’s portraits of powerful men-
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Kissinger, Rockefeller, Arafat, and so on. In
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>both cases, the homogeneity of treatment
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>causes the men to become almost anonymous,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>almost interchangeable. In both series
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>masculinity is explored as masquerade, and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>power itself is revealed as a puton. Turnova’s
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>portraits, however, seem more provocative; in
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>part this is a result of reducing these public
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>icons to comic caricatures and in part a result
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of the context — Soviet citzens, at least until
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>1991, were not used to seeing their public
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>figures “sent up&quot; in this way. What is most
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>disturbing about Turnova’s portraits is that they
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>are given smiles and made to look a little
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>jaunty, almost what in America would be called
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>fun loving. The effect is truly sinister.

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>work is banner bold, the messages in the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>paintings of Elena Keller (b.1951) are coded
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and arcane, more like the half-intelligible traces
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of a prisoner furtively trying to communicate
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>with the outside world. Seemingly abstract
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>paintings reveal themselves to be political
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>allegories. A random splattering of red against
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>a yellow background becomes, on closer
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>examination, a map of the Soviet Union; in the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>center a stick figure lies in a grid, or is it caught
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>in a trap? Is this a reference to the internment
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>camps located throughout the Soviet Union, or

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>down upon the figure — a reference to Danae

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>spiritual infusion from above, or are these

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Much of the work I saw during my first
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>visits was heavily imbedded in a conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>that Soviet people were just beginning to have
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>with foreigners. This is a country in which many
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>people are absent: they died in the war, they
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>died in the purges, they died during the

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>buildings, where something of their physical
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>being seems to linger. “1 feel that in this room
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>there have been many people here before me

			<pb n='26'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>in an investigation of the representation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>self. Unlike many Western women artists, they
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>are not seeking to deconstruct the images of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>woman that have been mass-produced by
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>advertising. Instead, many Soviet women
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>artists seem to be engaged in a private, almost
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>obsessive recording of the self. For example,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the bulk of the more than forty years’ work of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Clara Golitsina (b.1925) are self-portraits. In
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>part this is a result of expediency — the artist
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>is always available as model. It is also the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>result of circumstances. Other paintings have
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>been sold or given to friends; those that remain
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>in the artist’s small apartment are the the ones
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>done for herself. When seen together these
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>self-portraits, tracing the narrative of a life in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>almost novelistic terms, provide a record rarely
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>available to us in paint. They begin with the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>self-portraits of the artist in young womanhood,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in which she seems to be trying to see herself
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>as others see her. If it were not for the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>steadfast stare of the young woman, these
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>works could be impressionist paintings of a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>pretty young woman in a sun hat. The gaze,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>directed at the viewer, will be a constant
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>throughout the years. In later paintings she
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>becomes more purposeful, more direct; the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>woman now addresses the viewer more
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>confidently. Her hair is cut short, the clothes
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>are simpler, the hat more functional than
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>stylish. The viewer is not provided with
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>distractions; the face fills the picture frame.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>There is no longer any question; these are self
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>portraits. Although the recording of time upon
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the face progresses with unflattering objectivity,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>these are not portraits of someone obsessed
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with aging but with the process of painting.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>As viewers of Golitsina’s portraits, we are
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>caught up in this obsession. Like readers of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a narrative, we feel obliged to try to read from
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the repeated physiognomy some meaning, to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>seek the meaning of another’s life, to come to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>some closure. The portraits do not suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>varying emotions, with one exception — a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>series of expressionistic, haunting works done
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in the 1980s after the death of her husband.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Afterward there is a hiatus. The last self-portrait
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>saw was done in 1988; the gaze is now
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>directed towards a book in the artist’s hand,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the hat has a colorful bow, a bird sits on her
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>shoulder (a bird the artist found injured on her
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>balcony that has stayed on as a pet). The face
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>is of indeterminate age; were it not for the date
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>on the back, this self-portrait could easily be
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>confused with those of earlier, happier days.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Elena Figurina (b.1955) also seems to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>be engaged in an extended self-analysis. Like

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>engineer. Figurina began painting in 1980 with
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>a series of portraits, some of friends, one of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Van Gogh, and several self-portraits. These
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>early self-portraits were crude expressionist
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>works, the features highly stylized and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>distorted, executed with broad, simple strokes.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The colors, reduced to a primary palette with
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>red and yellow predominating, are used
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>arbitrarily, and green blotches, reminiscent
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of Matisse’s fauve period, appear on the face.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Figurina’s explorations of the self expand to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>include family groupings of the artist with her
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mother, father, and sister. All distinguishing
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>features are minimized, and all members of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the family come to look alike. In later works
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>this family resemblance is extended. Groups
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of people all resembling one another, yet all
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>resembling the artist, are engaged in activities
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>such as walking, picking apples, standing in
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>fields with cows, catching birds, cleaning fish,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dancing, playing in the sand, or just standing,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>either engrossed in quiet contemplation or
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>looking out at us. In a painting called Masks
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>(1989) four figures, carrying bright yellow
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>masks, are as devoid of distinguishing features
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>as the masks. Like characters in folk tales,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>they interact with animals, who in turn take on
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>human characteristics, looking inquisitively or
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>balefully at the humans painted in the same
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>primary colors. People and animals carry out
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>their activities in the bright, indefinite, and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>timeless background of Matisse’s dancers, and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>like Matisse’s figures, their physical bodies are
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>extended or distorted in such a way as to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>harmonize with their activity or to convey
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>emotion. Stylistically, Figurina’s work is closely
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>associated with Russian primitivism and the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>folk art revived by artists such as Goncharova,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Larionov, and Malevich at the turn of the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>century. Her figures are engaged in the same
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tasks and are as simplified and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>nonindividuated as Goncharova’s peasants.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Figurina’s paintings, however, are not a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>celebration of peasant life; they are engaged in

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N004'/>Historically, Soviet artists have been very

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N007'/>sexually suggestive material had been
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N008'/>forbidden to artists in several directives issued
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N009'/>by the ministry of culture during the Stalinist
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N010'/>era. Obviously the ban acted as a deterrent,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N011'/>although as early as 1968 Nonna Gronova and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N012'/>her husband Francisco Infante staged an
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N013'/>outdoor performance in the snow in which

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N016'/>her own nude body was a transgressive act,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N017'/>Gronova was not exploring sexuality in her
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N018'/>performance. While it is impossible to

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N020'/>say that Soviet culture has not regarded
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N021'/>sexuality as the locus of subjectivity. It is not

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>construction of gender. The curatorial team of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Olesya Turkina and Victor Mazin have organized
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>three such exhibitions. The first, called Women
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in Art (1989), was a retrospective, with
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sections dedicated to female students of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Malevich and Filonov as well as to work from

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>In her recent work Irina Nakhova (b.1955)
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>has been exploring the construction of gender
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>as a by-product of all cultural production. For
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>several years Nakhova has been examining the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>interstices between process and completion,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>between fragmentation and wholeness,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>between the extant and the ruined, between
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>renewal and decay. This began with a series of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>paintings called Scaffoldings, in which the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>focus was on the scaffolding itself, the process
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of restoration, not on what was being restored

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>perestroika. After her visit to Italy she began

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>presented by Nakhova as inwardly riven. In her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>work the classical body is subject to aging and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>decay just like the material body. In this re
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>presentation of classical art Nakhova seems to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>have discovered, almost as if by accident, the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gender assumptions upon which it is based. In
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her latest works she paints pairs of male and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>female faces or torsos from antiquity. As
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>classical statuary they show the effects of time
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>upon them in chips and broken limbs, and as
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>material beings, in sagging and wrinkles. All
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the pairs are cracked; in one set the cracks
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>appear in a random pattern suggesting age or
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>accident, in another the cracks appear along
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the lines of a perfectly symmetrical grid. The
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cracks are identical so that the viewer can
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>exchange the pieces like a jigsaw puzzle, and in

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>completion and perfection, become as

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>at it. In this manipulation of attention, the
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>materiality of language is foregrounded. The
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>movements of semantic and narrative
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>construction are suspended or reversed; the

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of language, usurps the place of the narrative.

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>adjustments. The texts are passages from

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>language which turns all into a paysage
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>moralisé — a landscape onto which man
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>imparts and from which he seeks to extract
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>meaning. It is not the “real&quot; that

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>vision, had been silenced by what she
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>describes as “the oppressive role of literature
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>in the Russian visual arts; literature drives the

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>background.” In Kopystianskaya’s landscapes
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the viewer is asked to let go of the imposed
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>significance and focus instead upon something
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>far more elusive, something that is only artistic
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>transparency and without substance.

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Byzantium. It was due to the sacred tradition

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>sacralization of writing — the Holy Writ
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>initially observed in pagan cults. The magic of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>a letter is ascribed to its divine origin. Chinese
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>writing is thus believed to have been created by
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the god Tzan-tze; Indian writing, by Brahma;

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Allah. During the so-called Dark Ages, Latin and
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Greek alphabets were treated in Christian
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>esoteric teachings as ideographies of the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>greatest myths, signifying Microcosm and

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>influence of the Kabbala. The Age of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Enlightenment brought this tradition to an end,

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The idea of a new writing was appealing to the

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>These GULag sororities were socialist:
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>problems were discussed at meetings and
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>solutions approved by a majority vote. Elected
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>leaders (kapos) were responsible for a just
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>distribution of labor and food and looked for
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>possible compromises with the camp

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and political consciousness were valued highly.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>There were unwritten codes of dignity and
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>chastity, which were hard to observe because

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>prosecuted by boycott or even ostracism. The
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>norms of democratic socialism and socialist
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>collectivism proved helpful in surviving.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Such patterns were typical of women and
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of women only, for in no man’s GULag memoirs
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>can we find anything similar. Symptomatically,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>men and women described different attitudes
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to camp labor. For men, slavery toil at timber
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>felling or mining was the extreme form of
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>humiliation, an analogue of capital punishment
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>executed in a torturing manner, which was
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>obviously the intention. For women, work was
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the only way to feel at one with God and
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>humanity, the only means to preserve the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>human self. Women who survived adapted the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>experience of GULag socialism to their lives in
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>freedom. What they had endured was an
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>unforgettable school of life, and their children
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>drank in the education along with the milk, thus

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>mothers’ training. We should also not forget
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>that in the late 1940s girls were separated
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>from boys at school, which suggests the same

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Totalitarian androgyny began as a socialist

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>i What ! think is wrong with this is the means by which this
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was achieved. I do not think that many American feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>would admit that the ends justify the means, even if the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>aim is as noble as that of women’s liberation. Another
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>thing that I think is completely wrong is the idea that
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women’s freedom was really achieved. It was only
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>proclaimed, as I tried to show in my paper that the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>emancipated Soviet woman was another lie which served
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the aim of her ultimate enslavement — not so much to the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>man who became irrelevant but to the State, and to the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>deology. But the word (in this case, “sexual equality&quot;),
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>whether it is truthful or otherwise, has the power of
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>producing reality. The paradox is that the desired effect
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was reached in the long run, and Soviet men and women
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>did achieve a sort of angelical (e)quality, a sexual in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>difference (in-discrimination) which was forced on them by
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>political and economic structures. The forced “angelhood&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>is what I call totalitarian androgyny, and I cannot think of it
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>as a positive move. The collapse of totalitarian system
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>brought about the end of this pseudoandrogyny.

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>masculinized women. But the idea of true sexual equality
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>has been so much compromised by the totalitarian practice
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that ! can foretell the lack of success of any women’s

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>starting point (ab ovo) and the culmination of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the man-woman relationship; the localization of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>male and female potency. The egg can be

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>product. It can be a metaphor of priority, as in

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>chicken or the egg. The philosophical egg is the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>key to the truth. An egg eaten away is pure
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>form, art for art’s sake. Here the viewer is

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N005'/>a temporal dimension. Korsakova, as one of

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>represents the work of women artists in
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Leningrad, is defined by material, that is,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>textile. Weaving is traditionally considered to be
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a woman’s art. The Parkas spinning the thread
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of Fate provide perhaps the most mysterious

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>workers. The “material culture” of Leningrad
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>also evokes a rich national tradition that ranges
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from Tatlin’s counterreliefs to Lyubov Popova’s
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>textile paintings. Besides, in our country the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>material” still has no equivalent in value to
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>fabric, which remains a consumer product, an
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>object of exchange.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Fabric is and yet is not a work of art. In
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>contrast to a painting — a canvas hidden under
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>layers of paint — it is a tangible, natural
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>continuation of the human body, whether as
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>clothing or part of a domestic interior. Fabric is
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>transparent and sincere. While a work of art -
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>let us say a painting — aspires to
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>immateriality, fabric is material that exhibits
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>both a semantic and a real transparency: a veil.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>A veil, being a feminine garment, creates
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a field of tension between the eye and the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>object being looked at. One can say that a veil
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>disperses the phallocentric (male) gaze, turning
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>a woman into a misty object of desire.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Sometimes it is a man who hides under the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>veil, which is how the use of a material atypical
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>for men’s art can fool a viewer. Textile is a
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>man’s chador. Text-il and text-elle are
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>interwoven into the heterogeneous fabric of this

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ideological mediation. In creating works of art
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>they give life to humans. The human being is a

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>transposition into the sphere of the tactile. The
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>readymade palace context is sensual, tactile,
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and the objects placed within it are sensual as
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>well. Palpability is arousing: the hands of

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>(of art). It is not the object of desire but desire
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>itself that turns out to be the intention of a

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Clever hands are extended toward each

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the reality of gesture. The love of art demands

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>for yours.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Clever hands liberate the object, leaving
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>only the desire. Objects of art evade the power
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>of the one who deifies/desires. Products of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>exchange (works of art and/or women) begin to
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>interact (object to object, woman to woman)
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>without the mediation of the desiring eye:
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>defetishization. An object is reflected in another
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>object as a woman is reflected in another

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pressure: a social pressure elevated by Soviet
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ideology to the status of an ideal, requiring of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>women the independence and ability to support
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>themselves and their families. An exalted
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>image of the hard-working, androgynous woman
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>became the symbol of liberation, fostering a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>conflict between the demands of national
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tradition and the realities of social life.

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>these margins — tiptoeing in the space where
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the specifically feminine phantoms of socialist
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>consciousness dwell. Working through these

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>brings out the duality of their concerns. The

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>oppression. Thus the title refers to a collective
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>complex of sorts, the symptom of which is the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>unshakable feeling that the personal, creative
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>&quot;l&quot; has been ideologically contaminated.

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>disappointed in her.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>What was she for me? At first I worshipped
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>her. Then there emerged a critical attitude, at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>times bordering on hatred. In the end I was just
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>interested. My love for her was gone long ago.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>After that I had feelings of duty, of pity, and

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>she could soar again — for she was so gifted,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>she could still do something.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>You came too late to see her as the person
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>loved, the person of the period when she lived
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in a cramped hovel in the old Moscow street
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Bolshaya Molchanovka. She was poor then,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and I would have continued to help her eagerly
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>if she had remained so. But the Devil had a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>part in all this, although Iadmit there is
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>something in me that was also present in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Korsakova: a sort of extreme, childish
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>maximalism. Basically we were very different;
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>we were similar only in our hunger for what is
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>meant by that profaned word spirituality. Art
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and Faith are not the same thing, but they have
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>a lot in common.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>It is very difficult to make a statement about
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Aleksandra Korsakova, because she managed
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to shroud herself in mystery. There was an
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>unfortunate, disgraceful scandal surrounding
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>her death and confusion surrounding the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>beginning of her artistic career. Nothing has
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>survived of what she did in the 1920s. As for
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>her works of the 1930s, I have seen some, and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>they’re skillful but lacking in the individuality
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>she developed in later years. She did a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>book graphics — poems by Anthal Gidas, all
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sorts of revolutionary stuff. Once I came across
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>newspaper clippings with her drawings of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>memorial places of the Revolution. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>extremely precise. I wouldn’t call them
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>photographic — they were much better than
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>that, just very accurate, true-to-life sketches of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>interiors and so on. Apart from her graphic
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>journal, which has always been of great interest
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>to me, she also tried at that time to do
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>illustrations to great works of literature, for
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>instance, Shakespeare’s Othello. They were no
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>good, but apparently she felt she needed to do
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>them. Korsakova had to survive a hard life with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Tatlin as well as survive the war before
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>something creative inside her woke up.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Perhaps she did some exquisite things later in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>life, but she never went any deeper than her
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Dostoyevsky series. Things like this happen
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>only once in a lifetime. Every artist evolves very
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>slowly, and for a woman it is even more
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>complicated — incredibly hard. Certainly you

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>especially those starring von Veidt, became a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>craze in Russia. All those houses, entrances,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>streets — even faces, manners, and habits —
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were purest Dostoyevsky, but it was a new art.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>In the Russia of the ’20s it was unthinkable to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>do anything of this kind, but in Germany it was
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>still possible. There it all ended in 1933.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Many films starring Veidt were shown in the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>U.S.S.R., far more than those with Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Pickford or Douglas Fairbanks. Veidt played
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>lvan the Terrible, Paganini — he starred in the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>famous Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, which was
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>neither his best role nor his best film. Women
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>here liked the antihero that he played. It was a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>case of natural hypnotism. Having starred in a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>1933 Hollywood film about Rasputin, Veidt then
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>left for Britain to play Zuss the Jew. It was in
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>this very film that Korsakova later recognized
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Tatlin’s tower in the construction of the gallows
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>on which Zuss was executed. It is impossible
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to forget the gallows and how they cut
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>diagonally into the black night sky. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>snowing, or maybe it is the stars that are falling
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>down. You can see this dreadful diagonal and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>beneath it the ascending cage with Zuss in it.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>And how Veidt cried, “Adonai”: the voice of a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>man being suffocated.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>In 1928 a second wave of emigration began
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in the U.S.S.R., and a new tide of cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>persecution rose up. The motto was “down with
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>bourgeois trash,” and under this slogan all
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>films starring Veidt, “the decadent moron, the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>aristocratic degenerate, were shelved away to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>rot somewhere in the Gosfilmofond archive.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>After the war Veidt’s talking pictures appeared,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>furnished with Russian subtitles, a gift from
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Britain. Reportedly, Stalin himself saw those
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>films, which he then banned.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>l&apos;m not a Veidt fanatic myself; it&apos;s just that
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>like true artistry wherever it may be found. It
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>was Korsakova’s first husband, Schikhman,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>who seems to have imparted humaneness to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>her and who taught her to appreciate Veidt&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>films. In a manner of speaking, this
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>appreciation is what prevented her from the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ultimate dehumanization that came to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>characterize all our dear avant-garde. Let’s look
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>the truth in the face: leftists who understood
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>film-making, like Mayakovsky, used to call Veidt
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>pseudo-psychic. They called pseudo-psychic
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>everything that had anything to do with
			</p>
			<pb n='89'/>
			<pb n='90'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>psychology. But what else was there that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>opposed the mechanistic formalism of the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>avant-garde, which told us that God is a
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>machine, that we have become machines, that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>nature is a machine, too, so the hell with
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>nature, damn all culture, let humanity be
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>confounded — and long live machines, the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>screws and the bolts!
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>You remember Popova. At the beginning she
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>is ever so alive, and at the end, on Meyerhold’s
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>stage, she is all screws and wheels, although
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her wheels were so fascinating, and they still
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>are, they seem alive. But these were the first
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>steps, and later on there was such deadness,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>such decay. Now we can see how the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>thing ended up like a cross between a morgue
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and a rubbish dump. Of course the early avant
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>gardists weren’t rubbish at all — they were
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>excellent designers. But they tore nature into
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>pieces and entirely dismembered the old
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>culture. Korsakova liked to tell stories in her
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>later years about how Tatlin studied the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>techniques of icon painting, which is true, but
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>he did so after undergoing his period of
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>persecution. Korsakova herself dangled
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>between the right and the left.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Once Korsakova told me, in an exaggerated
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>way, obviously wanting to tease me, that the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pupils of the occult philosopher Nikolai
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Fyodorov were willing to “develop” her because
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>she seemed so awfully spiritual to them but
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that she just ran away from them on her lanky
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>legs, the same way she used to escape Tatlin’s
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>courting. Tatlin and she had had a nodding
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>acquaintance back in the ’20s and ’30s, but
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>she didn’t care for him and his clumsiness. So,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the pupils of Fyodorov did their best to develop
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her soul.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Our generation — and yours, too — grew up
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>with an enormous yearning for somebody to
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>teach us, but we ended up having to dig things
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>up on our own. It was only later that l realized
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>why in my teens I was so eagerly fishing out of
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the Moscow slums the remnants of the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>prerevolutionary intelligentsia. These old men
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and women attracted me more than children
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>my own agel It seemed quite eccentric to me
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that I at the age of fourteen should share an
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>understanding with someone so ancient — not
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>with Korsakova, who was not so old at that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>time and whom I came to know much later. No,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the people l’m talking about had already died
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>by the time I met her, and they were what
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>remained of the old culture —the culture of
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>humanism, not of the machine. Korsakova
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>never sought such acquaintances. It was the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>reverse: they were seeking her. And I can
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>imagine a highbrow intellectual taking aim at
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>her with his butterfly net; I envision him as a
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>likeness of Fyodorov and her as a butterfly or a
			</p>
			<pb n='91'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>dragonfly, dancing away from him into her
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>biomechanics.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Yes, she did biomechanics in her youth. She
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>was even a dancer in Goleyzovsky’s company,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>but she was always placed in the back because
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>she was too tall. It’s very hard to judge now
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>what she was like at that time. She had a odd
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>habit, one that most women lack absolutely:
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>she did not like to speak of herself or her life.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>So l go by what she told me herself and also
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the photographs taken by her father when she
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was sixteen or seventeen, which her niece
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>showed me after Korsakova’s funeral. Iwas
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>expecting to see a girl who looked like the ’30s
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>film stars Yulia Solntseva or Tamara Makarova,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>since Korsakova had told me that people used
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>to say she resembled them. In the photographs
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>she looks a bit plain and vulgar — and
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>somewhat mincing, in keeping with the fashion
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of the early years of the century, because by
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the 1920s it was no longer fashionable to be
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>mincing or affected. I imagine Aleksandra
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Korsakova was very unserious and worldly as a
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>girl. She told me once that it was only after the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>age of forty that she first read Dostoyevsky,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and she often said that deep in her heart she
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>remained a little girl, which is very akin to my
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>own feelings. When I was twenty, people
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mistook me for a thirteen-year-old. I did my best
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to prolong my childhood, and l’ve never
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>regretted it.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Well, there was something childish in
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Korsakova, too, and the reason is that it was
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>so early that she lost her innocence — literally,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>not in any higher sense. It must have happened
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>when she was something like fourteen or
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sixteen. Starting at age fourteen she was
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>hanging around the theater, leading a grown-up
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>life with a retinue of admirers, even though she
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>was a mere child, even physically. I suspect
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that she was absolutely cool and rather cruel
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>toward men. Later in her life she grew softer; in
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>her youth, however, it seems she was pitiless,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>but they had only themselves to blame for that.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Also, she never had children, and these two
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>circumstances combined seem to have created
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>excruciating nostalgia — not so much for
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>having a child of her own but rather for having
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>lost her own childhood too much before the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>natural time. The little girl of her drawings was
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>not grief about a motherhood that was not to
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>be but rather about her own childhood, which,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>by the way, was not at all unhappy. She was a
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>spoiled baby. She loved to boast that her
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ancestors were Old Believers, but she gave up
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>her patriarchal family just the way other silly
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>little talented fools of her generation did.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Korsakova must have realized what she
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>really was when she sprained her foot and had
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>to give up dancing. Her legs had worked too
			</p>
			<pb n='92'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>hard, while her brain had been idle. The
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>enforced end of her career as a dancer helped
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her become an artist. People — especially
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women — gain wisdom due to circumstances,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>you know. Korsakova also worked as a theatel
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>designer, which she began to do after she met
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Tatlin — after 1940, maybe earlier. They did
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>stage design and costumes. Ibelieve this was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>a job done mainly under orders, during the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>darkest period of our history. Take, for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>example, Aleksandr Kron’s Deep
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Reconnaissance, a very conformist Socialist
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Realist play. Tatlin was responsible for the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stage design and Korsakova for the costumes.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Men did,influence Korsakova artistically, but
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>by and large they were in the way, and their
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ailments, especially, brought burdens. Even
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>though she was always a gifted artist, she

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>died. It is impossible to guess the extent to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>which she depended upon him and whether or
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>not he was her idol, as everyone says he was.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>l’m afraid that if he was, he became so only
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>after his death. Her memories of him were
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>highly contradictory; some of them shocked me
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>as being rude and cynical. Her flashes of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>cynicism did not become her, and though they
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>were rare, they were bitter and spiteful.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Sometimes she vented apologetic
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>recollections, but mainly in the presence of a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>third party; sometimes she talked about good
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>memories that were just very human and very
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>nice.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Once she called me to help her deal with her
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>canvases in the storeroom, and before I arrived
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>she took some kind of medicine or liquor and,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>just to tease me, started pretending that she
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>was more drunk than she actually was. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>curious, but it was also frightening. Iwas
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>shocked. She was stumbling along behind the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>wall, stopping now and then at the door of the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>storeroom and muttering deliriously, in a very
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Dostoyevskian way, “Ah, where are they all?
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>wish some of them were here! Vadimir
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Yevgrafovich, at least ...&quot; The worst thing about
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>it was her manner: simple, sweet, and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>horrifying all at the same time, like falling in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>love with somebody no longer living.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>As for Veidt, it’s such a pity that he never
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>played anything of Dostoyevsky’s. His
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>popularity was enormous, but now he is
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>forgotten, and this shows how degraded the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>masses have become since the beginning of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>the century. Everywhere there reigns what
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Dostoyevsky referred to as “the street&quot; and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the mediocre.&quot; The lower you fall, the closer
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>you are to your idol. It’s like Hitler and Charlie
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Chaplin — now nobody can tell which of them
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>played whom.

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>interview with her vanished mysteriously, as we

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Korsakova began as an artist of the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>younger avant-garde generation, and it was the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>avant-garde that professionally baptized her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>&quot;Korsakova, the wife of Tatlin.” Several articles,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>published after a prolonged period of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>nonrecognition, have now managed to secure a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>place for her away from the shadow of her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ingenious husband. “The world was trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>catch me, but it didn’t, said a sage in his
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>autoepitaph. Korsakova’s suicide was an act of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>final self-identification with the old Russian
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>avant-garde. The revolt of the daughter who
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>produced her most original works only after her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>physical tie with the legendary era was broken,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>as of Tatlin’s (and Stalin’s) death in 1953,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ended in a dignified acknowledgement of her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>defeat by the mainstream. She was constantly
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>yearning to change something, whether it was
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the place she lived in or the studio she worked
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in. In the long run Korsakova chose another,

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The Conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Q. Women’s art is usually understood to arise from
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the purely corporeal difference of sex. But we are
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>interested in differences in the spiritual nature of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women’s artistic self-realization and whether these
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>differences become manifest in art.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>A. Yes, they do, and now they are more
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>significant than in any other period. The most
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>important thing for the woman artist nowadays
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>is first and foremost her child, her motherhood
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>— bearing a child, cherishing a child. A woman
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>dreams of herself in her child; she makes her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>art as she bears an infant. I know a young
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>painter who decided to have a child and is
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>raising him all by herself. She’s having a hard
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>time, because her son is not physically strong,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and she has to work a lot to provide for her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>child and herself. But she looks happy. Yes,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>there can be different circumstances in life, but
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>it would take us too far afield if we explore that
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>in detail. What I am speaking about now is the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>most general trend: that the formative factor for
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the contemporary Russian woman artist is
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>her child.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>In fact, an artist always remains a child
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>deep inside. I still feel the childhood in myself
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>as if l were a little girl in the arms of my
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>parents or out in the countryside in spring.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>made a series of drawings in which the main
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>character is a little girl living in a city during
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>wartime, sitting in an air raid shelter and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>dreaming of herself as Joan of Arc. This girl is
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>also me, and in my heart I am still like her.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Back in the twenties everything was so
			</p>
			<pb n='95'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>very different. Everybody, men and women
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>artists alike, were equally charged with the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>energy of the time. It was a miraculous period.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>All doors were wide open. There was an
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>incredible degree of inner freedom. At that time
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>artists were never labeled as men or women.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Rather, you saw that some of them were
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>artists, while others were mere designers.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Tatlin, for instance, was a true artist. Later
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>there came to be more and more designers,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>while artists grew rarer. Still, at the beginning
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>no one fenced off the women artists. At that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>time there was nothing of that sort being done.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>But basically so many things were not the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>way they are now. Conditions were entirely
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>different. At that time everyday life was not
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ruined to the extent it is now. Women were not
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>so aware of their femininity. It worried nobody if
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>a woman artist had children or not, or if she
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>took her children with her or left them and went
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>away alone.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Nor was there a question of artistic
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>influence for us. We were all independent
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>artists, all on our own. Goncharova, for
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>example, was a very good artist, much stronger
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>than Larionov, though many people disagree.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>remember having been to their place severa
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>times. He would jokingly try to discipline her,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>but he could never influence her creative
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>personality. As for me, I was no one’s pupil,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>although I did attend classes, first under
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Mashkov and then under Ulyanov and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Konchalovsky. Tatlin and I did work together but
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>were independent of each other. I was not his
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>follower. So there wasn’t such a thing as being
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>someone’s pupil at that time.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Q. However, in discussing, say, Popova, mention is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>always made of her having been a pupil of Malevich.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Do you think she was talented enough to have
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>established an art movement of her own?
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>A. Of course. She was an absolutely excellent
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>artist.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N043'/>Q. Aleksandra Nikolayevna, one sometimes gets the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N044'/>impression — though it is impossible to prove —
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N045'/>that those in power were trying to control creative
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N046'/>women by blackmailing them with the well-being and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N047'/>security of their children. This was the case with
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N048'/>Akhmatova and, to some extent, with Tzvetayeva as
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N049'/>well. Did you feel that having children at that time
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N050'/>was simply dangerous?
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N051'/>A. That is very true. This was how it was. What
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N052'/>l’ve been talking about so far was the surface
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N053'/>of life, but deep inside it was tragic. ..

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>they were taken down from public displays.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Well, what of it? I reveled in my work again.

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>see? I was staying at an artists’ retreat in the

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>living. I could not bring myself to look into their
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>eyes. I just ran away. It was unbearable to see
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>so much suffering, such misfortune, and yet at
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the same time such divine beauty. Dear God,

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>﻿4. 1 graduated from the Institute of Architecture.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>Artistic education has done me no harm, though
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N013'/>it can do harm if a person is unable to see and
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N014'/>think independently and grows into the structure,
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N015'/>losing their own identity and becoming part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>system.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N017'/>My professional surroundings are amorphous and
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N018'/>inconstant. There are uneven edges and an
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N019'/>unsound core, and mostly chance contacts with
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N020'/>chance people — poets, artists, philosophers,

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N025'/>advice, lusually ignore it.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N026'/>Once a man who did occult science advised me
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N027'/>to give up doing my objects altogether, as they
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N028'/>reminded him of magic devices that can affect
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N029'/>the metaphysical spheres with unpredictable
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N030'/>results. He also advised me against abstract
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N031'/>painting, which he thought of as “theurgic
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N032'/>magic.&quot; Of course, 1 continue to design my
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N033'/>objects, but the occultist’s advice was not lost on
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N034'/>me. It helped me understand the connection
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N035'/>between art and magic, to see clearly the
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N036'/>direction of contemporary art and my own way.I
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N037'/>realized that the artist who, with God’s help,
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N038'/>recognizes universal aesthetic laws can
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N039'/>penetrate such depths and create such things
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N040'/>(for the well-being of the people, incidentally) that
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N041'/>even an occultist has neither time nor fantasy
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N042'/>enough to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N043'/>Now 1 am developing safety measures for
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N044'/>interacting with my objects. I am stricter now in
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N045'/>my approach to the screening structures that

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N048'/>So, there can be no advice that would be
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N049'/>completely unacceptable.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N050'/>It is difficult for me to give an exact name for
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N051'/>The style or trend or genre 1 work in. There are

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>surrounded by ruins, he began to rebuild the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>spiritual traditions of his family. He became an
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>author and created a library that included many
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>books on art, and it was he who instilled me with
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a sense of duty, the duty to continue. Writers

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>any concrete teacher that determined my choice
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of painting. Certainly my father was my teacher in

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>become successful is hopeless. In any situation
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>people are ready to view you as a woman but
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>never as an artist or a person. Maybe I was not

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>environment at all. A feeling of professional
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>loneliness has followed me all these years.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The eighties, after I graduated from college, were
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>hard for me. I wanted to exhibit, to work with all

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>must add to personal qualities, not vice versa.

				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Among the artists who surround me there are
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>both men and women, though I have met gifted
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>women more often than gifted men I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>know why.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>cannot always understand and accept other
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>people’s advice, because I don’t know for sure
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>myself what it is l’m doing. I can only feel it.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>do not confine myself to the framework of a
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>direction or style, and I would not like anybody to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>do so. First of all, I don’t think it is important, and
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in addition, we are all on our own, though
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sometimes I feel like finding a harbor of some
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>kind.

				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Born 1950 Moscow
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Graduate of Surikov Art College
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cannot say that l had a First Teacher, a One and
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Only. At art school l worked under Tatyana
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Selvinskaya. All of us at that time were working
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>à la Selvinskaya. She was a master. Later on one
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>overcomes the master’s influence and works on
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>one’s own. When I was at college I studied under
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Mikhail Mikhailovich Kurilko. He was an art
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>collector and a person of genuine culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>remember the cultural atmosphere that he
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>created around himself.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>In principle, inspiration does not come from a
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>person but from a philosophy, especially that
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>which derives from literature. I love Dostoyevsky;
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>admire the transparent abyss that opens up
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>beyond the world of his characters.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>My father was not an artist, and though there
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>were sculptors in the family, I did not live in an
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>artistic milieu when I was a little girl. But my
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>father was very attentive to my childhood
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>attempts at art; he even had a folder to put my
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>drawings in. It was through him that I first sensed
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the spirit of art. Now that I have a circle of my
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>own, my friends are mostly artists, but when
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>work I do not take their opinion into account.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Other people are always a nuisance.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>All my works are different. My critics would like to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>see more stylistic homogeneity in my paintings,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>but l am afraid that that might turn out to be
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>merely an artistic device. I also feel strongly
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>influenced by stage design. When I worked at the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>theater l always had to deal with drama written
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>according to differing individual laws, with
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>different directors. You cannot keep using the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>same device when you work with different
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>themes.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>People sometimes say that there is light in some
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of my works, while others are all darkness. To me
			</p>
			<pb n='105'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the light seems somewhat dubious. A person
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>exists beyond the everyday world, the inner
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>person that no one can see.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The most “oedipal,&quot; the most “twilight&quot; of my
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>paintings can be traced back to absolutely
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>concrete, everyday experiences. Here is a witch
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and her insane son. I saw with my own eyes how
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>he suffered when he tried on a sweater she had
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>knit for him, how he cut into pieces a shirt she
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>had given him. Or the portrait of a friend of mine,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>who often modeled for me. I painted her face in
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>different moods. Then she went abroad to live,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and when I went to see her in her new home, we
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>suddenly quarreled. I was bored at the prospect
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of just painting her portrait, so l covered her face
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with a pink balloon. These are all very personal
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>situations, but they become part of the world and
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>also recognizable when I make them into
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>pictures. Thus a friend of mine recognized a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>reference to Hamlet as soon as he saw my
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>picture Sweater for the Son.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Natalya TURNOVA
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Born 1957 Kabul, Afghanistan
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Graduate of Stroganov Art School
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I I did not have a teacher at all, but a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>influences.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>2. My family’s attitude did not play any role in my
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>choice of profession. Nobody expected me to be
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>an artist, but later on, my mother gave me
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>support in whatever I did. Without her help I could
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>have been a failure.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>4. I believe artistic environment influences the artist
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>rather strongly. As a rule, without the influence,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>what one does comes out archaic, timeless, and
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>addressing nobody.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>5. As for general professional advice, it does not
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>exist. Advice that is worth considering is concrete
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in every case. I simply forget all the rest. Any
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>advice is useful, because someone has taken
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the trouble to think for you. It remains only to see
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>if it is correct or not.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>7. As for genre or style, I try to abstain from self
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>identification as long as possible, to leave myself
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the illusion of freedom to do what l like.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Political portraiture for me is an attempt to join a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>concrete impression of the contemporary world
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>with an individual approach to each face. My
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>method is to use traditional painting, meaning
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the tone, color, texture, brushwork — whatever
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the viewer would like to see.
