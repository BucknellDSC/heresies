				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>called art can have a political impact and that in the making of art and all
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cultural artifacts our identities as women play a distinct role. We hope that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>theory, as well as generate new creative energies among women. It will be a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to broadening
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>HERESIES is published by a collective of feminists, some of whom are also
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists; our fields include paint
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>architecture, filmmaking, photography, and video. While the themes of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>individual issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>different editorial staff, composed of women who want to work on that issue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>as well as members of the collective. HERESIES provides experience for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women who work editorially, in design, and in production. An open evalua
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tion meeting will be held after the appearance of each issue. HERESIES will
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>try to be accountable to and in touch with the international feminist com
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>munity.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lives, our arts, and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>are clarified, they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tween artist and audience, and to understand the relationship between art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and politics, work and workers. As a step toward the demystification of art,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art within the present
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because they are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>nor to the competitive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art.

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Most of the women in the world live their lives in silence.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Silence, as the consequence of biology, as the reality for us
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>under the patriarchy. Our lives, our deeds go for the most part
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>unrecorded, unnoticed, unheeded.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Yet this silence itself is a kind of noise, a definite process
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in the life of the world. We can choose to become silent as a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>means of commentary or protest, or be forced into silence as
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a means of oppression. There is also a third way: the silence
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of women who in their everydayness present mute testimony

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>is always an attempt to achieve that unity. But is it possible to

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>as written by the playwright, a kind of meaning that would be

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tions are part of my continual exploration in the theater: the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>question of identity for the Black bourgeoisie and the reality

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ductions. The place that she works is La
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Cartoucherie, which is an old munitions
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>factory outside of Paris. They do enor
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>mous pieces, with maybe 100 people
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and the audience moving around; anc
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>now she’s finished a whole film of Mo
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lière; and she&apos;s doing, I think, some
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Shakespearean things in a Japanese
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>kind of style. She does very epic kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>productions. ...She’s very special. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>work is beautiful. So that’s another per
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>son who’s working that way.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Myself—the thing that&apos;s strange
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>about it is that as l&apos;m getting older l&apos;m
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>wanting to work smaller. I went to Ber
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>lin in 1980 and did Vessel again on a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>company in Berlin, and had 150 Cer
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>man extras for the third section, that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>outdoor piece. And I found myself not
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>very interested in it. It’s a nice piece;
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>know that it’s great for an audience to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>see all the armies and motorcycles and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>all that, but as a working process
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>found myself not interested at all.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>actually prefer working with people
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>more closely, and I was much more
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>excited about working with 12 actors of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that company and seeing what hap
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>pened in the process. It was more grati
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fying, on a human level, than having
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>150 strangers to deal with. I guess
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>don’t need that kind of size to feel my
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>power. I don’t really think that’s a rea
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>son why! did it in the first place; it had
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>much more to do with a kind of vision
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>But as a process l enjoy working smaller.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Do you think that’s a factor when some
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>people work large-scale—that they
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>need size to feel their power?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>It could be. It could be that sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>in your life you have to have that kind
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>of expansive energy to be able to in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>clude a lot. Now, l’m more interested in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>a kind of depth rather than a breadth.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>And from the last large piece that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>did—Specimen I realized that in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>the act of performing there’s something
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that&apos;s less pleasurable for me. If l’m that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>dependent on other elements, I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that the human element is not as strong.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>l’m much more interested in just know
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing that either I do a bad performance
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>or a good performance, or the people
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that are working do a bad performance
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>or a good performance, and that de
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cides whether it’s a good performance
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>or not—not whether a light comes on or
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a projector comes on or this comes on
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>or that comes on.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>To me, that was always what was so
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>miraculous—that you were able to do a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>good performance and deal with all
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>these elements. Not just the number of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>people, but all the elements you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dealing with—visual and sound..
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>l’m still dealing with those elements;
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>it’s just a smaller scale. The piece that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>l’m working on now still has film in it.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>l’m writing the whole score and working
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>on the movement and working on the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>images and working on the costumes.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Its still as multidimensional, but it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>just that l enjoy having a rehearsal with
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>six or seven or eight people that I know,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and that l’ve been working with for a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>long time. There’s a certain kind of lan
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>guage that&apos;s been built up over the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>years—rather than have 50 people I can
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tell to do something very simple, and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>it&apos;s very stunning to look at, but I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>know them. It also may have a lot to do
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>with our time now. Because in the days
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>that I did do pieces with large groups it
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>was a real communal kind of thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>People would come and their kids
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>would be in the show, and that kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>thing, which I loved very much. But in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Germany I had a much different feel
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ing. They were hired; 100 or 150 people
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>were hired. And that was a very differ
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ent kind of feeling than it used to be
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>here. It’s much harder to achieve that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>now, because people don’t really have
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the time and the energy to do it.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>It may just be that l’m refining anc
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>pulling my scale down so that l’II open
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>back out again. That&apos;s another thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>think that you can’t just go on doing
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>piece after piece after piece in the same
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>form. You have to keep on questioning
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>what you’re doing and try to be as fresh
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>as you can.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>One of the things about you being one
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>of the few women in the world working
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>on a large scale is that you then become
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>a role model for women, because they
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>don’t see any women doing it. It just
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>doesn’t occur to you sometimes when
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>you don’t see anyone else doing it. For
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>me, when I was working with you, and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was at the time working on my very first
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>piece, I know that was a really impor-
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tant factor—that I saw you direct this
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>project, and so it didn’t seem unnatural
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for me to do that. Just seeing you up
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>there saying, &quot;l like this; I don&apos;t like
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that, made it seem so simple and so
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>realizable that I didn’t really think twice
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>—&quot;Oh, can I be in that position? Am I
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>good enough? Do l have enough experi
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ence? Do l have to be better than all the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>people who are in it?&quot; I just saw you
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>doing it and that was really important.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>So what is that like for you? Do you feel
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a burden?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Ruth Malaczech talked about that too.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>One woman asked her, “What are the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>issues that would occur to you around
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>this issue of Heresies?&quot; And she said,“
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>can’t stand being everyone’s mother all
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the time. How do you feel about that?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Some of these people think l’m just as
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>much their father as l am their mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>OK, so how do you feel about being
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>their father?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>That does get very tiring. Because you
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>do realize as you go along that with a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>lot of things that happen, there&apos;s a kind
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>of illusion that&apos;s built up, and people
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>don’t realize that that’s what’s in play.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>always, myself, try to avoid that. I think
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Itry to break down those illusions. If
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>see that someone is reacting to me that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>way, l’II throw in a monkey wrench.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>remember there were a lot of times
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>people did a saint thing to me, because
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>they thought I played Joan of Arc and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sol had to be a saint. I would eliminate
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that illusion immediately.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Well, that’s what bothered me about
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>directing: I always felt like I had to be
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>perfect, and I was just figuring things
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>out. And I felt like I couldn’t complain
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and! couldn’t be weak and that l had to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>solve everyone’s problems and be a per
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>fect example, and it was really a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>pressure. I didn’t like that role.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>l’ve been working just about 20 years
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>now, and the way that I see it, it&apos;s just
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>somehow trying to keep going. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>about as far as I can go. As l’m getting
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>older, l’m trying to be much more sen
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>sitive to those kind of things, even in an
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>individual rehearsal. Just to nip them in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>the bud, so to speak. Because I see
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>how, especially if you’ve been working
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>with people for a long time, these pat
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_6_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>terns form.

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>itself a feminist magazine, I had to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>define for myself what that was, which
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>l’d never really done before. One thing
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that occurred to me, which is maybe a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cliche, is that women are more comfor
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>table with dealing on an unconscious
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>level, not always a rational level. They
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>don’t really need to constantly articu
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>late to themselves what it is theyre
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>doing and why. To me that’s one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>strengths of your work and work that
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>really reaches down to a lot of people
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>deeply. Somehow you’re able to tap
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>your unconscious and you’re comforta
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ble with not knowing all the time what
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>you’re doing.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>l’ve been finding, the more that l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>been working, that if I can give myself
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the time, even in the rehearsal process,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to slow down enough to really let my
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>intuition operate, that&apos;s when l’m at my
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>best. In a way l’m becoming more intui
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tive as I go along. I really know when
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>lm off now. It’s really a thing of giving
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>myself enough time in a rehearsal, and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>not feeling pressured: that I can give
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>myself that time to change mode, to get
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>back to that place where the intuitive
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>thing comes out. And it’s usually right.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>l’m actually going more in that direc
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tion.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>So that’s something that you’re con
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>scious of, and that you have control of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>—how to keep yourself...
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Ido and I don&apos;t. If l’m working well, l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>conscious of it. If l’m working badly,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>can’t help myself—that l’m intellectu
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>alizing everything. It just depends on
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>how connected I am. In this particular
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>thing that l’m working on I have
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to really almost stop the rehearsal, to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>just stop enough to get what the next
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>thing is. Then my voice or my body tells
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>me what the next thing is. And I think a
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>lot of times people—and I don’t know if
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it’s just women—really have a hard
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>time trusting that part of themselves. A
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lot of it is just stopping enough to let
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that exist, not just putting this editor up
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>right away and having a judge in the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>mind, cutting it off too fast. That takes
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a little doing.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Right. Because, in the rehearsal pro
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cess, in order to have that happen, you
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>have to sort of slosh through some stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that might really look terrible, but you
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>might have a sense that it could lead
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>somewhere. Most people don’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tolerance for that, because it has to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>look perfect and presentable from the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>start.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>But I think that&apos;s a learning process
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>through one&apos;s life. I don&apos;t think you
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>actually ever achieve that. Or you might
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>achieve it for one piece, and the next
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>one you go right back to the bad habits
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of doing what you said, which is that it
			</p>
			<pb n='12'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>has to look perfect right off the bat. It
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>takes a lot of time to learn how to give
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>yourself permission to do that. With
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>this form that l’m working on now,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>basically I think the form is right, but
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>there’s a lot of stuff that&apos;s going to have
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to be filled in or changed and this or
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that. But l’m allowing the form to exist
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>right now. I do it over and over again
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>until the little things start spreading
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>out. Or filling out. But that&apos;s not neces
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sarily the way that it happens all the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>time. Sometimes I also panic and get
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>into that perfectionist thing right away,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and then ruin a piece.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Well, that’s encouraging to know, that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>you can slide back and then get there
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>again.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Ithink it’s not that linear a process.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Unfortunately. Because you&apos;d think
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>once you&apos;d learned that lesson, that&apos;s it
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>for the rest of your working life. And it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>not true. It depends on what kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>state you’re in when you’re working.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Well, one thing the women on Heresies
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>wanted to ask you about was archaeol
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ogy. I thought maybe it had to do with
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>this whole thing of getting down to your
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>unconscious, being able to use your
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>unconscious as a mode of functioning.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>And archaeology is such a metaphor.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Freud always talks about archaeology
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>as a metaphor for psychoanalysis.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Does he? Sorry.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>l’ve never really been conscious of using
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>archaeology as subject matter until
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Recent Ruins, where I really was using
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>it as a theme. But l always have been
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>aware of trying to uncover things that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>have always existed. I always feel that if
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>l’m working well, that the form exists,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and it&apos;s just a matter of finding it and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>allowing it to tell me what to do. When
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>1feel like l’m working well, that&apos;s what
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the process feels like, more than it feels
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>like me inventing. And that’s really like
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>archaeology; it’s sort of like discov
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ering
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>The pots are already there—
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Right. It’s discovery as a mode of crea
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tion. You could say it’s an older mode
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of the idea of creation than the way
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>post-industrial people think of creation.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Because the pre-industrial idea of crea
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tion did have a lot to do with using
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>what was already there. Whereas the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>post-industrial revolution idea is that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>you invent something new to fit a func
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tion. You don’t use this table as a hat. If
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you need a hat, you make a new hat.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>But l like the idea of using the table as a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>hat. That&apos;s much more the way that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>work, which some people have called
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>primitive&quot;—but I say that with big
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>quotation marks.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>love the idea of archaeology. That
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>you have a civilization, and then over
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that is another civilization, and over
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that is another civilization, and over
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>that is another civilization. It&apos;s in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>credible.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The other yeally broad subject I was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>thinking of is this whole business of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>working multimedia. You don’t just do
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that by chance. There&apos;s some kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>commitment there.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>think for me it’s been a psychic neces
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sity. Even through my childhood and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>late adolescence. I was very dedicated
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>in the dance field, when I was 18 or 19.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>took two or three classes a day, that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>kind of thing. But I also was singing,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and I was also composing music, and it
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>never felt right that I would just go and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>be a physical specimen. That’s really
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>what dance was about at that time.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Physicality as a source of creation never
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>interested me. For some people it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>right; for me it was wrong. Integrating a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>lot of different elements that I was in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>terested in, and was always interested
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>in, became a way of integrating myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>That I could try to use as much of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>myself as I can. And that&apos;s always been
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>howI felt; you should use anything you
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>have.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>There was a guy that came up to me
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>when I was in Berlin, who was in a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>wheelchair, who had been in a bad car
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>accident. And he said he was going to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>do a piece in a wheelchair. He had
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>heard that I had said to somebody, who
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>had told him, &quot;Use everything you
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>have. And so he was going to do a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>piece about his accident, in the wheel
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>chair. And that just seemed great to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>me. Really, you owe it to yourself and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to everybody else to use as many cen
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I would call it centers, or parts of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>yourself—as possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>More people are doing that now, but
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>there&apos;s still an enormous amount of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>pressure
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>To be in one field—
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>To specialize in one thing. That you’re a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>better artist if you just specialize.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Yeah, I have a lot of pressure from the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>officials and the government. I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>get included in history books; because
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>l’m more than one thing, l’m not in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cluded. It’s as if l’m not serious enough.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>In a way, you have to be even more
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>serious, or more brave.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>But, on the other hand, I feel that ours
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is again—l keep going back to this
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>&quot;primitive” people thing—but I feel like
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ours is the only culture that separates
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>its functions that much. In cultures that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>exist now and ancient culture, what
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>would call the three main elements of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>performing—which are dance, theater,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and music—were pretty much integrat
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ed within each person. Storytelling,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>music, and dance were always done as
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>one thing, not three separate things....
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>But now there’s a whole field that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>called performance art. Richard Schech
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ner said last week, while I was doing a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>workshop, &quot;Before performance art,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>there was Meredith Monk.&quot; Well, in a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>certain way, it’s true. I could never
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>think of what I could call myself. And1
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>still don’t know what to call myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Are you happy about that—&quot;perfor
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>mance art&quot;?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Not exactly. l’ve never been able to find
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>any way of saying what I do. If a cab-

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Yes, I still do.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Did you have to really work hard at

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Iguess that the way I dealt with it was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>that I ignored it for a long time, and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>then it got so bad that I was totally

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>visible in the world. Maybe not raising
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>money...
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Yeah. I always had a feeling which I still
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>have—that one can do business and try
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to be as good a human being as possible
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>at the same time. That&apos;s very important
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to me. I would never want to submit
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>myself to a business mentality, at the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>expense of my work. I know a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>times l’ve been lax about the business
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>end of it. As much as it seems to you
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that I haven’t, I have been. l’ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>kind of a mess on that level—real disor
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ganized. But I really have felt much
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>better doing it this way. I don’t think
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that I would do very well with a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>pressure—like doing a Broadway show
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>or something like that. I really like to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>have my own sort of world that l’m cre
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ating, on my own terms, and in my own
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>time. And that means maybe that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>won’t have as big audiences and be as
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sellable. But l really do want to have my
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>own integrity and have my own work be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the way that I want it to be.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>That’s one of the remarkable things
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>you really have an air of integrity.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Usually, observing people who are suc
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>cessful in the art world, we just don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>find that—that it&apos;s really important to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>this person to be a human being at all
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>times.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>It’s really important to me. The other
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>thing that I try to do very much is to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>keep myself in a risk situation, which is
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>not what a lot of people like to do
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Sometimes it makes me mad at myself;
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>I sometimes am also very ambivalent
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and confused. If I could turn out the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>same shirt every time, people would
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>like me a lot better. And then some
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>times I feel, &quot;She has this big show, and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>how come I I go through all
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>that stuff too. But then when I go back
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>again to my real self, I think, I really
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>do want to try to risk, in every show,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>doing something new for myself. Ever
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>if people can’t keep up with that, I just
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>want to try to do that.&quot; And that is
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>much more difficult on the selling/
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>marketplace kind of level; but for me,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>it’s the only thing that keeps me going.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Frankly, it’s the only thing that keeps
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>me alive. It may be just a temperament
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>thing; it may be that other people are
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>kept alive because they feel more se
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cure—about doing the same form over
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and over again. But I get so thrilled
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>when I feel like l’m pushing myself into
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>something else.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>There are enough people out there who
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>want to see you experimenting. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>one who is at your level with your
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>career, still experimenting, is almost
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>totally unheard of.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>That’s what I want to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Well, that has to do with the last thing!
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wanted to ask you. You once said to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>me, “Ambition will be the death of us
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Yeah, it&apos;s true.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>What are the dangers of ambition? What
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>are the dangers of being successful?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>think l’ve been very afraid and leery
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>about success, because l’ve actually
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>seen what happens to people when they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>have a lot of success. For me, the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of having creative energy is all I can ask
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>for, and I know that when l’m given
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that kind of energy l’m blessed. Now if
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>have that, I hardly could ask for any
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>thing else. I think my sister said this to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>me once: Real ambition is really the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ambition to do a good piece. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>good ambition. But a lot of other stuff,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ambition in terms of the world—I mean,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>you have to have some of that, so that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>you’re not going to just do pieces in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>your own bathtub; you have to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>little of that just to have the courage to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>get out there at all—but I think that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>when that starts taking over, the crea
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tive thing dries up. That&apos;s what l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>observed. And it’s too much pressure.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>You get into a kind of whirlwind of pres
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>sure, and the work suffers very much.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>And then theré’s a lot of pressure from
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the people around you, saying, &quot;You
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>should be more ambitious.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Yes, that’s right, especially people in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the company. They want you to be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ambitious and have more money and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>all that stuff. For myself, if I start
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>getting too carried away by trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>figure out what my place in the world
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>is, I think I lose my essence.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>You start getting jealous.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Yeah, it’s a real waste of time. I found
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that for myself. It might be, for other
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>people, that they need to have that to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>keep on going—l really do think it
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>comes down to what your relationship
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to yourself is. And how much life gets
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>into the work.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Do you think that there’s a different
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>generation of people that have a much
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>different relationship to this ambition
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>thing than we have? Because sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Ithink that l’m more like a dinosaur in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>terms of thinking about these things.I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>think there is a generation of people
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>who are really really ambitious, period.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>It’s not even a question; that’s it.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Yes, and it’s really frightening to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>But I really do think that if you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>getting the energy and the information,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>youre just blessed. It’s nothing that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>anybody could ever take away from
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>you. You know if you have it or you
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>don’t have it. I don&apos;t think anything can
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>replace that. That’s the only reason for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>doing it. Because after a while, OK,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>you’ve worked 20 years or 25 years, OK,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>so you’ve got this many grants, this
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>many pieces you’ve done, you’ve got
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>this long a résumé, you have these peo

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ple that love you, you’ve done this
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>piece, that piece, this piece, that piece,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>this piece, that piece, this piece, that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>piece, and then you go to your grave
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>And what do you think you have—a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>piece of paper that tells you all the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>pieces that you’ve done? So what? The
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>only reason for doing it is that you
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>might have the joy of that kind of dis
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>covery on a day-to-day level. The only
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>reason for doing it is really that you
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>love doing it. And I say this very seri
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ously, having really gone through a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>of pain, a lot of bitterness, a lot of this
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and a lot of that, and really really trying
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>to figure out why l’m doing it. And
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>really don’t see any reason for doing it
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>except just that llove to do it. Because,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>otherwise, in the universe, it&apos;s mean
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>ingless. It’s fine that some people are
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>enriched by it, and that you are giving,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>in a way, everything that you have for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>other people and for your own fulfill
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>ment. But still, it’s pretty meaningless
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>in the overall big scheme of things.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>What it gets down to is: How do you

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Pina Bausch is the director of the Wuppertaler Tanztheater,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>which has gained international fame for its unique blend of
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>theater and dance. It began about ten years ago as a ballet
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>company attached to the opera house in Wuppertal, West
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Germany. At first Bausch choreographed ballets, but soon she
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>began to work on modern operas like Bartok’s Bluebeard and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>plays like Macbeth, adapting them for dancers. Then she
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>started to create her own plays, loosely collecting improvised
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>scenes around a given theme. Bausch’s plays are nonlinear
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and deal with dreams and desires, associations and fantasies;
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the dancers/authors invent stories and actions that reveal
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>their personal lives as well as a kind of collective unconscious.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>What follow are excerpts from a report on rehearsals for
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Kontakthof, with which I assisted for four weeks.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The rehearsals take place in the “Lichtburg,” a remodeled
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>movie theater with old-fashioned lamps; a narrow stage in
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>front of the screen, a row of chairs before it, a piano in the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>corner; the floor covered with a dance rug. (The stage set will
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>later have a similar structure.) There are twenty dancers: nine
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women in pink rehearsal dresses, eleven men in suits. As most
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of them are foreigners—from twelve different nations—Eng
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lish is spoken primarily.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>This is the third week of rehearsal for a piece that does not yet
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>exist. Instead, there are themes: “tenderness,” &quot;desire,&quot;“

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>decisions easier; rather, harder. Pina Bausch has never been

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Deadly Sins, or Macbeth, she always made something of her
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>own out of it—something that distanced itself greatly from
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the original and yet, in spite of it or because of it, was very
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>close to the original. Here everything must be fantasized with

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>its characters.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The rehearsals are relaxed and disciplined. They start with an
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>hour of classical ballet training, followed by work on the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>piece, which means gathering material. Pina suggests move
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ments, specifies themes for improvisation. “Let&apos;s do some
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>thing with our complexes,” she says. &quot;We all have complexes,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>so let’s demonstrate them. Everyone show what they don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>like about their bodies. She puts on blaring circus music. The
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>dancers cross the room; stop in the middle; hide double chins
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>or wide hips, a nose too big or breasts too small. The tall ones
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>make themselves shorter; the short ones, taller. They exit with
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the frozen gesture; return with it on the next go-round, adding
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>a new “complex.&quot; This is repeated four times, until they can
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hardly move for all the contortions they must make to hide
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>their &quot;faults.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Interestingly, what the individual finds unattractive, others
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>find beautiful. It is striking that the women are much more
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>composed and honest with this exercise than the men are
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and therefore &quot;better.” (In the final piece “The Complexes

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sent themselves as if before a jury. They show themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>from the front, the back, in profile; present their foreheads
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and teeth, their hands and the soles of their feet. Their seri
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ousness and concentration, along with the slow, kitschy mu
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sic, make this self-presentation look very sad. Associations:
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>auditioning, offering oneself, being vulnerable on stage and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in life, slave-shows, prostitution, sell-outs.

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to each other. They sit far apart and undress slowly, shyly.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>They smile at each other and are ashamed. It is a very tender
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>scene, touching... like two children who are curious and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>afraid
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>The &quot;Parade of Complexes” is a form of presentation, too. As
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>is an exercise that is later dropped: showing parts of oneself
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the shoulder blade, the little finger, the navel. Presentation
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>also means couples who give instruction on inflicting pain,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>demonstrating with the routine gestures of a tired vaudevilli
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>an how to best poke each other in the eye or twist an ear. The
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>gentleman offers his arm, the lady takes it, and they return to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>their seats — elegant, polite married couples, accompanied by
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>schmaltzy music and the applause of the ensemble. This exer
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>cise is called “Aggressive Tenderness.&quot; Then there is “The
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Museum”: everyone stands around as if at a party, until some
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>one falls down, throws up, smashes against the wall. The
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>others watch, indifferent or interested, as if looking at a work
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of art instead of a person.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Pina allows a lot of time to try things out. She doesn’t inter
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>rupt the dancers, but allows everyone to live out the fantasy,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>even if something is all wrong. In this phase of rehearsal, the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>activity lies in the dancers&apos; determining if, how, and with
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>whom they want to carry through an improvisation. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>times they digress and lose themselves, thereby giving the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>stimulus for a new theme.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>For me, this kind of work is more collective than what is usu
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ally called that. The mutual exchange and inspiration, the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>enjoyment and spontaneity remind me of rehearsals I saw at
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the Théâtre du Soleil in Paris. Perhaps it is not a coincidence
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>that the directors of both groups, Ariane Mnouchkine and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Pina Bausch, are women.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>With Pina Bausch, every scene has a bundle of meanings that
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>complement and contradict each other. Nothing is narrow or
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>unequivocally definable; even apparently obvious meanings
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>are suffused by a lot of minor doubts. When I try to pin her
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>down to interpretations, she says, &quot;I don’t know exactly.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>That is true and not true. Of course she knows; only she does
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>not know exactly. &quot;Can one know exactly?” she asks.

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>body. Jan Minarek sits behind a music stand and nervously

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>loneliness and desire, referring to each other in such a con
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>cealed way that their common point is sometimes hard to
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>find. Pina doesn’t want a continuous storyline; that is too
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>smooth for her. She seeks a logic coming from intuition in
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>stead of intellect. That explains the many repetitions and the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>penetrating detail, to which much of the audience is unrecep
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>The improvisational material adds up to a catalog of gestures
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and behaviors according to the themes of the piece, such as
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>’tenderness.&quot; &quot;Tenderness toward oneself” is the title of an
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>exercise in which the dancers fondle their own bodies to fulfill
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>their emotional needs. They caress their faces and arms; play
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>with their hair; touch their breasts, their bellies; tickle their
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>knees and feet. When everyone practices these gestures on
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>themselves, the effect is harmonious and relaxed; when cou
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ples try it on each other, a struggle develops—affection be
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>comes a burden.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>This leads to an exercise in which all the women subject a
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>man, and all the men a woman, to the gestures of tenderness.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>The small, playful gestures of the women have an unpleasant,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>pushy effect (&quot;It’s like ants on an apple,” Pina comments), but
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the men’s gestures appear to be really brutal, aggressive and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>possessive (the infamous slap on the ass). They command the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>woman, encircle her, lift her up, lay her down. Meryl bears it
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>like a doll, her face expressionless. It is one of the strongest
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>scenes in the play—a ceremony of submission, a desecration
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>of the dead.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>From Collecting the Material to Performance
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Pina has a pile of paper scraps with all the exercises written

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to themes or movements, music or dancers. This game of soli
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>taire never ends, and sometimes we come up with a meaning
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ful frame. The individual sequences change with the context
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in which they are placed. Jo-Ann’s &quot;Ow Aria” (&quot;ow&quot; in all
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pitches and moods) turns from funny to sad when it follows a
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tired waltz.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>When I suggest solutions to this theater puzzle, I do so ac
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>cording to traditional patterns of action. I try to show a cou
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ple in its different stages or a character in its development.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Pina finds this boring (&quot;Now the whole secret&apos;s out&quot;). She
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wants a total impression, from which the audience can choose
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the events it wishes to follow. Therefore she doubles scenes,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>complicates their structure by intermixing them. Many scenes
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>run parallel, commenting on and overlapping each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Sometimes ten different actions occur at once; then again
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>everything is concentrated on one single event.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It is a form of theater that is too demanding for most of the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>spectators (and critics); they cannot handle the offer to as
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>semble the piece themselves. It is a theater without instruc
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tions for use, without an ostensible structure and interpreta
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>tion—a subjective reality that can be encountered only sub
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>jectively. A similar thing happens in Robert Wilson’s pieces,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>but with a decisive difference which perhaps derives from the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>difference between men’s and women&apos;s art. Wilson&apos;s point of
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>departure is abstract: a mathematical, precisely calculated
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>pattern that is repeated and varied many times. Pina Bausch,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>however, starts with the personal, making her private sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>rhythm and association the coordinator of the piece.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The more the play develops a shape, the more it changes.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Scenes that appeared harmless in rehearsal take on an unex
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>pected aggressiveness through the order in which they are
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>rearranged. It has become a malevolent piece, even if there is
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>much to laugh at. &quot;Maybe the saddest thing about it is that it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>so cheerful,&quot; Pina says. The empty space has something op
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pressive about it—an elegant prison in which people are at
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>their own mercy and very small. The women wear evening
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>dresses in gaudy colors, changing them often; the men are in
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dark suits and use lots of hair oil. The elegant style only seems
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>to underscore the wretchedness of the tricks everyone plays
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>on everyone else. &quot;l am standing on top of the piano and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>threaten to fall off,” says Vivienne Newport in one scene.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>But before I do, I scream very loudly so no one will miss it.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>There is still no title. We search the rehearsal protocols and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>songbooks, make a long list of words and quotes that suit the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>piece. Finally Pina comes up with a title she had proposed in
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the beginning: Kontakthof (contact zone). Some like it, others
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>—mostly men—don’t. Kontakthof—this terrible word refers
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>not only to brothels; prisons and juvenile institutions have
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>their Kontakthof too. We test people, ask strangers and friends
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>what they associate with the word. A lot of men emphasize
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>that nothing occurs to them at all. That confirms it: a title that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>causes so much suppression must be good.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>I cannot summarize the work of the Wuppertaler Tanztheater
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>from the four weeks I spent with them. Too much defies
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>description, especially if the work is extremely subjective as
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Pina Bausch’s is. There are also the many long nights, the lack
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>of sleep, too many cigarettes — an entire rhythm of life dictat
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>ed by the work and reflecting back on it. This cannot be con
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>veyed except in terms of voyeuristic theater gossip.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>The End
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Anecdotes have something unserious about them, but I want
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to relate one nevertheless. When I ask Pina what kind of thea
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>ter she likes, she tells me a story. Two people are speaking
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>about Robert Wilson’s Einstein on the Beach. Says one: “The
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>part I liked best was when the white horse slowly crossed the

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>the first: “But l saw it quite clearly.” Pina Bausch: “Theater

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Call together a large group of women, anywhere from 20
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to 400. The women can be any age, any class, any height and

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>peoples your own community. This ratio should hold true for

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Select at least three of these women to play the non

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>administrators. For realism’s sake, the performance site should
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>be at least 50 miles from the nearest city and not on a public
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>transportation line. This may make travel to and from the per

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>but when the whole system holds it up,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>it’s even harder. So we organized. There
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were about eight of us, from the ages of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>nine to 13, and we called ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>&quot;The Little Eagles.&quot; We organized reci
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tals and we did dances from each one
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of our tribes. The families started to get
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>involved: they brought out their old
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>outfits; mothers started to do bead
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>work. It was really a big thing. We were
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>really involved in our whole culture.

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>dances; we couldn’t just show them.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>We started to stage them and rework
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>them, and added lights, and we began

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>gles&quot; anymore, so we called ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>&quot;Thunderbirds. It’s the 20th year—the

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>do a little bit more; I wanted to do
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>other things. I met a woman who want-

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;That’s a nice young girl! Now you stop that,&quot; the waitress
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>is hissing, trying to preserve decorum. Charlie’s is empty ex

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>&quot;Does he love you?
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;Who?

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>&quot;Yeah, he does. He worries about me a lot. But I guess

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>weeks
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>&quot;It’s not really in my head anymore— it’s bad to have stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>like that floating around in you head afterwards; that&apos;s what
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>can mess you up. It can make you afraid, of life. .. and l could
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>have a lot to be afraid of if I took the time to check it out, you
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>know?” Donna is giggling. I didn’t know anyone else in town,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>except my boyfriend—no other chicks—so I hung out one
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>night with this stripper who lives in Oakland. Can you im

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>if you don’t drive it’s a long way. So this girl—she’s older than
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>me—we go over to her place with a bunch of people to listen
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to records. Really...it was dull, just smokin&apos; weed, no one
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>talkin&apos; about anything interesting at all. So, then this chick
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>goes into the bathroom and she’s gone a long time. Gosh,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>thought she was sick or something. I got worried about her.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Do you know what she was doing? Shooting up! Wow. So by
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>then, I thought I really should go. I told my boyfriend l’d be

			<pb n='35'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>home by eleven, but it was way past that. The buses weren&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>running. So I left this girl’s apartment and walked a couple of
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>blocks to the freeway and put out my thumb.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>exhale, sinking in the booth.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;Yep, that’s right. So along comes this car with these two
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>black guys— they looked nice, real well-dressed and all. They
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>asked if I wanted a lift and I did, so l got in. It was about three
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in the morning, and I figured my boyfriend was frantic by
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>then. I really was asking for it. And I didn’t want to offend
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>them by refusing them; l’m not prejudiced. I thought they
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>were being kind, and they said they were going to San Fran
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cisco
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&quot;Well, they turned off before we got to the bridge. And
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>then it started. They grabbed me and made me lie down on
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the floor of the car so I couldn’t see where they were taking
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>me. l’m sure it was somewhere in Oakland—they didn’t drive
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>&quot;They took me into this duplex-style house. I think they
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>were pimps. Their girlfriends were there, too, right in the liv
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ing room, when they brought me in. That&apos;s the one thing
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>can’t understand— why those women could be there the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>time and not do anything to help me. Not a thing. I think they
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>were getting their kicks from it because I was white. &apos;Now
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>you’re really going to get it—white bitch&apos;—saying things like
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>that all the time.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Donna’s red stage lipstick looks black in the dim yellow
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>light of Charlie’s. She is looking at the wall beyond me as she
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>talks.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>&quot;They had junk there, and they made me shoot it up! They
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>held me and forced the fucking needle into my arm! That was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>terrible—that, and those women. I was afraid they hooked me
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>by doing that, but. .. later, the policeman told me I wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>have to worry about that—unless I liked the stuff. They shot
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>me up until I couldn’t see straight and then they pulled me
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>into the bedroom and raped me. It went on all night. I tried to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>get up in the middle of the night to get away but an arm
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>would come up in the dark and grab me by the hair and hit
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>me. ’You fuckin’ bitch—if you do that again l’II kill I was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>scared but l kept as calm as l could; I wanted to get out alive.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>&quot;But I don’t think they wanted a murder on their hands
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>’cause the next day, real early, we went through the car rou
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tine again and they dropped me where they had picked me
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>up. I flagged down a police car. The police drove me around
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and we tried to locate the place. But it was in one óf those
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>streets where the houses all look alike...
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The cops really were very nice about it. And my boyfriend
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>thought I was dead or something. The police were already
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>looking for me, actually—’cause he already called them when
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Iwas three hours late. He must’ve called them the same time
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>those guys picked me up. And the police were very polite,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>especially this one officer who had to ask me for my panties
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to keep as evidence. I said, ’Gosh, theyre awfully dirty,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>shouldn’t I wash them out for you?&quot; ’Oh, no, M’am&apos;—he was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>blushing—’oh, no, M’am, the whole story is right here. Hee
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>hee&apos;—l guess they took those things to a laboratory, some

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Donna’s smile breaks, it’s the drunk again. She screams at

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The waitress comes out of the kitchen; furious, &quot;Finish

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Donna is fidgeting with a spoon, tapping at it with her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>long red nails. She’s plainly tired and there’s one more show

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>When you grow up in a small town, you learn one thing very
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>early. You learn that you must decide to stay there, or to leave.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Staying is not so hard. If you are a girl, you get C’s in school,
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>you get pregnant by the least detestable of your boyfriends
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>You marry, you buy a house. If you need extra money, you
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>run the cash register at the local supermarket or you work as a

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>But getting out takes some planning.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Now as far as I could figure, there were four ways to get out
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and stay out of a small southern town: (1) committing a crime
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>(2) joining the army, (3) becoming an entertainer, or (4) get
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ting a scholarship to an out-of-state college

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>put my picture on the front page of the town newspaper. My
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>mother would be mortified; my relatives scandalized; the
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>whole town would be talking. In a sense, l’d never get out
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Now, 1 really loved uniforms. I wanted to be a Girl Scout and
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>get to go to Cirl Scout camp, but an integrated troop was nos
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>possible at that time and there was not enough money for ar
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>all-Black troop. But I still loved uniforms. My feelings were
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>modified, however, when my younger sister came home cry
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ing one day from second grade. There had been a memorial
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>service for one of her classmates&apos; fathers. He had been blown
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to smithereens in Vietnam. I knew then that joining the army,

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Icouldn’t sing. I could barely dance. People groaned at my

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Well, the importance of getting in was obvious to me a long
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>time ago. I was called &quot;brain” and &quot;egghead,” too. I went
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>through fifth and sixth grades in the advanced classes. But
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>wasn’t happy. Joanne Mignona was happy, because she was
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>curvy and cool, but I was just. ..weird. Weird and left out.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Somehow, I had equated happiness with popularity, so my
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>intelligence began to mean less to me. In seventh grade I still

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>when things started to change.

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>stopped making me feel good. I felt like an alien, gangly with
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>glasses and zero sex-appeal. Who needed it? I sure didn’t.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>So the next day when Mr. Duncan yelled at Joan Cecora in
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>class and told her to stop bothering me, I said I had been talk

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>Mr. Duncan said, “Well, uh, then, could you both come out
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>side with me?” I felt a surge of excitement! I was being repri
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>manded by a teacher for the first time, and I felt great. Scary,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>like I was floating away, but I wasn’t alone. I was with Joan
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>Cecora.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>That night in detention I was the only girl with fifteen six-foot
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>tall boys wearing black leather and smacking gum. (Years later

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>So, in eighth grade I got my first B. By ninth grade I had got
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>ten two C+’s. I had completely lost my photographic memo

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>trauma. But I felt so much better! I had contact lenses, sol
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>felt pretty; I was popular; I was an average student. I was real
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>neat. I was in.

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>back at the long line of Victorian mansions, those that hadn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>been washed away by Hurricane Camille. And my friend
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>turned to me and said, &quot;A hundred years ago we would have

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>now. But sometimes I feel a certain I wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>want to have anything thrust upon me, but it’s hard to choose
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>something you don’t have to.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>When I was a little girl, there were always babies around—
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was the eldest of nine children—so there was often a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>crying and noise and confusion. But there would be the quiet,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>serene times, too. Mama used to let us feed the babies. You&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>take the latest baby, go into her bedroom, sit in the rocker,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and give it the bottle. You&apos;d be holding the baby, and you&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>just sit there, looking at each other, for the longest time.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Sometimes the baby would stop sucking in the intensity of
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>looking at you, and those bright, intelligent eyes would gaze
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>at you as though they were really seeing something, as though
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>they were recognizing you, and you&apos;d feel—not like you were
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the mother, holding your child, but as though you were hold
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ing yourself.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>have never felt so close to anyone since. I have never had
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>anyone else trust me so much.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Then there were those times when you&apos;d get an earache in the
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>middle of the night and you&apos;d have to go wake up Mama.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>You’d go quietly into the bedroom to her side of the bed, and
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>no matter how much your ear hurt, there would be this awe
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>some silent moment when you&apos;d just stand and look at her,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>wondering how lightly you’d have to touch her cheek before
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>she’d wake up. Sometimes she&apos;d sense your presence, and
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>reach for you before you&apos;d touched her.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>My world requires that I be alert to possible violence. Asser

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>At the end of the summer, a friend returned from Turkey and

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N006'/>tional, and sexual struggles of a woman whose unconvention
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>al lifestyle resulted in some of the most original fiction of this
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>century. The theme centers on the inability to face one’s own
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N009'/>identity for fear of failure and rejection. The dichotomy that
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N010'/>existed in Jane Bowles’ world was so strong that she could not
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N011'/>choose her path. Though her writing was exceptional, the
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N012'/>creative act was so painful for her that, had it not been for the
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N013'/>tremendous pressure from the outside world, she might have
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N014'/>stopped writing altogether.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N015'/>Conceptually I wanted to present the idea of Jane Bowles
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>life and express the feelings of her inner struggle. I wanted to

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N033'/>company of other people. I call people, I visit people, I make

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N012'/>director. 1 like being hidden, and I tend
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N013'/>to use other people to mask my powers,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N014'/>so that ! don’t think a lot of people per

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N016'/>and it was the same when the group was

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N022'/>on a day-to-day basis. I like the larger
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N023'/>issues, and I like to deal with big plans
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N024'/>and then watch them implemented and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N025'/>then direct them. So this structure of

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N027'/>and also gives people within the or

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N054'/>a place now—we’ve had a history, and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N055'/>a stable organization with pieces that
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N056'/>stand the test of time. But if funding

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>What we found was there were about 50

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that nobody would think about asking.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Its not true. Because if you look at our

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>It took me a while to figure that one

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>questioned if there was something

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>struggle for me—trying to figure out
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>what world am I in. I think that if I were

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>I am a writer. I had played the conventional role of an

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the role of writer. To her credit she turned out a script in four
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>days. However, it was an ordeal for me to read through it. My
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>character, Jenny, the &quot;quiet one” had minimal lines. When
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she did speak it was to tell fortunes from the wrinkles of a

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>less available—is that in the ’60s it was

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was easy to find a part-time job, and it

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>...was it easier to find space then, or
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>was it more difficult?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Simone: Well, I think we were more
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>satisfied with less. ...So we were happy
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to find a cooperative space such as the

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to do our work in that situation; so, in a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sense, l’d say yes, it didn’t seem dif

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the Gramercy Arts Theater offered us
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>space, that was free; Woodstock, there

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>hall audiences in major museums. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>came back to this country and did—in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a loft on Canal Street—a series of very
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>interesting performances with a Fluxus
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>group. ...So it moved from a very high
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>culture context, where this thing be
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gan, into a situation of Canal Street,

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>we did whatever we wanted for seven,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>eight, ten, twelve people. Then Yoko
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>had a series— it moved a little bit to her
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>loft— but it still had a very underground,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>noneconomic base.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Michael: But you are comparing spaces
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in Europe with spaces in New York...
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Is there a difference?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Alison: Oh, I think that Europe has a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>cultural base to consider new move
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ments, new ideas, because it&apos;s an older
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>culture. They simply take the shock
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>better; they want it more, they can use
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>it more. We accept it; we don’t seem to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>have a fundament for it to sit on. For a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>newer country we don’t shock as much
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>we take it as we take a new anything,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>because we are used to exploring new

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>We take art with a little less history than
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the rest of Europe. Europe has all this
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>backup for anything that happens. We

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>things that happens. And when it hap

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>was just extremely different from when

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Carolee: l’d like to think about my first
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>space, because art seemed to be some
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>form of economic excrescence. It was
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>expendable, and the space I found was
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>an excrescence and was also expend
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>able. And that gave me a sense of pro

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I transgressing everything I should do,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>could use this open potential right in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the middle of New York City I could
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>even see the Empire State Building out
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of my window). It was 568 a month,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>which I had a hard time getting togeth
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I was a dog dryer; I ’did porno
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>films; I taught Sunday schôol. And
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>could also plead with the landlord, you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>know, when I couldn’t get 568 together.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>could go there in tears. And he had no
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>idea of what I was doing up there.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It had DC current; when you walked
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sparks came out. There was.a tub and a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sink in the hall that I shared with a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>derelict; he had been there before me,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>so I did not think it was my place to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>completely,kick him out. We had a sort
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of tacit arrangement where he would
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>usually disappear early in the morning.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Only my lovers had to adjust to him as
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>well; that was all right. But the thing
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>about the space was that it was left with
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>debris—fur debris — it was a very haunt
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ed space. Someone had been chopping
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>up fur collars for 40 years there, and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>when you walked the walls went [ges-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ture of walls caving in)—vibrating with
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fur dust. So I immediately began to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>work with all this fur debris; and I still
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>use the cutting boards for my construc
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>tions, but with that sense then of a to

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>somehow to the unconscious mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Michael: Comparing that to the present
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>day: you’re no longer transgressing, is
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that right?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Carolee: Yes, l am, because the co-op is
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>trying to get me out. l’m still there.

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>as it was in 1963.... Always crisis, al
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ways difficult. For the festival that I do,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>always want a place that is very tough
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to get. Anybody would have trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>getting it, so l know ahead of time that
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>it’s going to be trouble..
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>wanted public spaces, and l asked
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>for Central Park in 1966, and the man in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>charge of the city then was Mayor Wag
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ner. He wrote me back that my work
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wasn’t art; and so I was offended by
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that. So I wasn’t particularly thrilled
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>about him as a mayor either. I didn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>really consider him a good politician.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>But, in any case, that wasn’t the issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>wanted Central Park. Well, then Hoving
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>took over as the commissioner and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Lindsay came in, and he gave me Cen
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tral Park. Then I wasn’t content with
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>that; I wanted the Staten Island Ferry.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Now, to rent the Staten Island Ferry is
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>like 40, 50, 60 thousand dollars for 24
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>hours. And it didn’t have the proper
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>electricity; I had to have Con Ed come
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and rewire it. ...And here are all these
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>artists donating their artwork and the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>printer donating the poster, and the city
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wanted 40, 50, 60 thousand dollars for
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>their ferry boat—which was absurd. So
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>we ended up getting it for free. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>my problem. There’s so many artists;
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and if we’re not getting money, then
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>how on earth can any building get
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>money or any landlord get money? So,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>since l’ve chosen to do it this way, since
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>you can’t pay 600 people, it would take
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>an incredible budget...the thing is,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>every year, it’s a big crisis.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Then, as far as my performance
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>spaces, just on my own playing cello or
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>TV cello or any of those pieces, people
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>have heard about some of the pieces
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>l’ve done. And that scares them; they
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>mix them all up: they say I was nude
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>going in an oil drum playing the TV
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>cello. They mix everything all up, and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>then when I go to ask someone for the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>performance space, theyre terrified;
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>theyre afraid l’m going to burn their
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>house down or something. If they knew
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the pieces, they wouldn’t be afraid.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>They might not like them, but at least
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>theyd feel safe. So, either way, wheth-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>er it’s for me or whether it&apos;s for the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>festival, always difficult.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Michael: You seem more or less to be
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>speaking for everyone in saying that
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>things have changed, but they are still
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>the same. And that there were difficul
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ties in the old days and there are diffi
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>culties today. l’m going to skip to the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>fifth question.. Iwhich) says: &quot;With
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>the current recession, arts funding has
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>been steadily on the decrease. What are
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>the prospects in terms of funding for
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>noncommercial performance?... What
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>do you think will happen to the arts
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>with the current recession?
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>Simone: Well, I think it is good to have
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>fat times and lean times. And I think
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that as funding gets harder people will
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>think their lives over in a different way.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>I think that certain individual peo
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ple work much better when they have a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>lot of support and other individual peo
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ple work much better when theyre real
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ly up against the wall. I think that when
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>things get hard, it’s really time to look
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>into oneself. And so in terms of having
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a real spiritual backbone, maybe hard
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>times bring a backbone into the con
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ceptual part of the art....
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Michael: Have you benefited from
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>grants personally?
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Simone: Yes, well...the last five years
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>did a series of large pieces. The first one
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>did because I was applying for a grant,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and I felt, well, if they think l’m going
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to pay a lot of people, they’Il probably
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>give me the money. And I got the mon
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ey and I paid a lot of people. And then
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the next year, I really had launched it
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and I needed to do another big piece,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and I didn’t have a grant. So I hustled
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>up the money. So then I went ahead
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and I did four big pieces in a period of
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>five years, and I hustled it up one way
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>or the other. The only grant I got was
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that first year.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Michael: Elaine, what about the Inter
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>media Foundation and grants?
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Elaine: Well, the Intermedia Founda
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tion came about when...l had finan
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>cially stumbled into a job where they
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>paid me a lot of money to do a Bell Tel
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ephone Hour with Donald O’Connor
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and 20 dancers. I had just borrowed a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lot of money to do Fantastic Cardens,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and somebody met me on the street
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>afterwards, and they said, &quot;Oh, you’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>done this wonderful work; when are
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>you going to do your next piece?” And
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>said, &quot;When I pay back the 53,000 I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>owe for doing this one, which had tak
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>en three years to do. So, here was this
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>job, 5500 a week; so I fancied that I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>would go into commercial work and I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>would work six months and I would be
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>able to afford my dance company.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>could pay them salaries and everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>But then that wasn’t the way it is, I dis
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>covered. And so then, I was talking to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>this lawyer who was representing me,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and he said, &quot;Well, you know, you
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>should do what you want to do and you
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>should have a foundation. And then
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>he explained to me that a foundation is
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a tool for artists so that people can give
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>them money. And then theyIl get it off
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>their taxes. And I thought that sounded
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wonderful.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>You know, I had had so much help
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>financially in the ’60s from friends who
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>lent me their equipment and were my
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>gurus, that l&apos;m very into trading. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>had a friend who taught me how to use
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>a 1ómm camera and how to edit 16mm
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>movies so l didn’t have to go to school
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to learn. So whenever I did something
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bad with my filmmaking, I could always
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>cross it off as—well, I didn’t go to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>school, see, sol lost that $100 or S10 or
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>whatever it was, and that&apos;s part of my
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>schooling. There was always a sharing
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>kind of thing going on, and I think that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>still going on. And I think that what
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>happened is that the foundation thing
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>became a way of formalizing that, of
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>making it work within this new system
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that they were setting up. But the prob
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>lem that happened with it is that—
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>think that the (New York Statel Council
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and people who do business looked at
			</p>
			<pb n='63'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>us as possibly—well, they used to say
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it—they were going to give us seed
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>money to start a business. And then,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>after they had given us a grant for two
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>or three years, then Simone would go
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>out and be a successful choreographer
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>businesswoman. They just couldn’t see
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that there is no such thing as money for
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>dancing or choreographing or what
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ever; there just isn’t any. Nothing that
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>you can do, no amount of money that
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>you beg or plead from Citibank or cor
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>porations that will give you anything
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>(which mostly they won’t) is going to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>get you money. And it you’re a chore
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ographer, you have to pay. Like every
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>$100 your dancers make is 5800 (be
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cause you have eight dancers) that you
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>have to raise.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>So, on the one hand, l’m very in
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>conflict. I like to see dancers paid;
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>don’t like lean times ever. And I guess
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>that comes from always working and,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>you know, having very lean times. So
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>don’t like them. I want money to do my
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>work, I want to pay my dancers, I want
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to buy City Center, I want full-page ads
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in The New York Times....(But) what
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the New York State Council wants to see
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>is that I can raise money. That’s what
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>you’re really being trained to do, is raise
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>money...
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>guess what l’m saying is that I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that we need grants. I hear people com
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ing from Holland who do get paid mon
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ey to be artists. It sounds great to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>And I don’t know anybody more practi-
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>cal than artists about money. I really
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>don’t. I think we’re much more practi
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cal than businessmen, because we real
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ly have to watch it very, very carefully,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and we have to earn the money usually,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>or most of it, that we spend on our art.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Alison: Well, l’II just pick up right there
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>about Holland. I went from Cal Arts
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>back to New York City via Vermont with
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>two students leaving for Holland. One
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of them was Barbara Bloom, who since
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>made an excellent film career. And the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>second year that she was there scored a
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>wonderful grant for something like
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>523,000 I don’t know how much). They
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>regularly pay their artists—once you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>established as an artist and have done
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>your work, sort of the way a shoemaker
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>turns out. There’s this quality in Europe
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of simply doing your work; if you keep
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>at it, you’Il finally be paid, and it will
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>scale up. We don’t quite have that sense
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in this country. It’s all right; we have
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>other things...
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>I think that a country that, per se,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>funds artists is a good thing, but it does
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>not necessarily mean there’ll be better
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>art. But it&apos;s a good thing for that indi
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>vidual artist, because, to talk to Si
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>mone’s point, we’re all very different
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>kinds of artists—some that suffer best
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and have lean times and do wonderful
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>work behind the struggle. Some really
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>have to have a certain level of support;
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>they want five or six people in their en
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>vironment or in their performance
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>piece. They have to have that. They
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>should have the funding to be able to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>get it, and if they don’t and they have a
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>lean, hard time, they simply don’t get
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>their work done....
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>think we don’t any of us really
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>want hard times, but when they come,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>because of the people that we are or the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>times that we are in, there are ways to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>deal with them which can be absolutely
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>remarkable. I was in Warsaw, I was in
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Poland, and I did a show there, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>walked on the main street and saw
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>some galleries dealing with things like
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Picasso and Miro. I wondered what
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>they were doing dealing with Picasso
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and Miro. I went into the Picasso gal
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>lery because I had been given a card
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that said, &quot;Go to the second floor, go to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the third level down—find your way
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>into that space, and you’ll be amazed at
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>what you find.&quot; Someone showed up at
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the door and escorted me through the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Picasso to the second floor, where there
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was a women’s and children’s blouse
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>exhibition, which was facing onto some
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>children’s drawings, which began a sort
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of circular labyrinth which you walked
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>through, looking at little tee shirts and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>printed shirts and children’s drawings.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Finally, you came into something the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>size of two phone booths, which was a
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>very fine conceptual artist’s exhibition
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>involving a chair, a couple of apples,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and a little radio, which had been put
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>up behind three subterfuges. And it was
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>their third show and was beautiful.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Michael: I hope you burned the card.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Carolee, do you have any anecdotes for
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>us about grants?
			</p>
			<pb n='64'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Carolee: l’m concerned, l’m confused,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>think, about the institutionalization of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>funding and the fact that the alternative
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>spaces of the ’70s had a tremendous
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>amount of vitality. And the early grant
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing seemed to help people who were
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>just at the point where it made an ap
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>preciable difference in what they were
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>able to accomplish. Right now it looks
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>like a morass out there to me. Younger
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>artists, who are struggling to find space
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and funding, are also all into marketing
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>strategies. Or many of them are. They
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>talk to me about being too sloppy and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>idealistic and having leftover attitudes
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>from the ’60s, because I haven’t gotten
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>together my networking. It&apos;s a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cruddy, more more money terms;
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and they come to discuss it with me.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>And theyre bitterly, bitterly disillu
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sioned by the credulity and the same
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ness of my situation, which is pretty
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>much the same for me now as it&apos;s al
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ways been.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>put it together piecemeal, a little
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>bit of teaching here. The grants have
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>been enormously helpful and made
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>work possible. I was slow to realize that
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>they meant what they said, coming out
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of all that independence of the ’60s.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>When I heard that there were grants
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>being given, I didn’t believe it for a long
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>time. Then I started to apply, and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>never got them. And it seemed that the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>work was too complicated. And one
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>year I was just so enraged, I wrote to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>one of the funding sources and de
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>scribed an all-white piece in which the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>film would be white, the installation
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>would be different white materials, the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>performers would be all drenched in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>whiteness, and I needed as much mon
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ey as they could give me. They liked
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>that one; that was the one grant I did
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>get. It was called Blizzard.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Charlotte: Well, when I started out all
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>these things that l’m involved in, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>so thrilled when I heard about the Na
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>tional Endowment, that they were go-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ing to give money to artists and organi
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>zations. So I wrote them that I wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>money to do the festival in Central
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Park, and they wrote me back that there
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>was no such category as art in public
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>spaces.&quot; Then I wanted an individual
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>grant to do cello and performance
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>pieces. And they wrote me back—this
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>was in 1966—they wrote me back that
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>they didn’t have a category of perfor
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>mance art. Then I thought, well, okay,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>l’II do video, because (Nam Junel Paik
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>had made me the TV bra in ’69. So,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>thought, this is great; now l’II write
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>them and ask them for a grant to do
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>video art. And they wrote me back that
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>they had no category for video artists
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>This was all before; now they have
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>these categories. So I really didn’t fit
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>into anything, and I was getting an

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>or place for it or something? Anyway,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>did succeed in getting some small grants
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>for the festival...
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Then I tried to get, I wanted a Gug

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>thing together. And it was just such a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>handsome package—color photos
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mean, I would have hired me if....
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mean, seriously. Yeah, l’ve been on a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>panel; I was on the CAPS panel; that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>what gave me cancer is trying to give

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cry and cry; and then l’d see these in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>credible artists and l&apos;d just—oh my
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>God, we didn’t give them a CAPS grant.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>And I couldn’t stand it...
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Oh, so, the Guggenheim. I was so
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>impressed with the package I sent
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>them, and then I found the one thing
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>we all dream of, that I had a friend or
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the selecting panel. And l have a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>enemies, as you probably know. But
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>have a lot of friends too, and it bal
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ances itself off. And my friends have
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>such love and give me such support and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>such love in every way that it’s okay,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the enemies just don’t stand a chance
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>But the thing is, just to have one of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>those friends on the panel giving away
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>all that money—oh my, I just knew
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>had it. And they wrote me back; I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>fit into any of their categories. l’m not a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>painter, l’m not a sculptor; I wasn’t any
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>of those things, and that was in 1979.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>And l’m really annoyed, you know, that
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>don’t seem to belong.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>But anyway, we have gotten some
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>grants and one very important thing
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>that the grants have helped to do: when
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>you go to the New York Telephone
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Company... well, when you go to them
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>and they see on your poster that the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>National Endowment funded you, the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>New York State Council on the Arts
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>funded you. .. it gives you prestige and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>it makes other people willing to give you
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>a small grant. So I think it’s very, very
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>important for that reason, no matter
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>what the National Endowment gives
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>you or the New York State Council, just
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>to be able to use their name is helpful
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>with a lot of business people.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>And there’s one last point: I think
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>we’re the greatest, what Elaine says, the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>greatest business people in the world

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>kinds of things accomplished. I think

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>money, and no businessmen in their

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with something they didn’t have a little

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Elaine: That’s funny because there has
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>never been a moment in my life when!
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>haven’t taken most of the money
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>earned teaching and put it towards my
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>choreography. I have never had a time
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>when anything that I did was paid for
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>by grants. I think, in relation to the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>business thing, that it is important for
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>artists to realize something. It always
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>has a circular effect.. you get some
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>thing going that pays for something,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>then it seems as if something is more
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>expensive all the time. And artists are
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>always working from never being paid
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>for what they do. So you always have to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>have at least two jobs, full-time jobs:
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the job you work at for love and the job
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>you work at to get paid for. Whereas
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>businessmen, they have—the rent is
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>paid where they work, their telephone
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>is paid, their paper is paid, their sta
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>tionery is paid, they often have some
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>body to do secretarial work.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>And I loved what Carolee was saying
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>about networking and all those things,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and I feel like it is just such an enor
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>mous, overwhelming thing, all of this.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>You’ve got to let everybody know what
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>you are doing. Spiritually I think it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>fine; it&apos;s just communication. That&apos;s all
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>it is, and we can call it dirty words like
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>advertising and PR, but it&apos;s just letting
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>people know what you’re doing. But we
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>don’t have the resources; we have to do
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>it ourselves or not do it at all. And if
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>you don’t do it at all, then it doesn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>count. So it becomes huge; I feel like
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>l’m under this enormous barrage of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>obligations that I have to meet, you
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>know—and it’s huge. And, in a way, it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>huger, because in the ’60s, it&apos;s true
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>[BELLJ, it was easier to get a part-time

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>There is a point where the making of art

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the work. Do you see this as a problem?
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Artists have really not grappled with
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>this sufficiently. There are no agents for
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>artists. There are agents for every other
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>group. For artists there are dealers, but
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dealers are not agents; you go to the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>dealer to try and sell your work and that
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>is not the same thing. In the art world,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>we have this weird system going on
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>where you do everything—it’s a cottage

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>go sell it, and then you package it, and
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>then you invoice it, and the check
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>bounces, and then you go to the bank
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and you write back. The whole thing is

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>By 1982 the questions changed. There were far larger issues:
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N031'/>How can I fight the despair and hopelessness—my own and
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>the pain in the world? At this point Narratives: a dramatic
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>event made a special kind of common sense. Cheryl Clarke
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>was the first poet whose voice I could recognize in some vis
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>ceral way; her words made me feel hopeful
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N036'/>Narratives has been a rare, sustained effort. We have devel

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N038'/>June 1982. It’s important for me to keep perspective on what a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>gift Narratives is. How many black women in theater today
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>work regularly, for pay, with other black women who stimu-

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N042'/>The essence of Clarke’s feminist vision is that she creates
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N043'/>women we are forced to respect. We may not agree with their

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N015'/>honor English drama class; the other, the militant Black
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N016'/>spokesperson for the Black students. I was the only student in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N017'/>the United Federation of Teachers contingent sent to walk in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N018'/>the King Memorial March in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1968.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N019'/>In college during the late ’60s and early ’70s, I was chosen
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N020'/>one of four leaders of the campus Black student organization
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N021'/>(Black Unity) and editor of its newspaper, and I taught drama
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N022'/>for the college’s summer activities program. When Black Unity
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N023'/>aligned itself with the New York chapter of the Black Panther
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N024'/>Party, I presented a proposal for the formation of the Black
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N025'/>Panther Party Revolutionary Peoples Theatre. But the faction
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N026'/>al split of the party soon aborted that idea.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N027'/>Three years later I joined the newly formed 127th Street
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N028'/>Repertory Ensemble for a weekly salary of $100. The company
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N029'/>finally fulfilled my need to merge political consciousness with
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N030'/>a viable theater involvement. It was not in the commercial
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N031'/>mainstream and its director was committed to depicting the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N032'/>life of the Black community. The company did not get re
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N033'/>funded and its pursestrings snapped. I landed on the unem
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N034'/>ployment line and half-heartedly went the traditional path to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N035'/>various auditions and cattle calls in search of acting jobs. The
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N036'/>parts for Black women were appalling. Almost always written
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N037'/>by men depicting women merely as ornaments, backdrops, or
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N038'/>objects of their frustration.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N039'/>From these pivotal events and experiences, I was to emerge
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N040'/>the artist-cultural worker—a vehicle through which African

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N044'/>and culture. I have no desire to prop up the lie that all things

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N046'/>and the other gender is &quot;sub&quot; or &quot;lesser.&quot; It is an insult to the

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Jane Chambers was a proponent of

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Clare: Jane once told me how she had
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>wanted to study playwrighting but at
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the time that was a career open only to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>men, so she studied acting.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Beth: That was at the Pasadena Play-
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>house in 1957 when she was 20 years
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>old. She wanted to go into the play-

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ing: No, not allowed. Playwrights and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>directors were male. Actors and design
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ers were female. So she studied acting
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>there, and later in New York with Pisca
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tor. In the early ’60s she went to Maine
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>where she became a staff writer with
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>WMTW-TV in Poland Spring.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>also had her own talk show. In 1967 she
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>left Maine for New York and really set

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>writing.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Clare: When did Jane start writing
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>plays?
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Beth: She was an only child and would
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>create imaginary friends to entertain
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>herself. She would make cutouts of dif

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>various chairs in her house and have
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dialogues. She began writing down
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>these scenes and shaping them into lit
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tle plays.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>productions. She said she was so happy
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>she had lived to see that kind of turn
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>about where she could actually be in

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Jere: She had a large part in making

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>world. When I first met her she was
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>working for the Job Corps and was very
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>involved in the civil rights movement.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>performs what seem to be acts of ran

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Playwrights Horizons)?
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Beth: A Late Snow was the first main
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>stream play with positive images of les
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>bian characters. Reviews were good
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and the excitement about it in the gay
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>community was tremendous. Jane did
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>have some fear as to what the repercus

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Jere: She was frightened. She finished
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>revising A Late Snow right before it
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>went into production. By the time she
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>talked about her fears, she had already
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>made a decision. Jane did this quite
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>often. She made the decision and then
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>bounced off you the whole process that
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>had gotten her there, as confirmation

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>did it over and over again. A Late Snow

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>basements.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Clare: 1974, the year of A Late Snow,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was quite a time of triumph and strug

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>won her seat in the Massachusetts legis
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lature. It was also the year of the first

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Rights Bill.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Beth: In 1981 there was a radio talk
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>show on which Jane and David Rothen
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>berg of the Fortune Society were inter

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and listeners were just hysterical about
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the homosexual issue being discussed
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>on the radio. I think they expect it from
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>a man more than from a woman. Men
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>called in saying they wished she was
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>dead. How could a woman be talking
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>about &quot;that&quot;? One woman said that she
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>would kill her if she could get her hands
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>on her. Another woman started quoting
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>her interpretation of the Bible to Jane.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Jane, you know, was quite a Bible

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Beth: She corrected this woman&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>live together in the community. And
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>she saw that community in large terms,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>integrated black and white, gay and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>straight. She wanted to change our

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to appear in three of the other plays.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>There were at least two plays in which
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>no gay characters were planned. Who

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was trying to prove the point that lesbi
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ans are not an anomaly; lesbians are
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>not bizarre.

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>so touching. It was conducted by a

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and Beth, who recognized what Jane
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>had been doing in her work and had no

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of her congregation.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Beth: The north fork of Long Island has
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>been deeply touched by Jane. Everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in our immediate area—shop owners,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>friends, neighbors, straight people

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Jere: I think also the other dynamic that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>you both had going in that respect is
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that you did not close yourselves off

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>are very much involved in the com

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>much involved with all of them. That&apos;s,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>think, the really important thing that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>has happened, thanks to Jane.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Clare: Really what you are also saying is

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Beth: She always said she had to write

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>was &quot;first meetings&quot; and the play is an
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>extraordinary comedy. In Kudzu she

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Beth: Speaking of writing about people

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>were some people who tried to take her

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>which I am writing. I wouldn’t ask you
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to write about a situation outside of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>your experience. I write about what
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>know. That’s where it comes from.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Clare: How did she like performing in

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Beth: What a treat. What a treat. The

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>study had to go on for another woman
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>who was ill. Jane hadn’t performed in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>20 years. Larry [Lawrence Lane, co-pro
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ducer with John Glines) called her to do
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>it. She said, &quot;Well, I just don’t know,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Larry. He said, &quot;Just think of all the

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>back a third time. And they did.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Jere: Do you know, she went on in two
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>days.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Beth: Larry would run lines with her
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>until he would fall down. Then Nyla

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>would just keep going. Her first night
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>when she walked out on the stage—
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Jane always had hyperthyroid eyes—
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>thought they were going to pop right

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Beth: Jane took great pleasure from
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Blue Fish Cove’s success. Here she was
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>at 42 finally realizing some recognition.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Jane believed that doing things, being
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>involved, was terribly important for the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>psyche. Energy creates energy. Bore
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>dom creates boredom. She was a very
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>busy person. She liked working with
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>women. Whenever she could she saw to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>it that there were women in production
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>jobs and really made an effort to net
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>work herself in that way.

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Jere When we were going through her
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>papers last week, we came across a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>wonderful cartoon she had drawn of a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>woman at her office door gesturing to a

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>looked not unlike Jane and Beth.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Beth: 1had never lived with a writer
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>before. When we first started sharing
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>our lives 14 years ago, everytime the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>typewriter stopped I thought that meant
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>she wasn’t writing. And I would go in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and run by our dinner plans or discuss
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>everyday details that come up. It would
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>so enrage her, because even though she
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>wasn’t typing, she was deeply involved
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in her writing process. She said she was
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>going to put the typewriter on automa
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tic so l would stay out of the room.

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tradition of India. Kudiyattam—a theater production with
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>dialogue, monologue, mime, dance, music, singing, makeup,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and costume—is performed only in the state of Kerala. The
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>skills have been handed down for at least 1,000 years within
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the temple society. Traditionally performance was considered
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>a duty. It was an offering to the gods, one considered superior
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to the ordinary sacrificial offerings. The gods, it was said,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>enjoyed it more than anything else. Although land reforms,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>marital reforms, and a secular constitution have reduced the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>powerful position of the temple society, a few families still
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>perform Kudiyattam, continuing the tradition of rigorous
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>training and practice within their households and temple
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>compounds.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The plays today use the ancient Sanskrit scripts, but cer

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>allows for considerable extemporary performance. The stories
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>consist of mythology, social issues, ritual, and much romance.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The oldest performer at present is Mani Madgava Chakyar.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>He describes the plays as &quot;visual Yagas” (sacrificial ceremo
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>nies), for there are many links to the religious ceremony. The
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>fire for the lamp on the stage is brought from the shrine; the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wicks represent the god Agni. Once the Chakyar has put on
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the red band over his forehead, he assumes the status of a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Brahmin. With him, the performers become ritually separate
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>from the other devotees, in the audience, for the length of the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>performance.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Although the Chakyar has a central position in the Kudi
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>yattam plays, the performance cannot proceed without the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>presence of the seated Nangyar. She sings out the invocations
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>in the preliminary scenes, and it is her privilege to chant the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>final shlokas. A Nangyar who is skilled enough to sit on the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>cotton cloth has a complete knowledge of the repertoire. It is

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>The reason I started writing was out of a need—there was no
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>text written that really moved theater in a new direction. I felt
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>that the theater had one primary function, which was to de
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>velop a new text and language. The theater couldn’t compete
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>visually with the cinema, painting, or sculpture; nor could it
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>compete with movement because dance was exploring these
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>new territories; nor could it compete with music. The one
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>thing that was left, it seemed to me, for theater to do was to
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>deal with language.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>Every text I looked at or worked on always had drawbacks.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>Actually it was through Gertrude Stein that I started working
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>on language; she showed me the dictatorship and politics of
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>language. She showed me that a noun and a verb had roles
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>and that they played them out and words had histories, just
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>like people. She showed me, through The Making of Ameri
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>cans, that I could work without a character for the first time.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>Her language was so strong and so interesting that I liked lis
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>tening to the text. And I also have to throw in Roland Barthes,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>who—at the time I was thinking about this &quot;language” idea
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>wrote a great book called The Pleasure of the Text. And I cer

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>into something that I loved—words and language.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>It seemed clear that if anything extraordinary were to hap

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>In 1951 I moved into a loft that had been an extermination
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>factory. There was this great oven where they had exterminat
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>ed bugs from furniture. There I was in New York, in this exter
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>mination factory, painting visions of the western Pennsylvania
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>landscape on early American quilts—visions of a landscape
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>vanishing under strip mines, automobile junkyards, and sub
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>divisions. I was painting faded photographs from my memory
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>of farms I had seen in my childhood. As l began to juxtapose
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>these rural images over the quilts, the images became more
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>abstract. With the accumulation of multiple images, the col
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>lages became three-dimensional. Gradually I felt the need to
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>build architectural or environmental spaces for the assem
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>blages. Then these environments demanded characters to tell
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>their metaphoric stories. And suddenly in 1971 it just grew
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>into theater.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>The architectural spaces I created were metaphors for the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>action of the characters in my imagination and dreams—in
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>my dream theater. Space and architecture, having atmos
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>pheric involvement with form, light, and shadow, lent them
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>selves to narrative abstraction. I had always written journals,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>essays, short impressionist writings on the work of other ar
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>tists, and some criticism. So scripting for characters became
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>the natural way to include my writing. I am making perfor
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N025'/>mance constructions out of simultaneous and divergent as

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>away from.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>Istarted to think about objects and spaces—similar to what
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>Stein had done. And the first major piece I wrote was Room/
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>Raum. I just tried to think about the phenomenon of the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>space in a room. This thinking was directly related to my own
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>theater work. I spent hours in the theater space, a storefront
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>on 22nd Street. I was working in this room, this long, rectang
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>ular black box all the time. I was always in there thinking and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>making ideas. And what was this room? Could I understand it
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>but not abstract it? That’s a big struggle for me. The difference
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>between abstracting something and understanding it. I wasn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>abstracting a room because I didn’t have a room in mind
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>when I wrote about I wrote about the phenomenon of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>space. I tried to open up and think about it. It was like a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>meditative state in a way, of opening my mind up so that
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>could just think about Room and just think and think—and all
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>sorts of things started to happen. Strange things came out of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N025'/>my mind when I just focused on one place. And I came up
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>with a short text of about four pages that I was happy with.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>Itook out every connecting word I could find. All I had left
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>were objects, word objects. If I said “the room is sleeping,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N029'/>would erase &quot;the” and &quot;is” and l’d say “room sleeping.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>wanted to move away from all arrows used to guide the mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N031'/>So the process of removing connectives and articles, for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>example, from a sentence, became more like how a painter or
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>visual artist would deal with images. The idea of “room” and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>&quot;sleeping&quot; would be dealt with individually as well as in rela
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>tionship to one another. By erasing I found I got more. The
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N036'/>image became stronger by erasure—the same idea that Ann
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N037'/>Wilson uses when she takes an image and xeroxes it. Wilson
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N038'/>takes an image and erases it by photographing and re-photo
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>ing each new generation—and with each photo the hard
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>edges of the image emerge. I take language and by erasing

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N043'/>The East has provided me with a certain amount of material to

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N045'/>experience could show me the extraordinary in the ordinary.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N046'/>...It is easier for me to relate to Japan than it is to my own
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N047'/>modern culture. I find the Japanese influence is directly and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N048'/>clearly related to the background of being born and raised as
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N049'/>a farm person. My life as a farmer is based on experience of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N050'/>nature. We learned how to plant corn quickly and simply.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N051'/>There was a fragility. Momentary beauty was also a concern
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N052'/>on the farm, as well as the making of the hay. My mother
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N053'/>planted flowers for beauty and pleasure. There was no other
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N054'/>reason.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N055'/>My ancestors developed something from nothing and had
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N056'/>a great passion and love for their objects. This passion, this
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N057'/>simplicity was similar to that of the East. The washed denim
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N058'/>overalls that we all wore on the farm, for example, became a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N059'/>costume of pride—how it was cared for, how often it was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N060'/>washed, how often it was patched, how it faded with each
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N061'/>wearing. This overall became a ritual as basic to the West
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N062'/>(even today) as the care in the preparation of rice to a Japa
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N063'/>nese. Through the East, I was able to find the rituals and sim

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>phors that I try to suggest in my work. When I watch most

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>Our culture is so flat-out pragmatic that the intuitive, the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>inner life, has just about been squeezed to death. The inner

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>ents have been removed from our bread. American culture
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>suspects the inner life because its perceptions consume prag

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>life by filling the emptiness with speed, white bread, white

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>context and rearrange it to make a statement. My text unfolds
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>as I react to content. I get excited when content connects

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>The first thing that comes to me is the arrangement of the

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>never have trouble finding that space. I would say that

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N037'/>this space that I dive into a library and I consume ten books a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N038'/>minute. And I xerox. I get a glut of images. I am an American
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>materialist when it comes to images. I mean, more and more
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>lam a glutton; I am a pig about images. And out of all those
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N041'/>images, I am looking for objects and for people. Objects talk.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N042'/>The bottle in Faust talked. The objects are also people. While

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N051'/>part of the gesture that seems clearest and design it into a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N052'/>sequenced phrase of movements. On stage I move people
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N053'/>around like they were big blocks of sculpture. Movement
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N054'/>units are like an architecture of the body— moving sculpture.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N055'/>They become visual leitmotifs which accompany the pacing,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N056'/>phrasing, and rhythms of sound. These units, which represent
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N057'/>themes or characters, are then interfaced in varying time se
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N058'/>quences to form the play.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N059'/>It takes me about two years working on a play and presenting

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>is very difficult to even begin to speak about where something
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>comes from, but most often it comes from inside my mind
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>and it’s something that l’ve heard. And when I speak about
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>hearing, I am ultimately speaking about remembering, that
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>there is something in the memory that I search out and try to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>recall—but not in the usual Freudian sense. Its not a memory
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>of emotion; it is a sense of feeling and being at a particular
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>point in time where something extraordinary occurred and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>that it was so extraordinary that I cannot even understand it or
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>remember it clearly. It is a distinct feeling, possibly someone
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>would define it as a kind of déjà vu.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>What I work on are concepts that have occurred some
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>where in the past that I try to understand in the present, and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>without speculation, that is where I try to bring together a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>certain period of time—past, present, and future time—and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>put it in one time, to bring it together in a true sense of “right
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>now.&quot; They are things that were heard, or they were sounds, or
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>images that occurred in the inside of my mind, which is like a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>huge tunnel; there is some large dark tunnel that sits up there
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>on my shoulders and there is something that goes on in there
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>that I clearly don’t understand. I try to seek out that sound
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>and define the something that I heard in terms of hearing it,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>seeing it or drawing it or showing it in terms of movement.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N025'/>think Claudia Bruce’s movements define the very state of that
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>&quot;all time” that l’m trying to bring to the work. And her infor
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>mation is usually gathered directly from the text—which is
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>the source of the material
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N029'/>What everyone works from are the words, but the words
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>function without tangible meaning. They are mostly objects
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N031'/>like a painter would paint, like a place on the page. Words
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>which have relationships—individual and on their own. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>if I say&quot;chicken, fence, tree, there are no connectives usual
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>ly and that is all that is stated. It is just simply those relation
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>ships. And then when the reader reads those, they then are
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N036'/>open to form any relationships they wish to those words. The
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N037'/>problem is to try to get that to come close to what I hear and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N038'/>that is what is difficult to talk about. It is definitely something
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>occurring in the ears. I don’t know why. It is a sound pattern;
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>it is a way of listening to something. And I think part of it
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N041'/>comes from participating as someone who watches or listens
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N042'/>to the world rather than participating directly.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N043'/>I need a translator. Sometimes I am able to translate my
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N044'/>own concepts but the best translator of my work is Claudia
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N045'/>Bruce, who has the ability to do the sounds as I hear them and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N046'/>the gestures. Each piece that I make is different. Claudia is the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N047'/>primary performer and collaborator in the work. In many
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N048'/>ways if Claudia had never really been able to do it, it never
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N049'/>would have been done. Claudia’s extraordinary vocal and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N050'/>physical ability have made the work possible as a reality
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N051'/>beyond concepts on paper. A traditional performer has no
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N052'/>idea of what to do with my work, and I don’t expect them to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N053'/>anymore. It is not interesting to them or to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N054'/>Everything is worked out in the process of rehearsal, which is
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N055'/>why I think Ann does more writing than I do; l’ve always had
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N056'/>more rehearsal time. The movements of the piece appear like
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N057'/>photographic processing. l’ve always compared the work to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N058'/>photography, where you take the image into the darkroom
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N059'/>and you print it and as it emerges through chemicals, you
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N060'/>begin to see the image. And that is how I work. I take a group
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N061'/>of people, I take a text; I depend on the text to influence
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N062'/>everything. It’s very focused because you have one place to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N063'/>look. And then out of that emerges a something and whatever
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N064'/>that something I try to define that and take the dust away
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N065'/>and bring it forward and invite it in and ask it to sit down and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N066'/>stay. I ask the performers: “Can we repeat it?” &quot;How do you

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>storytelling of Anna O’s invention of the cathartic method in

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>of the female mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>My alternate play is based on William Carlos Williams’ great
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>epic poem &quot;Patterson.” He wrote it over 20 years while he

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>ization of &quot;Patterson” is based on principles of association,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>variation, and recurrence that suggest a relationship to music.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>This process structure makes it ideally suited to adaptation for
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>performance, dance, music, and visual art. While directing

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>son, working in shifts between the two plays.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>In July 1982 I began writing a series of dialogues while I was
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>staying in the Italian Dolomites, which formed the basic text
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>of Anna O. This serial dialogue was written each day from
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>private mental states I was processing, from architecture as a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>meditation form, and from an evaluation of Freud&apos;s view of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>women in his studies of female sexuality and &quot;histeria.” I was
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>studying the effect of Freud&apos;s view of women on Surrealism,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>which is similar stylistically to my way of working. Conse
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N025'/>quently, I had to reevaluate its origins to free my method
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>from Freudian interpretation. I was reading Freud and think
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>ing about roles for women which would reevaluate Freud in
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>feminist terms. Anna O’s story gave me the form and feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N029'/>perspective I needed to string the beads of the day plays
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>together into the statement I wanted to make about how pub

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>artist-storyteller.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>My source for a visual form with which to present Anna O was
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>found in small stone capellas in the Dolomites. These were
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>shrines to the virgin built in the 16th and 17th centuries on
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N036'/>sites of earlier pagan shrines. I built models, did elevations of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N037'/>them, and made paintings and photographs of their details.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N038'/>A shrine encloses space more than it encloses a thing. The
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>enclosed space that no one enters is the numinous action in
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>the numinous space. For me, there is always a numinous
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N041'/>space, and things are often buried in the ground to create that
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N042'/>space. When you go to Delphi, there is a spring and then
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N043'/>there is a temple. The space was numinous before the build

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>that you do things that are not woman-like. And this throwing
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>aside of all the stereotypes, of all the expected roles that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>women are supposed to do puts an additional burden on peo

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>confronted with the issue of “woman.” You are a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>doing this. After a while it becomes boring and tiring. If you
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>dress a particular way or if you act a particular way, the issue
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>of being a female always becomes part of it, part of anything
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>you do; it’s just never accepted that you could be a person
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>wanting to do something. To a degree, the feminist move

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>The fact that l’ve tried to use women and men equally in the

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>because of public response. When I did Danton’s Death, I had
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>women perform the roles of Robespierre and Camille, which
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>offended many people. Claudia Bruce played Camille and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N029'/>Betty LaRoe played Robespierre. Historically these are men’:
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>roles both in life and in the theater. This show was performed
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N031'/>at La Mama E.T.C. where even Ellen Stewart disagreed totally
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>with my choice and wanted me to recast men in place of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>these women. I refused. I made this choice because Claudia
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>and Betty were the best at the job; they did it best. Whether
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>they were men or women, it didn’t matter to me—they did it
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N036'/>best. ... But it you put women in men’s roles you are making a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N037'/>sexual and political statement.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N038'/>My personal concern is to move on, to go on, to move away
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>from role-playing of any kind. But it still is not possible. Either
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>you are stuck in the roles or you are stuck in the role reversals
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N041'/>It is an impossible conflict at every turn of the road. If l had

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N043'/>would have been much more acceptable to see women acting
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N044'/>in those roles. Because politically the time was more open to

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N047'/>disregards women more often than not—there has been little
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N048'/>progress for women. The theater is heavily funded and fund

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ANN WILSON (continued): 
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>theatrical environments. My arrangements function like char
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>acters. Space has a voice and an atmosphere of its own.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>make taped dialogues for some of the architectural forms and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>objects, which then talk with the performers and move about.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>A bottle dialogue, a pyramid dialogue, a capella dialogue.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>Language need not always be attached to a person or even to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>a voice, for that matter—as anyone who has ever talked to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>cats well knows.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>The cost of theater, about $5,000 for two nights in a small
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>proscenium house, makes perfection unattainable. Such full
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>scale production can only be developed over a month of pub
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>lic performances, but the fees for light and sound technicians
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>and performers are out of my financial realm. So much of the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>work has been theoretical. I have, out of necessity, developed
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>a form of theater presentation in which process receives more
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>emphasis than full stage production. Economic reality is shift
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>ing part of my focus from the proscenium stage to alternative
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>and gallery spaces and close viewing, which in turn has
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>brought about more concentrated detailing of action for audi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>ences which are much closer to the performers.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>Because I work with very young, emerging performers,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>who are not set in any style, I rarely get the polish of a full
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>professional. The performers also do the technical staging
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N025'/>something not possible in the union theater. We work with
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>very little money. Bonnie Stein, my principal performer, has
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>contributed a great deal of energy and motivating spirit toward
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>the completion of my work.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N029'/>came out of the Kerouac generation in the 1950s, from Pitts
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>burgh, Pa. My generation broke space open for the counter
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N031'/>culture that created the avant-garde theater we now work in.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>We broke open marriages and lifestyles; we invented loft
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>living. William Carlos Williams was one of our blueprints. The
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>idea of records of life passage in American rhythms became
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>our mode; dance came from daily life gestures. That idealist
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N036'/>world of our youth is now being erased by expensive com
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N037'/>puter materialism. Fragmentation is the new mode. The old
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N038'/>romantic days of crossing the continent in a beat-up car have
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>been replaced by instant replay.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>When I look at the future and calculate support for the live
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N041'/>moment in life, in theater, I see that I don’t fit into the major
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N042'/>mode. Most of our theater is still European; our thinking is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N043'/>still insecure about our own American voice. Corporate fund
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N044'/>ing, if inclined to cultural PR, is still symbolized by the British
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N045'/>upper-class situation on Channel 13. Italian opera, Cerman
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N046'/>music, and Shakespeare still receive the largest proportion of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N047'/>New York State and national funding. No opera by a senior
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N048'/>American composer like Virgil Thompson has been performed
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N049'/>at the Metropolitan Opera in four decades.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N050'/>Anna O is about the woman who first conceived of the “talk
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N051'/>ing cure” that Breuer and Freud developed. This performance
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N052'/>explores the new psychoanalytic theme—the reevaluation of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N053'/>Freud’s seduction theory. I wanted to make a work that was
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N054'/>confidential, like telling a very close friend of a powerful
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N055'/>dream; about prophecy, jealousy, pain, death, and the end of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N056'/>mourning. I do not know where it is going until it gets there.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N057'/>That is the most exciting thing about the manipulation of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_57' n='N058'/>nonmaterialistic theater. Through the merging of all the per
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N059'/>sonalities involved with my original insight, another much
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N060'/>larger insight evolves: a collaborative presence, not always
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_60' n='N061'/>explainable, not always controllable, but something with a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_61' n='N062'/>very strong life of its own—energies in which my life and the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_62' n='N063'/>artist-performers’ lives are for a moment merged. It always
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_63' n='N064'/>leaves this curious echo in our minds of its actually having
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_64' n='N065'/>lived. An empty stage right after a performance has ended is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_65' n='N066'/>always filled with ghosts. Then there is a dream which is at
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_66' n='N067'/>once an echo and a new site line, and the next play begins.
