				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The idea of a HERESIES issue examining the relationships between women and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>architecture was an outgrowth of projects and research which we had been en
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>gaged in collectively since 1976. Initially the proposal for this issue met with some
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>skepticism both from the HERESIES Collective and other feminists. The feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>analysis of built space has come later than comparable critical evaluations of, for example
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>employment, politics, health, and sex roles. This is no doubt related to the common belief
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that architecture is something only the wealthy can afford or that it is a neutral back
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ground which doesn’t affect people’s lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The notion of the Other, as understood by Simone de Beauvoir when she wrote about
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>women as “defined and differentiated with reference to man,” as “the incidental, the in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>essential,” also applies to architecture. The history and practice of architecture have ig
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>nored, for all their lip service to humanism, the lives, needs, aspirations, work, and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>creativity of women. In this issue we refer to and expand on the humanist tradition of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>architecture through viewpoints, themes, and strategies that demonstrate how the connec
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tions between women’s lives and their environment are to a large extent a consequence of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>political and economic actions, both in a repressive and a liberating sense. Without these
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>concerns architecture, as a profession and as an art, will utterly fail to fulfill its role in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>creating appropriate settings for all human life. The range of articles and projects selected
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>for this issue are intended to open a debate and to create links between feminism and archi
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tecture, both in theory and in practice.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Women taking charge of their own spatial destiny is a theme of several articles and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>projects. Wekerle, Adam/Aitcheson/Sprague, Lindquist, S. Francis, Weisman, Harris,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Marks/Bishop, and Sutton all describe a present-day self-help and community devel

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>long ignored by developers, planners, and designers. Similarly, articles by Wright,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Gilman, Hayden, and Rock show that in the past women have on occasion attempted to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>create alternative spaces for themselves, outside the limited sphere of the single-family
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>home.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The powerlessness women feel in not being able to control their own environments as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>well as their frustration at being relegated to the domestic sphere come out in articles by

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>changing both their roles and their environments. The interior of the house has been the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>only area over which women have had any spatial control. An appreciation of women&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Articles by Nevins, Balmori, Dietsch, and Boutelle focus on the work of women de

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Julia Morgan’s architectural practice owed much to a network of women clients and wom

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>enthusiasm among women which flourished during the Suffrage era. The work of Eileen

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>able question about women and architecture. While this HERESIES issue does not address

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sons: this emphasizes the primary impor

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>condition cannot be renounced; what is at
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>issue is social awareness. As citizens, we
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>form an opinion about our environment
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and pursue a certain ideal; in other words,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>we take a political stand. Thus every ac

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>because the individuals who bring them to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>life are social and political beings. Finally,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>architects: this role demands a confronta

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>variables of an architect’s practice; they
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>precede the actual design of the work.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>While we—as women—struggle to

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>is defined as that of unmasking and re

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>is needed for women runaways and victims of rape. Halfway houses ought to exist for

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>influence on the architectural forms our environments express. Where legislation and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>funding connected with new spaces for women do exist, it is primarily the result of activism
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>by women, women’s movement organizations, and the work of those few but increasing
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>feminists who are in elected or appointed political office. If the future vision for the built

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>mentally supported, then each woman must become her own architect, that is, she must
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>become aware of her ability to exercise environmental judgment and make decisions about
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the nature of the spaces in which she lives and works. Women must act consciously and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>politically. We must ask ourselves who will benefit and who will lose in decisions being

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>value-free nor inclusively human. Feminism implies that we fully recognize this environ
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mental inadequacy and proceed to think and act out of that recognition.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>One of the most important tasks of the women’s movement is to make visible the full

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>20 years. The development of low-income housing has been part of the illusion of progress
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>we’ve seen since World War II, during which time increased lip-service has been paid to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>inequalities based on race, sex, and class. However, despite the rhetoric and the numerous
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>programs designed to alleviate the inequalities, 1978 found more women and Blacks living
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>below the poverty level than those counted in 1968
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The housing projects themselves did much to sustain this illusion of progress. Freshly
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>painted, well-lit, and often quite spacious, the new developments that were a large part of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>urban renewal campaigns undertaken in the sixties were quickly filled with tenants while
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>others signed waiting lists hoping to get in. However, these schemes like many other pro-
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>grams reinforced the psychological oppression of poverty. Their standardized building
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>types easily identified them as “projects” and their bad reputations began to flourish al

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>anyone who is poor in America is likely to forget it. A low-income woman is not only
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>reminded of her status by the things she lacks, but she must identify herself by it, often
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>several times a day. She must identify herself as poor when she goes into the supermarket
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and uses her food stamps, when she takes her children to the doctor with a Medicaid card,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and, if she lives in low-income housing, whenever she gives her address. Her children, as
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>well, must be identified as poor as soon as they enter the first grade and learn to answer
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that most basic question, “Where do you live?

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>are audible through the walls, and one family’s quarrels or celebrations intrude disruptive-
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ly on the lives of neighbors. Thus, the police are called more often than in the suburbs, or
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>in apartment complexes with better acoustic design, adding to the notion that the project is

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>But perhaps the most significant psychological factor of life in the projects is that the

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>have little power. Since the children are crowded into small play areas, there is little
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>opportunity to choose playmates for one’s children, or to keep them from influences or
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>knowledge they are not yet prepared for. Unlike children in most affluent neighborhoods,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>poor children generally have little opportunity to leave their projects at all, due to the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>same economic conditions that put them there in the first place
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Often the close proximity of buildings to the play areas discourages active games such
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>as baseball, which might cause windows to be broken. In fact, in one project I visited in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Boston recently, ball playing of any kind was expressly prohibited, and signs stating that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were posted on every building. What is most disturbing about this is not that children are
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>denied the space and opportunity for the active play they need, but that they are being
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>subtly punished for their parents’ low-income status, and taught to view their own natura
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>exuberance and energy as a negative force by the design of the buildings and layout of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the grounds.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Constructed as cheaply and quickly as possible, the projects are quite simply not built
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to last. This, too, adversely affects the morale of the inhabitants, who find that the poor
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>quality fixtures need replacing sooner than they should, usually at the tenant’s expense. I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>am reminded of the children’s story “The Three Little Pigs,&quot; in which the pig in the brick
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>house has an evident psychological advantage over the one in the straw house. Likewise,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>human inhabitants of a clearly impermanent environment must be reminded daily of their
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>particular vulnerabilities. Yet, when the projects show signs of wear, it is not the architects
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>or builders who are called to task. It is the tenants who are blamed for failing to keep up
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the property, fueling theories that hold the poor responsible for their own misfortunes.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Women, of course, are not the only inhabitants of subsidized housing, though female
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>heads of households frequently lease one half to two thirds of the apartments in a develop-
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ment. For them, the psychological impact of life in the project can be more devastating
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>than it is for male residents. Since nearly all the women in projects are mothers, often with
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>out cars or the means to secure childcare, they do not have the freedom to leave the project
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>for extended periods of time. They spend most of their hours inside their apartments or in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the neighborhood, with few releases for pent-up frustration, and little opportunity to gain
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>another perspective on their situation. Obviously, this can only exacerbate the sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>isolation and powerlessness that accompanies poverty. Without outside stimulation and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>extensive contact with women exploring other options, women in projects find their own
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>lives and what they perceive as their choices increasingly narrowed.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>In outlining the disadvantages inherent in subsidized housing, I do not mean to deny
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>their advantage, which is real and needed economic help. However, there are ways to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>subsidize housing which are not stigmatizing and subtly punitive. Instead of being herded
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>into projects, a low-income family can choose a reasonably priced apartment and have
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>their rent subsidized in the same way it would be in the development. At this time this kind
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of help is very limited. Some families wait for years for their name to come up on a waiting
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>list. In the meantime rules may be changed making them ineligible, the list may be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>scrapped, and the family then accepts their life in the project and does not seek an alterna
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tive
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>At this time there are only individual answers to the challenges of living in an environ-
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ment built for poverty, and, as women, we have come to mistrust individual answers that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>make tokens of a few while effecting no real change. It is for us to remember that poverty
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>is very much a feminist issue, not only because the majority of the poor are women, but
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>also because many of the tactics used to repress the poor are also used on women, what-

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>difficulties in adjusting. The fact that architecture was once primarily a woman’s field has
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>been suppressed until very recently. After twenty years of studying and practicing archi
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tecture, I discovered only two years ago that in nearly all the early civilizations women
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were the original builders, and that they still fulfill this role in many so-called developing
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>countries.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Since building has become a specialized activity dominated by men and male values to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the exclusion of female ones, a growing discrepancy has resulted between the social and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>psychological needs of all human beings and the planned and built environment. The
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>shape an architecture might take in response to female priorities and values cannot be

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>We discovered several other projects in which women have begun to take an active role in

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>following efforts illustrate projects where architects themselves have taken the initiative in

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tive to women. Unique to all these projects, both those described by Wekerle and the ones
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that follow, is the premise that problems of housing and community are closely linked to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>all aspects of one’s life—employment, transportation, day-care, and services. Whether the

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ment began in 1964. Design centers grew
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>out of the politics of the ’60s and all the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>problems of the cities. The community de
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cided what they didn’t want and what they
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>wanted to restore. However, they didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>know if what they were dreaming about
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>could be made real. They needed someone
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to help make the dreams feasible. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>where design centers came in.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>When we first talked about your work
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>you said you weren’t an architect, but
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>your work is so clearly architectural. How
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>did you get started with the design center?
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>In 1972 the New Jersey Society of Archi
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tects was looking for someone who coulo

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>them. I had been involved in community
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>actions. I had lived in public housing and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>had been involved in improving housing
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>conditions for the poor because l was one
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>of the poor. But they were very picky
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>They checked all my references and inter
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>viewed me several times—to make sure I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>could do the job.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Were you aware of architecture as an op
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pressive force?
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>No. Being one of the poor, architecture
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>was one of the last professions I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>anything about. I would never have
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>thought that an architect was responsible.

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I know now that architects do have a re-

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lieve that most social problems begin with
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the physical environment. There is a con

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>you see on TV and in school books. You

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I think I believe in ownership. l’d like

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and end up with a cooperative situation. I

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I would do anything I could to get rid
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of public housing as it is now—under a
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>housing authority. I would abolish high
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>rise towers. Design, density, management,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>maintenance all have to be considered.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>would have a lot more acreage and green
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>space. I would also make them more
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sturdy so people could have permanent
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>homes. The poor are here because of the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>capitalistic system; they are not going to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>go away. They need to have more

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I say down with the high-rise. Give us

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>expressed the connection explicitly:

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Her statement connected the issues that

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The initial response from the town was a

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>were distributed across the state, and the

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and some help from sons. They completed
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the house in less than a week. Three ad

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>houses, and consequently to play a major
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>role in the town’s development. (They
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sponsored several important public build

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>also erected 14 other frame buildings or

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of a single master plan. As we shall see,

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>nonetheless. A Washington journalist said

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>not to a theory, but to the practical neces

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>partitions. In the Central Hotel, dining,

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>giving everyone a share of the possible

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>society difficult and demoralizing. There

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>these beliefs. Small individual bedrooms
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>acknowledged their sexual code, as well
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>as their respect for each woman’s need for
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>some privacy. Large group areas provided
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>room for shared work and meetings. The

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>adopted some of the practicalities that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>had developed in these books on the

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>One aspect of adaptability was the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>multiple use of a space. Unfettered by
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>traditional roles and averse to elaborate
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>decoration anyway, the Commonwealth
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>women reexamined the static definition of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>rooms. An important goal seems to have
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>been spontaneous exchanges through
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>mixed use of a space. This applied to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>guests, for whom the front parlor was a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>community meeting room, the town’s first
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>library, and a Sunday socializing spot.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>The Sisters’ sitting room had a multiple

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>here. The Mt. Pleasant parlor had a simi

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>children in the mornings and for the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>women themselves in the evenings. It also
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>had ingenious arrangements that allowed

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a pure matter of pragmatic business con

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>so easily to outsiders. The continuum

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>encouraged the group’s closeness and,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>simultaneously, facilitated their ties with
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the rest of their community.

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>did not involve protecting a sacred center
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>for themselves. Of course, most women,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>then as now, make a similar adaptation:
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>all the space in a home is shared, so that

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>principally negative, an attempt to escape

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Another important attribute often as
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sociated with women is attention to social

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>spacious gallery system that connected
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the various parts of the hotel. These co

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>porch was an architectural adjunct to the

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Virginia Gray’s adobe house and Caroling’s stained-glass dome can be seen as very
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>personal and idiosyncratic spatial icons, but in fact they evidence a commonly
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>shared sensibility among women. Over a two-year period Leslie Weisman and I
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>collected hundreds of fantasy drawings by women all across the U.S.“ These
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>drawings, representing women’s hopes and frustrations in relation to the built environ
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ment, to shelter and to dwelling, had a great deal in common, and they can be compared
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to the adobe house and the dome. Both the drawings and the built projects are similar in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>form and they reveal a common content. The implied message is the desire to take control
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of space, space being at once the container of and a metaphor for life itself.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The drawings proved very valuable for both the maker of the image and for myself as
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>its facilitator. The very process of making the images was a consciousness-raising experi
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ence. The cumulative result was a trove of images and symbols many women can identify
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with. But while these images can be seen as a point of arrival, they should also be seen
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and I think this is even more important—as a point of departure. Fantasy is often the stage
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>where women remain for lack of opportunities; to believe that the dream cannot be ful
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>filled leads to accepting any situation as stagnant and frustrating. Dreams of change and
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>hope should not remain elusive images in the mind or even on paper. The act of drawing or
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>writing is always the beginning of a more concrete communication.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>These acts are different from conversation, which is remembered selectively—parts
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>forgotten or rearranged in memory and often translated into gossip. Unlike conversation,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>drawing and writing create tangible bases to build on.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>While it has been delightful to see in the fantasy drawings confirmation of a common
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ality of form and content among women, it has been even more rewarding to see in the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>drawings evidence of women taking control of space to meet their own needs, emotions,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and desires. In doing so, women are building on their own and other women’s fantasies
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Isn’t this the meaning behind the seeming coincidence of a woman drawing and writing
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>about her dream in New York (Frances Doughty) and another in California (Caroling)
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>building an almost identical dream as a material reality? Isn’t this why Virginia Gray&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>statements about her adobe house contain so many things in common with not just an
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>other woman’s but with many other women’s fantasies? Don’t we find here evidence of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>what some call &quot;female sensibility”? Aren’t these signs of a common foundation for the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>expression of a uniquely female imagery of built form? Doesn’t this show a creative process
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that emphasizes those qualities our culture associates with the female principle, with a
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>greater reliance on feeling and intuition, on things not too carefully planned by choice?
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Although the visions and processes presented here record individual endeavors, they
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>provide us with the hope that is needed to move and build beyond idle dreams and desires.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>When we see that these individual solutions are not singular but exemplary, we realize that
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>what is possible for one becomes possible for all. And what works for one woman’s needs
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>may be translated, as these projects suggest, and expanded to meet the needs of a group.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The form achieved is both personal and collective, resonating with common meanings as it
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>is communicated to others.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Virginia Gray’s adobe house is located
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in Santa Fe, an area rich in vernacular
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>adobe construction, a building tradition
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>continued by the native Pueblo popula
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tion and adopted by the Anglo settlers.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Virginia Gray settled there some 20 years
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ago after college and became a potter.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Though she no longer makes pots, her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>knowledge and empathy with the ways of

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>house. The original rectangular house
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>designed by a male architect friend, was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>built ten years ago. This house was ser
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>viceable and comfortable enough, but Vir
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ginia eventually felt an urgent desire to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>make a space that would be more closely
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>responsive to her own life. It would seem
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>from the juxtaposition of the original
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>house and Virginia’s own addition that
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>her impulse to break out of the rectangle
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>results in an almost literal explosion
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>through the wall. But in the end the new
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>space does not entirely replace the old;
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>rather, it establishes with it a dialogue be
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tween hard and soft, straight and curved,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>static and flowing spaces. Opposites are
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>subtly transformed into options.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The new space seems to rush out and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>around the fireplace (a metaphor for the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>birth of this space?), which is like a tree
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>trunk serving as a pivot for both horizon
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>tal and vertical movement. One climbs up
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>this &quot;tree&quot; into an aerie—a very private,

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>itself as one approaches it by foot from
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the road. Its entrance faces the path, in

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>unification, but one that changes with
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>every movement and change of light. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>difficult not to experience a sense of in

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>etc.) should always match. Women care

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;Brightness&quot; is a word recurring often
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in the Los Adobes woman’s palette of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ideas. But an article is &quot;bright&quot; and &quot;shin

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ing, and straightening their homes. When
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>they discuss other women in the village,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>approval might be prefaced by the ulti
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>mate compliment a woman can render:
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Mary keeps a really clean house. Clean
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>liness is not merely precautionary—rath
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>er, it is part of an aesthetic which directs

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tradition. Women say that their mothers

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>homes. Cleanliness is a deliberately chosen
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>way of life. Cordelia has often remarked,

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>be arranged symmetrically. Mary told me
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that she arranged two very different
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>plaques on either side of a mirror so her
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>living room wall would be &quot;balanced.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Clusters of objects also prevail in every
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>home. These are usually collections of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>small items displayed within a larger one.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>For example, I counted nine whatnot
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>shelves in Lucy’s living room alone, each
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>one filled with small “pretties. Some of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>these were purchased especially to fill the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>shelves. The balancing and clustering of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>objects seem to help control clutter, im

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Cordelia said: &quot;I like all the little pretties.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>The more there are the better I feel.&quot; But
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>she orders them in clusters on shelves and
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>table tops.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Clusters are often bounded on larger
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>flat surfaces by placing them on crocheted

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>kind of patterning. This also helps to im

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>doilies and cloths serve to mediate be

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>lamp). The theme of mediation or protec

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>covering. Lacework may cover whole

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>became a rural slum. Even so, its bustling

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Sra. Mina lives on her farm. She is 80
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>years old and the mother of 12 children,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>all of whom are living. The farm is not big
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>enough to support her now very extensive
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>family; and most of them live in the near
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>by town. At present two daughters and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>their families live with her.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Sra. Mina came to the area in 1922
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>with her first compañero; they built a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>house on the same site where she now
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lives. This first house was a two-room
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>structure of wattle and daublike construc
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tion, with a detached kitchen. In 1932 she
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>met her second husband, and they ex
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>panded the house to accommodate a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>growing family. In 1950 a married daugh
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ter built herself a house, where she lived
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>until she separated from her husband. The
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>husband stayed and she returned to the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>town. Later this daughter sold the house
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to a younger brother, who brought his
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>wife to live there. Another of Sra. Mina’s
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sons built himself a house in 1961, which
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>he demolished six years later in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>use the materials on a house he was build
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ing in town. In 1965 the maternal house
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>was substantially rebuilt because the fam
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ily wanted a new house in which to cele-
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>brate a wedding. Like all the past con
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>struction, this house was built collectively
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>by kinsmen, using thatch and bamboo
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>from the farm. Sra. Mina provided food
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and drink for all those who helped.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Sra. Mina spends many of her daytime
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>hours under the verandah, or in the cor
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>redor, as it is called. There she does her
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>household chores and minds the young
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>children while her daughters work on the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>farm. The corredor faces the patio and as

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>space she engages them in conversation.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>She has a great affection for the landscape
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and for the trees which have given her a

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Over the years her children and their

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the farm for periods of time. This has
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>usually happened in times of emergency.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In the case of one son, he became indebted

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and fell behind with the rent. So he and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>his family returned to the farm for a year.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>In this way the farm has provided a safe
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>refuge for family members.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Permanence, evolution, and positive
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_14_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>attitudes characterize Sra. Mina’s housing

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her family still lives there. At 18 she went
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to the Cauca Valley and found a job as a
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>domestic servant in Cali. There she met
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>her compáñero, and in the time they were
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>together she had 10 pregnancies. Only
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>five children survived and she almost died
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>on two occasions. The second time she
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>nearly bled to death while lying in the

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Sra. Rojo has worked intermittently as
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a day-laborer; her compañero works as a
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>regular employee in the canefields. Sever

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>with some basic necessities. Not strong

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Sra. Rojo felt her poverty keenly. There
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>was not enough food for the children. In
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>desperation she sent a letter to a charitable
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>radio program, requesting that they find
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>jobs as domestic servants for her nine
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and eleven-year-old daughters. She is illit

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>me very badly because I owe her four
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>months&apos; rent. Two hundred pesos. A sick

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_15_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Perhaps as a result of many years of

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Sra. Rojo’s oldest son recalls the num
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ber of times they moved. Before coming
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to Puerto Tejada they lived in 10 different
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rented rooms in the north of the valley. In

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>times. Sometimes they fell behind with
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the rent; other times there were problems
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with neighbors or landlords. With one
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>house they rented near the canefields, the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>owner stripped the roof tiles from the

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>cause she owed two months’ rent. In 18
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>years the family moved 23 times; rarely
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>did they have more than one room and

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Sra. Mina and her family. As the family
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>grew or contracted, so buildings were
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>added or taken away. As social events
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>occurred (the wedding, for example),
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>buildings were refurbished or modified.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>adaptability and change, whereas the for

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Dwelling occurs by juxtaposing a matrix
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>of fixed walls with a matrix of spatial inci
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>dents. The wall, in Western architecture,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>is the primary architectural element. It
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>distinguishes between inside and outside;
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>it creates a boundary and a support for
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>shelter. According to psychohistorians of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the built environment, the wall is associ
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ated in the Western unconscious with the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>memory of the mother. In sources ranging
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>from nursery rhymes (Humpty Dumpty

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the visual arts, the wall has dual connota

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>as separation and denial. The wall matrix
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>of the House of Meanings is open-ended.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>As will be seen in the actual projects, a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>physical wall does not always exist where
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>one might seem indicated. Sometimes the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>walls simply suggest a potential space to

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>So long as our homes had twenty feet

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ten feet of stone steps at the front door,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>we submitted to the lateral pressure un
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>complainingly. We took our air and light
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>at the two ends of the house; we ignored
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the neighbor whose bed was within a foot
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of ours, because the party-wall was solid
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and well deadened. We called our vertical

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>house,&quot; and while lamenting at times it
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>lack of physical comfort, we did not feel
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>that its life was attacked. It was still &quot;the

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>But the apartment houses increased so
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>rapidly that levels of domestic life in New
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>York became as varied as its rocky sub
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>strata; and then, under the same pressure,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the kitchens were squeezed out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>flats, and the apartment hotel appeared.

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>carried the home upward, by the dozen,

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>A little more squeezing—the kitchen

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>often it, too, disappears. The children?

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>make no provision for children—they
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>don’t want any. The children are but few
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in these sky palaces, and they look out of

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>providing for them at all. We shirk it.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>And then what happens? What does

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>heavy, but there is less worry. He works
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and pays the freight. The woman, relieved

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>There is no real reason that a man and

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>apartment house. We did not build pri

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>theories of social evolution. Rather than

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>In Women and Economics she stated that

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>evolution of the human race, she believed,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>would be hastened by removing domestic

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>possible for all women to be economically
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>independent of men. Thus, she argued
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that the development of socialized domes
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tic work and new domestic environments
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>should be seen as promoting the evolution
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of socialism, rather than following it. This
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was her original contribution.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>able to make the dream seem so tangible,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>so sensible, so extraordinarily realizable
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to people of common sense and good will,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that tens of thousands of people began

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Although the dream was broad, the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>experiment was narrow. The failure of her

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>New York may be traced to Gilman’s
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>optimistic rather than realistic view of
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>women’s employment patterns. By 1910,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>25 percent of all women were employed,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and 10 percent of all married women.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>represented the fondest hopes of a new
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>generation of educated women who did
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>not wish to sacrifice their careers for
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>motherhood. However, they were the ex
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ceptional women of their time. The house
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>wife who did not work for wages was still

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>A second obstacle to success was Gil

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>services, as the setting for feminist moth
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>erhood. This created difficulties for the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Socialist Party women, who found that
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Gilman’s program left them without suit

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>housewives. Gilman depended on female
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>professionals and female capitalists to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>lead the way. Not only did she reject class
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>conflict, which the Socialists knew how to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>analyze, but she also rejected housewives’

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>developed, she failed to convey to Social

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Gilman did aid Socialist Party women
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to fight cultural conservatives within the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that housework was a woman’s job.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Spargo had a particular hatred for femi

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>changed a great deal. Like the work world,

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>life, particularly the values placed on nur

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>a permanent home for themselves in the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>kitchen.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>If we look at the kitchen as a crucible
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of change, we can see aspects of the larger
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>society intensified in its heat. Social rela
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tions have been molded to fit the needs of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>monopoly capital. In the work world we
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>see clock-oriented efficiency determining
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the way workers relate to one another.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>As workers are pressed into a routine,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>their social contacts become less personal

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>still carry elements from a more personal
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>pre-capitalist society. Despite their isola

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>have had a powerful impact on social
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>values, in particular on the way we relate
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to each other. It is for this reason that
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>women’s relationship to the kitchen, the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>emotional center of the home, has become
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the target of much outside manipulation
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>A dominant feature of kitchen design
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>has been its separation from the rest of the

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>per household still influences design. The
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>physical size of the kitchen has also
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>changed, shrinking and swelling several
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>times during this century in proportion to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the activities rooted there. Focusing on
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>form, we can point to the disappearance
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and reappearance of the big kitchen table,

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>appliances. And parallel to the alterations
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of the physical space, we see transforma
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tions affecting the activities within the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>kitchen: woman’s role shifted from pro
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ducer to consumer; women entered and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>were ushered out of the labor force only
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to reenter again; family size decreased;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>household composition was redefined;

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>In viewing these changes, we see a

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>By the First World War, kitchen design was beginning to change. The stove shrunk in

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>(no longer the parlor). This arrangement was to hold for another decade, until those habits

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_7_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>By creating the efficiency kitchen, builders had almost wiped out those harder-to-define

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>entity called the “island,” long the darling of home design magazines, came of age. The

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The following is a condensation of a conversation among two artists, Donna Dennis and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Maureen Connor, and two members of the Editorial Collective for Issue 11, Debby Nevins
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and Jane McGroarty. The work of both Dennis and Connor is directly inspired by imagery
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>connected to architecture and the domestic environment. For the past eight years, Dennis
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>has made small buildings, many of which have been houses or motels—the domestic en
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>vironment on a public scale. Connor’s organdy sculptures are based on intricate, tradition
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>al napkin-folding patterns. These fabric sculptures are self-supporting; their structural
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>strength is a result of the folding process.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Debby: The making of art can transform, conquer, and exorcise emotions. What are your
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>autobiographical associations to your work? Does your work have metaphorical content?
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Donna: I moved quite a bit when I was young. When my father got back from World
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>War II, we moved to Washington, D.C. My mother somehow couldn’t make a break with
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>her parents; my mother and my sister and I would spend every summer in Ohio while my
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>father stayed in Washington, except for a few weeks when the family took a vacation to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>gether. We would just set out by car without hotel reservations. We would drive to the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Rockies or somewhere else in the West. There were often times when it would be getting
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>dark and we would go past all these motels with the “No Vacancy” sign turned on. It was a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>very special time in a way; it was sort of scary yet I was with the family—secure and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>insecure.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>There was also a tradition of being interested in architecture. My mother, coming from
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Ohio, always wanted to go to New England and see the architecture. We would go through
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>these old New England towns and she would say, “Look at that door,&quot; and I thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>&quot;Yuck&quot;—you know, the Williamsburg kind of thing. Somehow I felt my own kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>interest. I was attracted to the sleazy places. I also have an early memory of going to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Boston and visiting the Old North Church. I must have imagined it being like one of those
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>restored houses that she liked. It was in a slum and really decrepit and I felt sorry for it.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>My emotional connections to architecture have a lot to do with the work that I do.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>As l became involved in architecture, I started noticing certain buildings in New York.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>l’d see an old storefront, all mirrors and beautiful; then it would have a “For Rent” sign,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and later I would see the building torn down... and I must have felt as if I had a mission to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>do a piece about its being forgotten.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>All my pieces take me a year. I may do maquettes and drawings. I like that a piece in
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>volves an entire year of my life. l’m completely self-taught in construction. In the Two
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Story House I built, I built the roof of the porch three times before I got it right. Three
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>whole roofs. But there is a part I really like to do—the surfaces, the tiles. It is really very
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>meditative. I can sort of rest in between—trying to figure out how to do a roof or some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>thing—and I just paint or rule off these squares and then I paint them.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Jane: In working on a piece for a year, which has repetitive, meditative parts, does the his
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>tory of its making affect you later?
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Debby: I was wondering if you remembered the making of the work in a personal sense,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>connecting specific parts of the building with specific events or feelings in your life?
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Donna: A friend of mine died when I was about halfway through making the Two-Story
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>House. When it was finished I dedicated it to him. He had liked it a lot and it became a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>memorial. He was 35 and the first friend of mine who died. I am just at the age when you
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>realize that you are going to die one day. I thought a lot about the room upstairs with the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>light—it was a place for him spiritually. The downstairs was more public. The whole
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>piece, in the end, meant something about going on. The house was painted and looked like
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>something that was going through a renovation and was about to take on a new life. One
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>could imagine that it had been a private home and somebody new had bought it and it had
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>just gotten a fresh paint job.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Jane: Your work is architectural in a sense, but the scale is not architectural. How do you
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>arrive at the size?
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Donna: When I made my wall panels in the late 1960s, they were 10 feet tall. Then, when I
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>first became involved with feminism, I decided that I had been trying to seduce the male
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>world by working so large. A lot of men were doing big art. So I began to work in my own
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>size. The hotels were 5’ 812&quot; tall—my height. I still use that scale.

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Debby: Maureen, what kind of autobiographical associations do you make to your work?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Maureen: In my family, women were always setting elaborate tables and making fancy
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>meals, especially my grandmother. I remember great concern about what was put on the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>table—the right kind of tablecloths, the right kind of napkins—and all that.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The work is certainly about transformation. It is also about the idea of pushing the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>limits of fabric—how far could I push without anything in there doing the supporting? For
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>me it was really a metaphor—fabric being very fragile and delicate.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Debby: A metaphor for what?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Maureen: For myself...this fragile thing that is being pushed as far as it can go and is able
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to stand up and be tough
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Debby: Would you want to, for aesthetic reasons, go bigger
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Maureen: I would. In fact, I had the idea of seeing if I could actually try one that was tent
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>size...a small architectural scale; especially like the pleated column (Column A). Thal
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>piece has a lot of layers, each layer supports the next layer, and each layer is a little bigger.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I wondered how many more layers I actually could put on that piece and still have it stand
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>up. I have never seen any other structural use of fabric like this napkin folding where the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>fabric is the structure and doesn’t need any other support.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Jane: It is like folded plate construction where the planes of the material provide support
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>rather than sticks holding things up.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Debby: Do you think of your work as feminist?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Maureen: Yes, I do, but especially on the personal level. Pushing the limits of fabric re
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>flects my own feelings of being pushed, pushing my female side. I see it as the inverse of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>macho, so feminine yet tough. For me napkin folding is one of the most beautiful things
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>that I have discovered that women did, that women invented. Men certainly invented
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>some napkin-folding patterns, but it is clearly a woman’s tradition, a woman’s art. Women
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>made all those folds and created those objects, except, of course, the waiter in a restaurant.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>However, women’s forms of expression carry a certain history of oppression, like the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>napkin-folding tradition. What are they, if not partly symbols of oppression? Women
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>made these beautiful objects that were destroyed the moment people sat down to dinner.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Middle-class women had the time to produce incredible ornaments because they-were not
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>allowed to venture beyond the home. Poor women would be away from their own homes
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>folding napkins for someone else. Yet these napkins created beauty in everyone’s lives and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>are testaments to women’s skill and imagination in designing beautiful environments. Part
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of doing the napkin-folding pieces is for me not just a celebration of this imagination but
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>also the recognition of the pain they express and represent.

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>This project deals with three main concerns: Bessie Smith, the blues, and the American
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>monument.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Bessie Smith was born about 1898 in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She grew up singing in the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>church until, at age 14, she met and sang for her idol Gertrude “Ma” Rainey, the most
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>famous of the early blues singers. Ma Rainey took Bessie with her in her Rabbit Foot Min-
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>strel Show, which toured the deep South. Bessie was able to learn all about the vaudeville
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>techniques of the minstrels, yet her own singing retained little of their theatrical manner
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and relied instead on the gospel approach to singing. “When you went to see Bessie and she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>came out, that was it,” recalled a fellow musician. &quot;If you had any church background,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>like people who came from the South as I did, you would recognize a similarity between
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>what she was doing and what those preachers and evangelists from there did, and how
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>they moved people....Bessie did the same thing on stage.&quot; Her singing style, which owed
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>much to Ma Rainey, relied on strong “center tones,” around which she would work her
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tune. Thus, the familiar melody of the blues tune would be reinterpreted for the audience

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>took the blues with them, thus enlarging its venue, and they raised its status to a valid
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>form of formal entertainment for the Black community (that is, one for which people
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>would pay an admission charge). The blues, however, retained a seemingly salacious ir
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>reverence that made the church-goers condemn its influence on impressionable children.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The blues spoke of the same matters that gospel did, but with a secular, immediate, and

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>toward architecture. Born in Ireland in

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>she apprenticed herself to a craftsman

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>became highly skilled at the craft and was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>able to produce magnificent designs using

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>In 1902, at age 23, she settled in Paris
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>where she remained until her death. In

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Until very recently, it was thought un

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>This may have made her seem a dilettante.

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>incorporated in the living room, visually
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>secluded by a fireplace. The wall behind

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and is blocked from the rest of the room
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>by a low wall. The living room thus be-

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and the furniture it contains. Multifunc
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tionality is evident in the other rooms as
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>well. Master bedroom and guest room are
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>both fitted with sinks and desks. Beds are
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>designed with upholstered backs and are
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>also thought of as divans.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Similar to her conceptual thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>about rooms, diversity and option are

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sponses to the environmental conditions.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Her work shows a sensitivity to the cycli-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cal rhythms of the days and the seasons.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Her treatment of windows is a case in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>point. At least three types of windows are
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>used: sliding and folding on two sizes,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>pivoting, and double-hung. Some win
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>dows are protected by wooded shutters
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with movable louvers. The larger, floor
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to-ceiling sliding and folding windows
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>along the living room wall are shielded by
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>awnings over the terrace. Canvas also
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>surrounds the terrace. In the winter the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>canvas can be taken down to allow the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sun to warm the legs of people sitting
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>there. With this combination of window
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>layerings and canvas to filter light and air,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a finely modulated and subtle range of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>temperatures is possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The furniture designed for the house
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>elaborates Gray’s view of an environment
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>as a finely calibrated response to human
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>needs. In her analysis of the function of an
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>object, she deals with a variety of ways it
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>can be used over time. Her furniture, like
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>her spaces, is conceived of not as isolated
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>elements but as participants in a web of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>actions that make up the drama of life.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Gray understood, in a detailed way,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the use of an object over the span of a day
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>or throughout the year, integrating this
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>understanding into her work. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>broadest sense, then, “time” becomes a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>component of her analysis of functional
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ism. As a result, many of her objects have
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>a quality of physical transformability that
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>amplifies or extends the number of ways
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the objects can be used within the primary
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>activity they serve. Note, for instance, her
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>small side table consisting of a metal arm
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ature and a circular piece of glass. Made
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>during the period Roquebrune was under
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>construction, this table is shown in photo
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>graphs of the house. Cantilevered off a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>metal column, the glass top is secured to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the column by a metal pin, which fits into
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>a series of holes along the length of the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>column. This allows the table to serve as a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>coffee table or side table. In addition,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>because its top is supported only at the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>edge, it can slide into position as an over
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>the-bed table. Pulled close to a person
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>sitting in a chair (possible because of its
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>open-circle base), the table can be used to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>serve informal meals.

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>glasses from being knocked off. This

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of the legs adjusted to convert it into a

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Gray’s concern with how rooms and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>objects are used over time led her to ac
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>knowledge, in her design, aspects of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>everyday life, such as the unmade bed or
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>reading and eating in bed, aspects that
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>had never been explored by other design
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ers. She was one of the first, if not the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>first, to design colored sheets. She argued
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that they would provide color and beauty
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in a room when the bed was unmade, as it
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>so often is. In the guest bed/alcove, she
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>designed a small table that swings out
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>from the wall over the bed. The table’s easel
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>can be adjusted so that when raised, the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>table can be used for reading; when low
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ered, it can be used for eating or writing.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>This pivoting bed table, implying the ro

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>profound inspiration. Gray noted that &quot;it
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>is necessary to give to the work of art the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>form which best responds to the spon
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>taneous gesture, or the instinctive reflex
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>which corresponds to its use.&quot;3
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>In addition to her exceptionally so
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>phisticated attitude toward the problem
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of function, her designs are characterized
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>by a quality of &quot;body-centeredness.&quot; The
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>primary focus of each object’s design is
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the physical movement and comfort of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the user. She also took into account the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>four senses, in a somewhat more pro
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>nounced and refined manner than other
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>designers. Her use of cork for table tops
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>eliminated the harsh, clanging sound of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>an object against glass; she used fur throws
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>on beds and soft layerings of cushions to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>stimulate the sense of touch; she used fil

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the kitchen to one side of the house and

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Gray described her work anthropo

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>her house a living organism.&quot; In a sense,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>because of the great number of objects in

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Finally, the inevitable question: Is there

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>work? We can speculate that Gray’s finely
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tuned awareness of the way objects are
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>used—a level of sensitivity not seen in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>other outstanding personalities in the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>modern movement—derives from a per

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>sional architect, Gray was on two counts
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>an outsider to the world of professional

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>an expatriate. Perhaps for this reason, as
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>well as her own perceptiveness, she was
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>able as early as 1920 to criticize the mod
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ern movement in a way that has held
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>widespread acceptance only since the

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>raries for their rigid theory, emphasis on
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>functionalism, and technological solutions
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to the exclusion of the expression of sen
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>suality and spirituality in architecture.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>She did not reject the use of new techno

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>did warn against an oversimplification of
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>architecture and the use of a housing pro
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>totype as a stencil for building. For her,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the prototype was to be constructed in the

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>had to respond to the “habits” of our time,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to an understanding of the needs and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>emotions of the individual. This emphasis
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>on the understanding of society’s needs,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the stress on spirituality, and the multi

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Today architects are searching for an

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ings. Gray’s work provides a model for a
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>contemporary architecture. The symbol
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ism of the house at Roquebrune derives
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>directly from the specificity of the pro

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>for architecture will result in an extreme

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>which are as poor as they are limited.

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>unfortunate circumstance.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>I believe that the majority of people
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>misunderstand the meaning of this word

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>was Reich’s use of panels—whether fabric

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>cluding a multi-unit apartment block, a

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>story houses. A gallery encircled this hall,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>under which Gropius constructed a com

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tion, Reich played a prominent role as
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>designer of the industrial exhibits, which
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>occupied the entire gallery level. She also
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>designed several apartment units and a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>one-story house. The latter, along with
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Mies’s adjacent residence, became the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>focal point of the exhibition. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>connected by a wall, forming a shared
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>courtyard, the two houses were not con
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ceived as a unified composition. The
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>physical connection between them seems
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to have been made as a gesture toward
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>forming a communal space, to counter the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>criticism that these single-story detached

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>were solitary luxuries. They inevitably
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>stood in contrast to the more economic

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>located directly behind them.

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>plans of the houses. Mies’s plan combined
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>aspects of the Barcelona Pavilion with

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The wall connecting the two houses, which
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>extended into the interior, separated the

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>house. In Mies’s plan, however, this wall
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was not as crucial to the functional divi

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The furniture in Reich&apos;s interior was
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>primarily from the Bauhaus workshops at
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Halle,? although many pieces were of her
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>own design. Particularly dramatic was the

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The &quot;white materials&quot; included the velvet

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>combined aspects of Mies&apos;s Weissenhof
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>lounge chair and Tugendhat chairs, but

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_8_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>both of Reich’s apartments—a studio of

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Reich’s work is her overall drive toward a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>minimal aesthetic and the constancy of
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>this approach in all levels of her work,

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>buildings. In collaborating with Mies,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Reich was the more austere of the two:
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>while his credo became “less is more,

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>never escaped the confines of tradition.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_9_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>This is especially apparent in his later

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>into areas for conversation and study.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Similarly, her apartment was divided

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>too insubstantial for public buildings, and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>they turned to the Richardsonian Roman
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>esque for its handsome, massive solidity
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>which at the same time was unpretentious
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and did not dominate the surrounding
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>naturalistic landscape. By the 1880s

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>to guide them. They evolved a new set of

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>The chief tenets of the reform park
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>were small size, location within working-

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Accordingly, designers created separate

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dear Reader:
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I wish to outline certain problems of women faculty in architectural education. I want to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>write of causes as well as symptoms, but must do so only through generalizations, though
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>these are grounded in personal recollection and collectively shared impressions. I am hope
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ful that you will believe me; for the trials of a woman faculty member within a department
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>or school of architecture are formidable and incessant. She functions principally as teacher
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and colleague; yet she enjoys but secondary status in an often outrageously unfair world,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>run by and for the benefit of her male colleagues and governors.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>In professional architectural education both the curriculum and the greatest prestige
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>center on teaching within the “design studio” sequence of courses. The design studio is, in
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>fact, the raison d’être of any school of architecture—just as the activity of designing re
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>mains at the core of any practicing architect’s concept of his or her professional role. All
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>other basic areas of study are auxiliary to the design studio.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I have never known nor have I ever heard of any instance where a woman has been
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>primarily engaged to teach technical courses. If there have been such cases, I would be sur
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>prised to learn that they were anything but short-term or ad hoc appointments made by
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the (invariably male) chairman or dean (Is it REALLY true that a woman lacks “the scien
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tific mind”?). In the secondary architectural disciplines (indeed, because secondary), it is in
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>teaching history that women are most likely to be found. Occasionally, history is linked
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>with &quot;theory.&quot; But theory is an area of study speculative by definition and philosophical
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>by implication. Given this intellectual thrust, it is not surprising that the teaching of theory
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>is delegated to the studio instructor—who is, conveniently enough, almost always male
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>(Can women REALLY be trusted with something so SERIOUS as theory?).
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>The travails of women on architecture faculties become really telling when one consid-
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ers the various teaching formats: the seminar, the lecture, and—above all—the studio.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The seminar presents the least number of problems and the greatest freedom from
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>stereotyped responses to a woman by students. This discursive situation permits the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>female instructor to be understood and accepted more readily as an individual. As the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>seminar is also usually the format for more specialized courses, often in history and design
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>theory, it is usually populated with advanced undergraduate or graduate students, who
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tend to be more mature intellectually and socially.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>In lecture courses, however, women frequently encounter the consequences of the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>diminished intellectual credibility society assigns to them. The format presumes that the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>lecturer is accepted by the students (generally a younger and far larger group) as an
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>&quot;authority figure” in the field. Woe to the woman who automatically assumes that she can
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>command the lectern with the same respect as her male counterpart. Students tend to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>expect a theatrical savoir-faire—a commanding physical presence, much gesticulation, and
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>a booming voice all help. In the absence of an orator, architectural students will happily
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>settle for the charismatic, heroic “master designer” (a curiously architectural fascination).
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Pity the female lecturer who is neither a Barbara Jordan nor a Le Corbusier. Many of these
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>problems are without question reinforced by the continuing reluctance of schools of archi
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tecture to invite female lecturers to speak in their guest-lecture series or to include us as
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>participants (let alone moderators) in symposia. All this unreasonably enhances the vul
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>nerability of the woman who finds herself a lecturer.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Yet the problems women face in the lecture hall pale by comparison with the design
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>studio setting. It is in the studio where issues of credibility and control are most acutely
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>felt, principally because of intense and insidious sex-role stereotyping. How can a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>match her students’ expectations of an omniscient (male) design “guru”? In format the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>studio is the opposite of the lecture situation; it involves the most intimate, personal con
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>tact between student and teacher. You might think this to be the ideal situation for a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>woman to be accepted on individual, not stereotyped, grounds. But you would be quite
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>wrong.

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The design studio mentality originated in the atelier format of 19th-century architec-
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tural apprenticeship. Especially in its charette aspects (when students devote themselves to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the completion of a project, often for days on end without sleep), the studio remains
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>vestigially symbolic of the sadomasochistic initiation rites undergone by pubescent boys
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>desirous of entering into professional manhood. The architectural studio presupposes a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;captain-at-the-helm,&quot; “cloak-in-the-breeze” type of instructor—a supremely male figure
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>commanding respect through sheer presence. For those male studio instructors who fail to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>meet this authoritarian, father-figure ideal, a suitable substitute is the architectural “coach&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rousing his team to victory, a “comrade-in-arms” or avuncular &quot;buddy-figure” willingly
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>standing by his students while they forge through the muck and mire of aesthetic creation.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The studio critic is thus the quintessentially male architectural persona, and it stands to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>reason that the female studio instructor has an inordinately difficult time demonstrating
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>(should she ever care to) either that she is as much a &quot;buddy” as her male colleagues or
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>(heaven forbid) that she is entitled to the same respect.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>A woman’s presence as a studio instructor is taken neither as seriously nor as authori
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tatively as that of her male colleagues. Almost invariably she is hired to teach in the lower
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>most years of the design studio sequence (the &quot;elementary school” syndrome). Often she-is
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>called to task by her students for unquestionably trivial infractions, which (not surprising
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ly) would be overlooked in a male. An alleged offense might be an occasional overly
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>complex design assignment (or an overly simplistic one). Or there might be a vague feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that she is playing favorites by seeming to spend more time with some students and less
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with others (Does it have anything to do with mother’s not paying enough attention?).
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Normal attempts by female critics to enforce the usual level of rigor in the studio (includ
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing final grading) may be perceived as untoward and unfair (father disciplines; mother
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>comforts). The double-standard survives, as expected: all such assumed transgressions are
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>far more readily excused in the case of male critics.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Many of the problems facing women in architectural education are shared by women
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in other academic fields. Difficulties with male colleagues arising out of competitive fears,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>inability to separate sexual from professional spheres, reduced credibility, imagined in
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>timidations, and all the rest are by no means unique to architecture. Yet all these issues
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>(and more) are certainly exacerbated in architectural education because of the intensified
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>machismo ideal long associated with the role of the architect in society (Remember How-
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ard Rourke?). To design a building—indeed, to build a design—continues to confer the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>semblance of immortality. I suspect that in architecture schools, which tend to have facul
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ties populated with male architects doing little actual building, ego problems, resulting
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>from secret professional frustrations (Those who cannot DO, TEACH instead??), become
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>all-the-more exaggerated by the presence of women on the faculty
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>I write to you from the ivy-covered halls of an institution long-hallowed in the world of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>architectural education. A landmark class-action suit on behalf of all women academics at
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>this university was recently filed in federal court—poignant testimony, indeed, to count
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>less frustrations and unconscionable mistreatment throughout this university, and in aca
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>demia everywhere
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Yet it is clear that many of the dilemmas women face in architectural education, if not
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>in other fields, could be vastly ameliorated simply by the sustained recruitment and reten
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>tion of far more female faculty (especially as design critics). The “male persona” of the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>studio critic can, I am certain, be de-mythified. The more women faculty there are, the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>more likely we are to be perceived in individual rather than generic terms. The affirmative
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>action program at this university ensures that there is one woman on this architecture
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>faculty at any given time (lassure you, more than one at a time is sheer miscalculation). In
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>so many university affirmative action programs it is hiring that seems to be the sum and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>substance of the commitment made to women (But what of reappointment? Promotion?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>TENURE??). The &quot;revolving door&quot; policy used by most male academics to bring women to

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>simply no longer acceptable. All this, and here too—at a university whose president, mind
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>you, last year proclaimed publicly that:
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>I regard affirmative action as an imperative—both moral and social. ... We should value
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>the enrichment which the increased presence of such persons has already brought to our
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>community. It is that enriching influence we seek to expand and &quot;nurture&quot; [my emphasis)
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>through our affirmative action efforts.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>reached there at quarter to five, but you
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>had already fled five minutes before. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>too bad not to have had the chance of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>speaking to you, as I am off again to the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Oaks on Thursday and shall not be back
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in New York until late on.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>unknown today.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Beatrix Farrand, née Jones, lived from
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>1872 to 1959. She received her profession

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>It was 1892, and the private railroad car

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>reads:

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_11_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>So Farrand saw Olmsted’s last two jobs
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_11_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>as they were being designed and built: the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>grounds of the Columbian Exposition and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>those of &quot;Biltmore,&quot; Vanderbilt&apos;s estate in
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>North Carolina.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>It was not Olmsted, however, but two
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women who were the main molders of the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ideas and forms of Farrand&apos;s gardens. This
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>is a rare instance of a professional woman
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with female role models. One of these
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>women was Farrand’s aunt, the novelist
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Edith Wharton;? the other was the English
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>landscape architect Gertrude Jekyll.” The
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>influence of both Wharton and Jekyll can
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>be seen in Farrand’s one extant garden,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Dumbarton Oaks
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>This is the garden Farrand considered
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>&quot;the best and most deeply felt of a fifty
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>year practice.&quot;1° It consists of a series of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>walks around a hilly site. The house sits
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>on the highest point. The garden’s design
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>concept resembles Edith Wharton’s de
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>scription (as will be seen later) of the gar
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dens of Italian villas—a series of rooms
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>for outdoor living. One look at Dumbar
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ton Oaks’ plan reveals at a glance the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>variety of sizes and shapes of its outdoor
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>“rooms.&quot; Different materials define each
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>space: stone, brick, box hedges, etc., and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in each the planting scheme is varied to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>create a different mood.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>There is an order to the kind of spaces
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>or outdoor rooms. Close to the house, the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>spaces are formal; gradually they move to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>greater and greater informality as distance
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>from the house increases, until at the edges
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the planting almost blends into the natural
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>park which surrounds the garden.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>No one path takes the garden-walker
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>around the whole garden. Rather, there
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>are a multiplicity of paths which go to a
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>multiplicity of gardens. From a few places
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>in the garden one gets a glimpse of a large
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>vista, but as an idea the garden is more a
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>series of magical spaces.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Farrand received the commission for
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the Dumbarton Oaks garden in 1923
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>when she was 51 and already had a long
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>list of gardens to her credit.11 The com
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>mission for this 54-acre garden, of which
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>only 16 acres remain, came from Robert
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>W. Bliss, U.S. Ambassador to Sweden,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_12_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and his wife Mildred. (They returned in

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The real client, however, was not Am

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>would send her own drawings of facades
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and plans to the architect.12 During the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>course of the project, she and Farrand
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were to become close friends.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>For the Dumbarton Oaks job, the

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The garden was not to be designed after
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the buildings. On the contrary, White had
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>to get Farrand’s approval on the siting and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>design of each new part. She had a say in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the placing of the major addition—the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>music room (which later became famous

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Farrand noted:

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>balconies over the east bay roof which
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>will look even more dreadfully when the

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>(which is saying a good deall). If you
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>agree to taking off the balconies will you
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>write and tell Davis he may do so, and tell
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>him to keep them carefully in case they
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>are again needed. We can keep them intact
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>so that if their absence is lamented we can
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>glue them on again.21
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Little was said, however, in the letters
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of exactly what Farrand was striving for
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in her design, except for one theme which
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>can be threaded through her few written
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>statements:
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Perhaps also you will help me with the

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>anxious to keep this part of the design,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and yet it must look as if it belonged
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>there.22
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Farrand intended her gardens to be used,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and she was constantly aware of how
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>people would move through and enjoy
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the garden. Dumbarton Oaks was planted
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>for fall, winter, and spring, but not for
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>summer, when its owners would be away.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The enjoyment and comfort of the user
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>were considered as important as form and

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>45 and 50 feet, there will be a clearer

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>steps...the steps everywhere have been

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>den visit. It was also established as a gen
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>eral principle that where possible no flights
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of more than six steps should be built
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>without a landing between the first and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the next run of another six or eight steps.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>These landings have been made longer
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>than three feet where possible in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>give rest to the climber.23

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>there is a statement of design intentions:
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>This courtyard is hardly a garden but
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>should be thought of more as an unroofed
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>room adjoining the music room and the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>museum so that its scale is really an in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>terior and not an outdoor scale and the

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>stantly in mind.2
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_6_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>If one tried to find one overall concept

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>it would be the garden as a sequence of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>spaces rather than just a large vista.25 This
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>idea is central to the design of Dumbarton
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Oaks, as is the idea of the decreasing for
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>mality of spaces as they move away from
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the house. Both ideas owe much to the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>work of Edith Wharton. In preparation
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>for her book on Italian villas, Wharton

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>use. She, too, made a garden by creating a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>series of distinct spaces. She gave these
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>spaces different characters through the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>use of texture and color, often confined to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>a limited range in a contained space. Ex
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>amples are her purple-grey garden at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Hestercombe and the all-white garden at

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>trees, grass, and ivy ground cover to serve
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>as background to the colors of dresses at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the outdoor entertainments held there in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>spring and summer. The clearly contained

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>beams in aerial-hedge formation. Finally,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as the garden reaches its edge and seeps,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>nearly, into nature, both Jekyll and Far
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>rand stand as major artists. Jekyll&apos;s pond

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>are made to look like nature itself. Only

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>...a garden is an absolutely artificial

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>artificial: a real garden is just as artificial
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>as a painting.28
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>A tentative assessment of Farrand&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>work sets it apart from her contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>practitioners, who were building gardens
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in styles.&quot; She referred to precedents, but
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>did not copy them. She opposed many of

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Her greatest achievement was in making

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>belonged there.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Records show that on the Bliss job

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>There were copies of the most active jobs
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>at both offices.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>By following the addresses in the cor
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>respondence for those ten years, we can
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>make out that Farrand spent the months
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>from May to November working in her
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Maine office and the rest of the year in her
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>New York office. But she did not work
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>only in the office: most letters refer to a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>forthcoming visit or a return from a job
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>site. Since all these travels were by train,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>her activity was quite remarkable.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>A list of home addresses throws some
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>light on the way Farrand coordinated her
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>work with her personal life, which she al
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ways kept very private. New York City
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>appears as a home address in 1913. At the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>end of 1913, at age 42, she married Yale
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>historian Max Farrand. Her home address
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>is then listed as New Haven, with her New
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>York address as the office. In 1924 she
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>added the Maine office. In 1926 she added
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>a home in New York at 77 Park Avenue.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>By 1927, and until 1942, Max Farrand was
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Director of the Huntington Library in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Pasadena, California. Beatrix Farrand
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>was offered a curatorship there, but she
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>declined it. We then see her traveling for
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>one month every year to California, from
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>late December to late January. Max Far

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>and sometimes longer. By 1932, toward

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_11_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>still had her two offices, but she listed her

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Beatrix Farrand certainly achieved
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>great success in her profession. She ac
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>complished a large body of excellent work
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and was an innovator in her subtle trans

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>foreign models flooded American design.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>She ran her jobs in the format of a modern
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>American office at a time in which this
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>specialized office format was just emerg
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ing. Her clients and collaborators were
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>important socially and professionally.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>She had made herself officially prominent
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>in the profession by helping to found the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>American Society of Landscape Archi
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tects. Why, then, has she been forgotten,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>unlike her two professional role models,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Wharton and Jekyll?
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>A comparison to Jekyll, who is well
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>remembered as a landscape architect, is
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>instructive. Jekyll was prolific in writing
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>about her work, writing book after book
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>on gardening, as well as articles in jour
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>nals important in the field. Farrand wrote
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>only a few articles very early in her career.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>The notes which survive from Dumbarton
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Oaks gardens are just working notes,

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>sphere unless it is forced out into the pub
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>lic domain, usually by the method of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>printing. I do not think it is accidental
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that literature is one of the few areas
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>where there have been important women
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>artists. The printed word insures that the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>work becomes public. Painting on a can

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>formed their own clubs, which focused on

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>clubs. In the 1890s Black women’s clubs
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>began to focus on the issue of defense of

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>far exceeded its availability. The practical
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>minded clubwomen had two rules for its
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>use: the club always had first claim on
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>any space at any time, and no alcohol
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>could be served—they were quick to add
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that the clubwomen themselves were not
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>teetotallers, but that they were taking

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Another professed motivation for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>building a clubhouse was the desire to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>entertain other women’s clubs. The en

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>her city. Then, as each Glide daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>married and settled in Berkeley, each had
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a Morgan house in a different style, one

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>belongs to the university. Julia Morgan
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>also built huge hay barns at Clarksburg,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>near Sacramento, for the Glide family.

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>usual is that it is unlikely that any male
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>would have a roster of clients that was 50

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>commissioning domestic buildings. This is

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Morgan as it is about women themselves.

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>other women that led them to patronize a

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>available. It was in large part because of

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>There are many reasons for this. She
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>shunned publicity, her work was designed
