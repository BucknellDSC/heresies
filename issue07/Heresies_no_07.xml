				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Heresies is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly called art can have a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>political impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our identi
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ties as women play a distinct role. We hope that Heresies will stimulate dialogue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the history of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to the broadening of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Heresies is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also socialists,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; our fields include painting, sculpture,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture and film
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>making. While the themes of the individual issues will be determined by the collec-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tive, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of women who want to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>work on that issue as well as members of the collective. Proposals for issues may be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>conceived and presented to the Heresies Collective by groups of women not associ
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ated with the collective. Each issue will take a different visual form, chosen by the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>group responsible. Heresies will try to be accountable to and in touch with the inter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>national feminist community. An open evaluation meeting will be held after the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>appearance of each issue. Topics for issues will be announced well in advance in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>order to collect material from many sources. It is possible that satellite pamphlets
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and broadsides will be produced continuing the discussion of each central theme. In
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>addition Heresies provides training for people who work editorially, in design and in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>production, both on-the-job and through workshops. As part of its commitment to the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>public, Heresies houses and maintains the Women Artists’ Slide Registry.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections are clarified they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to understand the relationshop between art and politics, work and workers. As a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>step toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to art within the present system, which has often become the relationship of adver-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tiser to product. We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>they are made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>nor to the competitive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of this dialogue we can
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>foster a change in the meaning of art.

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We have been working together
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>for about a year. We share a sense
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of confusion, disappointment and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>frustration as we look back. For a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>while, the causes of our malaise
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>were obscure to us. Although we
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>had our share of angry exchanges,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>we did not suffer from evident polit

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I have really enjoyed the people
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>working on the issue. Getting to

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>In general, the women in our group
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>are clear about themselves and their
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>lives and have shown themselves to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>be pretty open and direct in dealing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>with each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>We established a “friendly-but

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>which we would only later call a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>conspiracy of niceness. Months
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>later, we remain friendly, more often

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Yet something went wrong.

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>It seemed that we so often looked for

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>to be a cohesive group for the others.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Not surprisingly, in such an at

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>writers. From the outset, we found it
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>difficult to focus our issue’s topic.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>We agreed that we were interested
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>in the experiences women had had

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>work structures. We did not want

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>or on conflicts between professional

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>for talking about women working to

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>In retrospect, we realize that

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Because of the lack of passion and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>goals, we were not sufficiently mo-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tivated to explore and modify the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>increasingly unsatisfying.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>These problems were compounded
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>by the particular history of our issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>This issue originally was intended
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>as a project of the main Heresies Col

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and history, along with “true confes

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and collectives. When Heresies
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>realized they could not follow
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>through with their project, they
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>opened up the issue to the feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>community. Coming to this decision
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>took time and meant, paradoxically,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that the issue was “late” before our
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>editorial group had ever met. We
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>were confronted with a practical

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>At first we were a shifting group

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>It was their task to clarify the proj-

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>allegiances, most of us occasionally
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>felt harassed and misunderstood by
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a collective whose operations were
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>confusing, even unintelligible to us.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>It was easy to feel antagonistic
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>toward the very group for whom we
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were working and who made our ex

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with the larger collective over the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>size of the issue, its budget, and our
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>time schedule. These problems be
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>came more explicit as our project
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>wore on. We sometimes felt that the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>lay in “their” hands. This tended to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>reinforce the sense of an adversarial
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>relation.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>In our final months we have devel

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tween writers and artists, which we
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tend to justify as a split between
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>editorial and design. This division
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>has compounded the disconnected

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>The schism between the artists and

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>as merely decorative.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>We decided collectively about the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>value of written material. We were

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>words to ask about the politics or
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>meaning of the visuals. I feel cut off
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>from a large part of the magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>My level of ambivalence about the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>At times it has seemed as if we

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We came together recently to reflect
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>upon our individual and collective
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>experiences. Now, at last, we are
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>engaging in the kind of nonjudgment
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>al self-criticism necessary to group
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>projects. We have worked hard,

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>about our experience.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Although we are not happy with

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>do like what we have produced. We
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>see this issue as a groundbreaking

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>have many options: more and more
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>women are exploring them and feel
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ing good about the results. It is good
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to work together, but it isn’t easy.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>We must learn to make compromises
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and relinquish control, at the same

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>performer in life. Her cancer was
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>attacked by surgeons, her woman&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>existence was challenged by men
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and children, and her short life was
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>crowded with broken washing
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>machines, miserable relatives and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>late alimony checks. It is not Mimi&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>courage that impresses me, but that
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>she died intact: Mimi.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I try not to lose her. My own life is

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>something this year.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>A fewyears ago, I had a part-time
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>job as an administrator at a Prov
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>incetown art center. I worked with
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Martha there. A few years earlier
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>we had both been fellowship artists
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>at the center; now we were bosses. I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was head of a staff much older than
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I with whom I respectfully dis-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>agreed. I wanted to change the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hierarchical structure of the art
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>center, imagining I could dissolve
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the whole art world by so doing. I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>did bring about some changes, but
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the structure of the center did not
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>change. My attempts went unno
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ticed for the most part—and I want
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ed credit. Martha was the only per
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>son to whom I explained my actions
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and with whom I shared my view of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the center. We were confidantes,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>feeling we had to keep ourselves un
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>der cover if we were ever to effect
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>change.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>We were actresses, like Mimi,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>playing grownups at our first real
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>job. We felt we must behave dif
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ferently in our responsible positions.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I felt that we should act as if we had
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>power and status when we were
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>with those in our debt, and be hum

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>played. When, after two years, we
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>quit the center jobs, it was to return
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>to our studios to paint.

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>By October, my
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>studio depresses me.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>It is cold. I look at the cement
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>floor and drafty garage door and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>know it will only get colder. I long to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>work in the house, but it is small and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>my family prefers cooking aromas to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>paint fumes. The temptation to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>vacuum away cat hairs is there. I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>am impatient with the new work I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>have begun. Figurative work turns
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>abstract, idiosyncratic and stiff. Old
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>work looks as schizophrenic as my
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>life. I am stuck between paintings
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that do not follow smoothly from one
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to the next.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>At first Martha and I talk about
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>working together again, to generate
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>some income. “Two heads are better
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>than one. Martha needs to supple
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ment her unemployment checks and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I need money for art supplies and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>studio heat. We talk about becoming
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>window dressers. We joke that we
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>are experienced in dressing our
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>selves, our apartments, so why not?
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>We have both made paintings of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>windows, in periods where we look
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>from the inside out. Now we want to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>look from the outside in.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>We are regulars at a nearby thrift
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>shop and ask if we can experiment
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>with their windows. We make a Hal-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>loween window, costumes from cos-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>tumes. Next we ask a grocer to lend
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>her window to the experiment. There
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>we spend a week making a three-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dimensional kitchen from cardboard
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>boxes. It looks like a page from a
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>child’s giant pop-up book, a kitchen
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>for all to see, big and bright. But no
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>one does see it. Perhaps because the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>store has never used its window this
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>way before, it is out of the line of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>focus. One more try and for the first
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>time we are paid, ten dollars each.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>This time it is a shoe store. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>it is December, the weather is warm
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>enough for a group of young men to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>gather on the benches across the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>street. They watch us. I am clumsy,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tiptoeing between shoes, always
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>conscious of the glass. My jeans are
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>too tight, but I can find no way to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>arrange shoes without bending over.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I used to love shoes. Even when
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>we were broke I always figured out
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a way to buy a new pair of shoes,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>but last summer I was perfectly com
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>fortable in the pair that came in a
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>box of kid’s hand-me-downs. After
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>fifteen minutes it turns out the only
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>shoes we want to put in that window
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>are cheap colored plastic ones, and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>those are the only ones the owners
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>want to keep out. Eventually, the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>window is so crowded with clumsy
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>boots, furry bedroom slippers and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>men’s jogging shoes that it looks
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>worse than it did before we started.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>As soon as the owners go out to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>lunch, we throw in a bag of confetti
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to cover everything. After that day,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>we do not talk about window dress-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ing any more, but we feel respon
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>sible to follow through somehow. We
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>put ads in local papers. “Naked win
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>dows? Have them dressed for Christ
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>mas.” The response is obscene
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>phone calls.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Admittedly most windows on Cape

			<pb n='10'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>so our choice of employment reflects
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>our disinterest in paid work. Never
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>theless windows, or the absence of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>windows, become a source of in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>spiration. We are both stuck, looking
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for something to do that will take us
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>beyond our studios, ourselves. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>as if we are window shopping, but
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>there are no windows. So we decide
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to examine mail order catalogs
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>instead.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>When Martha finds the right look
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>in one of them, she brags that she
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>can copy it at a thrift shop. I seldom
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>get that far into the process. Imag

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>thought of money makes me anxious.

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the reality of making a family—or

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Martha is able to take my ideas

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>we are doing. Slowly we begin to

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and the responsibility for doing so
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>makes us uneasy, silly. We invent an

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>he be talking to if not to Cahoots? At

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>speak to now, and space enough for
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>three to stand in surrounds us. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>like being newlyweds, but even then
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>someone comes to talk to the man.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>We applied to the Massachusetts

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>then we realized she had a name.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>There are grants for individual
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>artists but none for partners, like us.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>We know of husband-wife teams
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>where she does at least half the

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>billing maybe. We think of a mar
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>quee and wonder which of our
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>names would go first. We had made
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>one product together. Neither of us
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>could have done it alone.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>When we discovered that we were
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>making something we believed in,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>we created a third person to take
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>responsibility. Harmony Cahoots is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>our silent partner. She is our cover.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>She provided support when we had
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>no other. But by creating strength in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Harmony, we made our weaknesses
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>evident. Like my lost friend Mimi, we
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>are actresses, but unlike Mimi, I am
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>uncomfortable acting. To fill in when
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>experience or character is absent, I
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>pretend. When I feel that there is no

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>self, I pretend. It is a matter of look

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>express a need for hiding, for being

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that. I don’t know of any examples of

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>think they would have.

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>shares for S10. They turned the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>process into an educational one,

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>meant. They contacted people

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>hoping that once a few people bought
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>shares, others would follow. Here
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>was an opportunity for people who
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>had never owned a share of any

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The risk paid off. At first only
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>friends and family bought shares.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Thirty-two people have bought
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>2,416 of the 3,000 shares. Not every

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>they make back into the store. They
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>can do this because Carol and Bev
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>erly continue to work in their city

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>store. They now realize it will take

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>simply by being there. “I see us as
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>an inspiration,” says Leslie. “Just
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the other day someone came in and

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>here. I like that idea—an oasis. It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>really amazing, you know. People

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>all. Even if some day we have to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>close up, it&apos;Il have been worth it.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>They have divided up the work in

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>publicity. They saw no reason to in-

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>had. “Well, you know, when you talk

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>you want them to mean. You set up

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>to be in a corporation together. But
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>there are certain rules, and that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>just part of life,” they say.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>their success. Carol explains: “We
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>all met after we was grown. We all
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>had ideas about what we wanted out

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>supposed to be my friend.”” Beverly
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>talks about their working process:
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“We’re not going to agree all the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>time, but for one to feel as if they&apos;re
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>better than the other, it just would
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>never work. We all have the same

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing as one, really.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Beverly, Leslie and Carol agree
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that the most difficult problems have
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>involved the adjustments that each

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ule and family life. Since Beverly
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and Carol have income-producing
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>jobs during the day, they work at the

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Leslie and Peaches share their store
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hours to suit their children’s school
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>schedules. This schedule leaves little
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>time for their families. Beverly, who
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>has a two-year-old son and two older
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>children, worries about the long
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>term effects. More often than not, at
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>least one child is at the store to spend
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>time with her/his mother. “It&apos;s im

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>I waited and waited. no call came. I cant say, the call didnt come be
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cause it wasn’t a question of one really. it was a question of any one. it was

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N028'/>so I wait. not quietly, I might add. I sigh and grunt and groan. I make

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her. or try to. she would push the cat aside with one hand, pretending

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for example, one morning I go to cover a story. I go 1500 miles to cover

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>so I go to cover the story and the ass wigglers are out in large numbers. I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>mean they are fucking hanging from the chandeliers, and there are chan

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>so its a conference of women, and the point is that this particular event
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>occurred because a lot of tough shining new women have demanded this

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N006'/>so the line is drawn. but its been drawn before. in fact its been drawn right

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>come out, it just stayed inside and festered and grew. she was pregnant

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>remember it. she sold it for a corned beef sandwich and for steak when she

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>did it in ones twos threes and fours with onlookers and without. so she

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>would rather be dead if only the dying wasnt so fucking slow and awful and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>she didnt love life goddam it so much. the truth is once you stop yoù stop. its
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>not something you can go back to once its broken you in half and you know
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>what it means. I mean, as long as youre alive and you know what trading in
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ass means and you stop, thats it. its not negotiable, and the woman for
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>whom it is not negotiable is anathema.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for example, heres a typical vignette. not overdrawn, underdrawn.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>youre done yr days work, fucking. youre home. so some asshole man thinks
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>thats his time. so he comes with a knife and since hes neighborhood trade
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>you try to calm him down. most whores are pacifists of the first order. so he
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>takes over yr room, takes off his shirt, lays down his knife. thats yr triumph.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the fuck isnt anything once the knife is laid down. only the fuck is always
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>something. you have to pretend that you won. then you got to get him to go
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>but hes all comfy isnt he. so another man comes to the door and you say in
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>an undertone, this fuckers taken over my house, so it turns out man 2 is a
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>hero, he comes in and says what you doing with my woman. and it turns out
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>man 2 is a big drug dealer and man 1 is a fucking junkie. so you listen to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>man 1 apologize to man 2 for fucking his woman. so man 1 leaves. guess
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>who doesnt leave? right. man 2 is there to stay. so he figures hes got you
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and he does. and he fucking tries to bite you to death and you lie still and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>groan because you owe him and he fucking bites you near to death. between
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>yr legs, yr clitoris, he fucking bites and bites. then he wants breakfast. so
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>once you been through it enough, enough is enough.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ah, you say, so this explains it, whores hate men because whores see the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>worst, what would a whore be doing with the best. but the truth is that a
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>whore does the worst with the best. the best undress and reduce to worse
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>than the rest. besides, all women are whores and thats a fact. at least all
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>women with more than $11.14 in the bank. me too. shit, I should tell you
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>what I did to get the $11.14. nothing wrong with being a whore. nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>wrong with working in a sweatshop. nothing wrong with picking cotton.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>nothing wrong with nothing.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I like the books these jerko boys write. I mean, and get paid for. its
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>interesting. capital, labor, exploitation, tomes, volumes, journals, essays,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>analyses. all they fucking have to do is stop trading in female ass. appar
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ently its easier to write books. it gives someone like me a choice. laugh to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>death or starve to death. Ive always been pro choice. the ladies are very
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>impressed with those books. its a question of physical coordination. some
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>people can read and wiggle ass simultaneously. ambidextrous.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>so now Im waiting and thinking. Anne Frank and Sylvia Plath leap to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>mind. they both knew Nazis when they saw them, at some point. there were
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>a lot of ass wigglers in the general population around them wiggling ass
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>while ovens filled and emptied. wiggling ass while heroes goosestepped or
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>wrote poetry. wiggling ass while women, those old fashioned women who
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>did nothing but hope or despair, died. this new woman is dying too, of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>poverty and a broken heart. the heart broken like fine china in an earth
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>quake, the earth rocking and shaking under the impact of all that goddam
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ass wiggling going off like a million time bombs. an army of whores cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>fail—to die one by one so that no one has to notice. meanwhile one sad old
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>whore who stopped liking it has a heart first cracked then broken by the

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the same primal force. Physicists all over the world were discovering waves. A female magician brought

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>She stepped into one of the lockers. It was riveted shut. No drape was set up in front of it. It was pried
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>open. It was empty. A collective gasp went up from the audience. She was seen running into the theater
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>from the lobby. She leaped onstage. Her eyes seemed to gleam the color of blue diamonds. Slowly she

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>into the human brain. Their work was suffering from bad reviews. An artist rented a studio in Brooklyn
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and went to work there. She took to sitting on a wooden chair in the middle of the room. One day she decided
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>her chair was facing in the wrong direction. Raising her weight from the chair she lifted it with her two
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>hands and turned it to the right to align it properly. For a moment she thought the chair was aligned, but
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>then she decided it was not.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>She moved it another turn to

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>peculiar. She turned it again.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Eventually she made a com

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>for the chair. The light faded

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>not want it. Office workers in an

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>defensive because students and
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>faculty see them as generally stupid
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and unresourceful. But they are cer

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>In our particular office, the work
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was tedious, impersonal and dread

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>numbers and various categorizing

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>When we did talk, our conversations
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>rarely had anything to do with our
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tasks. If one of the supervisors ob

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>correctly assume that we were not
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>talking about work. Periodically, the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>supervisors attempted to rearrange
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the office, moving us away from each
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>other, putting file cabinets between
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>us, turning our desks to face the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>walls. Despite these obstacles, we
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>managed to connect the way women
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>have always connected. We talked,

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>hard-edged nickname. I wondered at
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>first why she was identified by this
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>particular color, what characteris
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tic it described. She didn’t have red

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was certain of her superiority to

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>when the office was busy. She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>showed irritation whenever one of

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>for her limited power. We all knew

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>title and a significant raise. Several

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>She had just one problem. Nobody

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of power and powerlessness. She
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was Mr. Dickson’s personal secre
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tary. She kept his schedule of meet
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ings, of dinners and luncheons; she
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>screened his phone calls, kept his
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>office tidy and reported any unrest
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in the office. She was the only em
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ployee who didn’t call him “Dildo”-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the word embarrassed her. The
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>women in the office disliked her,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>despite her pleasant and helpful
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>manner. Luane made fun of her,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Jean ignored her and Red endured
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>her. The rest of us quietly resented
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her without knowing why. Her salary
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was modest, her position was unim-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>portant, she had no prestige or
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>power of her own. Outside the of-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>fice, she had a loving husband and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>two teenaged sons. She was too will-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing to settle for her position. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>even grateful for such a good job.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>She was content and unquestioning.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>To the rest of the office, she was an
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>unforgivable fool.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Luane was the most attractive
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>woman in the office. She was 26—
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>divorced, thin, with beautiful red
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>hair which she washed and curled
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>every morning. She and Martha
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>were the only ones who wore dresses
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to work but, unlike Martha’s, hers
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>were sexy, strikingly out of place in
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the office. Luane had two children,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>both of them hyperactive and, she
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>admitted, out of her control. She
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>took them to a sitter each morning
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>before work. She spoke bitterly of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>her ex-husband, who took no respon-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>sibility for their children.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Luane was tough, brittle, smart
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and very funny. She had a coarse
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sense of humor; if she didn’t like
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>somebody she would deride them
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with obscene banter. She had a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>natural flair for understanding com
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>puters and had learned computer
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>language informally, without train
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ing. Luane never played up to her
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>supervisors. She was as tough and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>flippant with them as she was with
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>everyone else. She despised Martha
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and Jean because they “sucked ass&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>in a way that she would not, and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>she ridiculed Suzy for being naïve.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Luane, with her uncompromising at
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>titude, had perhaps the most integ
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>rity of any one in the office. She
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bristled with resentment, from her
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>beautiful tense face to her nervous,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_10_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>manicured, nicotine-stained finger

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Margaret was a college graduate,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>like Jean, but she had majored in
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>English and had drifted through her
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>undergraduate years, assuming that
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>something nice would be waiting for
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>her after all the classes and papers
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and tutorials. Had anyone told her
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that she would become a secretary
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>after graduation she would have
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>scoffed.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The nine-to-five world was a great
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>shock to Margaret’s delicate system.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>It shattered all her fantasies about
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>work, independence and fulfillment.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The promise held by her education
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>began to fade into the background of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>working. Work, she suspected, is
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>largely exhausting and futile.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>At first, the rest of the staff dis
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>trusted Margaret as an alien, an
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>academic. They watched carefully,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>waiting for her to exhibit the signs of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>elitism—aloofness, snobbishness,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>refusal to dress properly or wear
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>makeup. Her unmarried state was
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>an added source of confusion to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>everyone. As far as they could tell,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>there was nothing seriously wrong
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>with her, no reason for her not to be
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_13_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>married. Although the institution of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>marriage was often derided by the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>women, it was still assumed that
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>everybody is engaged, married or
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>divorced, or is in transition to be
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>coming one or the other.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Margaret was saved from bore
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>dom with the work by a need to “fit
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in, to be accepted and liked by the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>others. Part of her need stemmed
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>from predictable middle-class guilt.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>After all, she knew she wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>always be a secretary. But she began
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to realize that many of her idealistic
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_16_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>notions about “liberation” were
			</p>
			<pb n='34'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>simply rhetoric to these women. She
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>found herself trying to please them,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to be efficient, to dress carefully, to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>talk about clothes and hair, food and
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>babies and television. It was like
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>learning a new language, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>came quickly; her need to know was
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>genuine. The work itself was repug
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>nant, boring and draining. She
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>watched the women as they worked
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>around her, listening to them, looking
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>for explanations and revelations. She
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>found herself shrinking and growing
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>at the same time. How can we make
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sense of this place? she would ask
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>herself. And what does it mean to be
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>stuck here together every day? Is it
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>all right to be inside and outside at
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>once, always interpreting, always
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>speaking guardedly, hiding so much,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>wanting to explain, to help, to reveal,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to connect?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Ruth was the stabilizing influence
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in the office. She was hard-working
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>but cynical and humorously dis
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>respectful of authority. She was not
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>as funny as Luane, but her humor
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was suggestive in a shy way that
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>made us all giggle.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Ruth was a 35-year-old woman
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>who looked 50. She wore three out-
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>fits to the office, one after the other,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>each of them dark-colored and
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>shapeless. There was a warm quality
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>about her that made everyone like
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her. She had a beautiful lilting voice,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>with a faint Scottish accent (she was
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>originally from Scotland).
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Ruth’s job was one of the most
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>meaningless jobs in the office. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>repetitive, enlivened only by pressing
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>deadlines and urgent demands from
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>other departments. Somehow, Ruth
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>managed to do the job and stay
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>pleasant and unruffled. She never
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>took her duties too seriously, some-
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>how remaining detached from the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>pressures of the job. She did her
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>work well, but never let the job ride
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her. In this, she was an example to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the rest of the office. When she was
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sometimes criticized by her super
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>visors for not being more committed,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>for being slipshod in her attitude,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>she listened but paid little attention
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to them.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Ruth considered divorcing her
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>husband throughout the year she
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>worked in the office. He was slender,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>handsome—and unfaithful. They
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>stayed married because of their four
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>beautiful, tow-headed daughters.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Ruth often asked me to explain the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>more fundamental beliefs of the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>women’s movement. She often coun
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>seled me not to marry or have chil
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>dren, despite the fact that she clear
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ly loved her daughters. Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>when I carefully explained the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>changes in sex roles advocated by
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the women’s movement, Ruth looked
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>pleased, as these principles con
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>firmed her husband’s guilt. But other
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>times she snorted and protested,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>saying that those crazy women were
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>asking for the moon, and she

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>After Ruth had worked with us for
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>a year, she decided to divorce her
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>husband and to move back to Scot
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>land with her three oldest daugh
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ters. She left her youngest, the baby,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>with her husband and his mistress.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Almost everyone was horrified
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Martha even stopped speaking to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>her. But Luane said simply, “You

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Ruth left the country a few weeks

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>When anyone leaves the office,

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>school, was hired to replace her.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Suzy was a pretty, scared 19-year-
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>old when she joined the staff. She
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>constantly apologized for her inex

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>proach got her off to a bad start;
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>everyone became impatient with her.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>She was overwhelmed by Ruth’s job,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and after two weeks it was clear
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the job would always be too much
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for her. Her errors created prob
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>lems for the others, as many respon
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sibilities overlapped from job to job;
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>her incompetence was unforgivable
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>because other people in the office
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>had to cover up for her. Suzy knew
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>she was botching it, and as her ner
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>vousness increased, she became
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>more timid and apologetic. She be

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>seemed to be in a daze, waiting for
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>someone to tell her what to do next.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>The women in the office teased
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>Suzy because she was newly mar-

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>sarcastic remarks about how nice it
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_12_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>must be to have a husband, but at

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the same time indicated that mar
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>riage was for the ignorant and stupid.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The teasing confused Suzy, who
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>thought her handsome husband Nick
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was a prize. She continued to talk
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>about him, shyly yet insistently, as if
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she were determined to be congratu
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>lated. “He looks like a drip, said
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Sharon loudly once when Nick came
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>by the office to say hello to Suzy.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Four months after she was hired,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Suzy was rescued from her plight by
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Nick’s graduation. They returned to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Nick’s hometown, where he had a
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>job as a pharmacist. Suzy spent her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>last week in the office staring off
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>into space, giggling to herself.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Sharon was probably harder to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>get to know than anyone else in the
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>office. She had a cold, set face,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>heavily madeup eyes and stiffly
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sprayed hair. Her voice was low-
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pitched, she had a slight Southern
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>accent, and she spoke curtly, in short
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sentences. It was Sharon who first
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>called Mr. Dickson “Dildo. She
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>looked like a country Western star,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with her thin, curvy body always
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>dressed in tight clothes. Her ap
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>pearance made smug little coeds
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>laugh, in their gauzy shirts and big
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sweaters and straight hair. But after
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a few weeks of working with her, I
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>realized Sharon thought she was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>something else — really beautiful.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>She had a string of boyfriends
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>who were all crazy about her. She
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was divorced, with a small daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>who was left with Sharon’s mother
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>much of the time. Apparently Sharon
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>drank like a fish on her frequent
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dates, but she rarely missed a day of
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>work, even if she was badly hung
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>over. Once I asked her which of her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>many boyfriends she liked best and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>why. She said: “Oh, Mike, he can
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>keep it up all night.” Luane laughed,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>but Sharon wasn’t trying to be fun
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ny, she was really telling me the best
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>she could expect from her boyfriends.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>She lied to them all, toying with them
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and making them jealous. She often
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>bragged about her lying, as if she
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>had some kind of fundamental per
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mission to do this to men for the hell
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Sharon was a typist. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tough and competent in the office,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>fast and accurate no matter what
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>condition she was in. She would set
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her face, purse her mouth and pound
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the typewriter, and nobody with any
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>brains dared interrupt her. Nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>but Luane, who occasionally threw
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>paper clips or paper wads just to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>hear her swear, which she did with
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>a snarling laugh. She and Luane
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were friends, although they were
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>very different, and they sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>went out together to singles bars in
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the city.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Verna was a shy, soft-spoken
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>woman with frizzy blond hair and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>eggshell-pale skin. She always
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>seemed overwhelmed by the push
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and pull of the other office personali
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ties and kept to herself. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>married to a postal worker and the
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>mother of three children. The young
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>est of her children seemed always to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>be sick. A cold, a virus, an infection
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the flu, you name it, Billy had it. So
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she was often late and had to make
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>up hours. Although the supervisors,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>especially Red, bitched about her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>absences, they never said anything
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>directly to her. I think they knew
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that if they did, Verna, with her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pale, tired eyes and her quiet, de
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>pendable nature, would quit on the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>spot. She was the only woman in the
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>office who clearly would have pre
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ferred to stay home. There seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to be a silent, ever-present strain in
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her life. She rarely mentioned her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>husband, except to cluck-cluck her
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tongue and shake her head when
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ever his name came up.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Everyone in the office liked Verna.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>There was something in her weari
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ness and frustration that we all
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>understood. Sharon always spoke to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Verna, asking her about Billy; Shar
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>on never asked anyone about their
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>children. There was a constant at
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tempt to protect Verna, and to make
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>her life easier. It was something that
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>we never really spoke about.

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The office opens at 8:30. Red and

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The staff begins to trickle in from
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>8:15 to 8:45. Sharon is always early,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Jean is always on the dot. Sharon
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>spends the extra 15 minutes “mak

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>lights. She comes out to her desk
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>looking stiff, colorful and singularly
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>awake. The rest of us trickle in un
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>predictably, early, on time, late.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Punctuality is an issue. Everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>watches to see who will be late. It’s
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>often Luane, as it is today, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>comes in looking tense, complaining
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>about her babysitter. Verna, who is
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_12_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>always late, comes in quietly, in

			<pb n='36'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>coat. Everyone greets her; she seems
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to signal the workday’s beginning.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>It is Margaret’s turn to make cof

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>days depress her; she feels the
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>weight of the week ahead. Everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>talks about the weekend, how much

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>was accomplished, where they took
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>their kids. Margaret feels guilty that

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>visiting friends. She says nothing.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The coffee is too strong. Everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>teases Margaret about it, and Ruth
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>says it’s no wonder she’s not mar

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>greetings, silently communicating
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that it is time to get to work. Type-

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that Red asks Jean to tell everyone to

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>This remark is so stupid that for a

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>class on the book, a woman raised
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>her hand and hesitantly asked, “Um,

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>lesbian?” “Yes,” I answered laugh

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>such encounters, I have begun to un
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>derstand those feelings of fear and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>insecurity which I experienced in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>first teaching a lesbian work. The
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>students I teach have been raised in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a society that fears and hates homo
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sexuals. When my students did not
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>know I was a lesbian, and when the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>material we were dealing with made
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>homosexuality a topic of discussion
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>or reference, I was in an extremely
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>vulnerable position. In talking about

			<pb n='40'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>suming they were among a peer
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>heterosexual group—could easily
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>have said things that were threaten
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ing and hostile to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>What I feared then happened, in
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>fact, this year. A student wrote a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>poem about how unfortunate it is
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that the pansy, a delicate and com
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>plex flower, has been so maligned.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In discussing the poem, I assumed
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>she meant that the flower and male
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>homosexuals—those named for it—
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were maligned. “No, she said,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>isn’t it awful to name faggots and
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>queers after such a sweet flower?”1
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>went numb. I stared at her, momen
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tarily unable to speak. My impulse
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was to scream, to let her know that I
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>took this affront personally. I knew I
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>could silence her, if not change her
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>mind. But this was what I had feared
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>in that first class. I was personally
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>assaulted, and whatever I did to cor
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>rect her, I was still left shaken and
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>raw. “I will not allow those attitudes
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>or that language to be expressed in
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>this classroom, I told her. But I did
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>not say, “Iam one.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I do my best teaching when I can
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>assume that all of the students in my
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>class know I am a lesbian. Whatever

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>we are discussing, I encourage stu
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>dents to bring their own experiences
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to the literature and to relate lit
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>erature to their own lives. I need to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>be able to do the same, and my sexu
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>al preference is one important part
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of my identity and experience. When
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I introduced a course on the poetry
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>of Adrienne Rich, it seemed natural
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>in talking about her journey from
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>daughter-in-law to lesbian feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>for me to identify with that process.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Within my wider social commu-
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>nity, I gradually became identified
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>as a lesbian, a free spirit, as it were.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>I had hoped I would find a lover in
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>my new community. I had expected I
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>would. I did not expect—and did not
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>understand until much later—that I
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>was a hot sexual prospect: a new

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I also applied what I called Rule
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Number One: teachers do not be
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>come involved with students. At the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>time, it seemed a clear statement of
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>intention to me—one that would
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>make relationships with my lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>students open, above-board and
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>simple. I believed if I stated my un

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>us, that would be sufficient. From
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the very beginning of my contact
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with students in this new job, I made
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Rule Number One an open subject of
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>discussion.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Students seemed to think Rule
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Number One was funny. It usually
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>came up in those conversations
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>about male professors who had af
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>fairs with their female students. We
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>all had opinions about such things.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Mine was that power in such rela

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sumed therefore that the relation
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ship was exploitive; hence Rule

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Tension. And I did not realize that

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>most essential understanding of my
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>relationship to these students: that
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>an affair or the slightest implication
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of seduction would make me subject

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>scrutiny of a kind rarely experienced
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>by a heterosexual teacher.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>By the end of the first semester
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>had found a new lover, not in my

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women about her. When she moved
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in with me, I did not consider it a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>community project. My love life was
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>my own, I thought. A student confid
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ed to me later that when my lover
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>had appeared on the scene, her
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>friend had seemed shaken, come late
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to class, and scribbled in the margin
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of her notebook, “T’m going to com
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>mit suicide. J.M. has a new room

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>asked, puzzled. “She told us she was
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>having an affair with you, my stu

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Then I began to understand a con
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>frontation with that student which
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>had occurred midyear. We had been
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>working together on several proj-
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ects. I had thought her a friend, until
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>she walked into my office one day
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and announced that she couldn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>work with me any more. I was ex-

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>smiling. I looked at her, trying to de

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>fury and the efficacy of a low-key
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>response. Could she be more specif

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>No. She had nothing else to say. Her

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>year was one of belligerent con
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>frontation. The student had lost
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>track of reality. In lying about our
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>relationship within her own peer
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>community, she had taken an enor
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>mous risk—a risk I didn’t under
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>stand at first. But it was a response
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to tensions she must have felt in my
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>openly lesbian presence on campus.

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N028'/>Our lives were shaken up, sorted out
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N029'/>and put back together—all while
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N030'/>making feta cheese pies or peeling
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N031'/>garlic. Communication was a corner

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Despite all your talking, we did
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>manage to work thirty-five or forty
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>hours a week, and we worked well
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>together. The work assignments at
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Mother Courage were as remarkable
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>as our compatability. We not only
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>waitressed, but cooked, assisted the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>cook and eventually rotated in all
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>three capacities. Everyone had to do
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the jobs to work there and learned
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>/right away if she could handle it. 1
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>trained as cook’s assistant immedi
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ately. This job included prepping for
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the cook as well as washing dishes,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sometimes more dishes in a night
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>than I could use in a month. This
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was a hot, wet, back-breaking intro-
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>duction to the work at Mother Cour
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>age. The training for waitressing
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>coincided with that for cook’s as
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sistant. Cook’s training, however,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>was approached circumspectly—at
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>least by me. It was a fast-paced,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>high-pressure job requiring confi
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dence, organization, timing, concen
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tration and diligence. Training for
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>cook came when one felt ready for it,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and often months passed before
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>some of us did. Once learned, how
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ever, the job boosted one’s sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>accomplishment and was a welcome
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>change from dishwashing, a job with
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>only one benefit—it provided ample

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Job rotation was an evolutionary,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>if not revolutionary, work method.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Originally, Mother Courage was
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>structured like an ordinary restau
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rant: it had an owner, a cook, an
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>assistant cook, a dishwasher and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>waitresses, separate people locked
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>into separate functions. Although it
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>may have been unique in concept
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and intent, Mother Courage was not
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>unique in its work structure. The
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>first change combined the jobs (and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>salaries) of dishwasher and assistant
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>cook, so that one person could work
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a given amount of hours for twice
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the pay. Then a separate managerial
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>position was created and filled by
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>someone other than the owners. And
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>when the inequities between kitchen
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>work (ten hours for $40, taxes with
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>held) and waitressing (eight hours
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>for 835 to 880 in tips, nothing with
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>held) were unavoidable, the concept
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>of job rotation evolved, based on
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>economic and work-load equity.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>At Mother Courage the emphasis
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was as much on working together as

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>from economic and work-load equity.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>job rotation was a great equalizer of
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>pressures and responsibilities, and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tended to mute what little competi

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>rank, no one had rank to pull. When
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>one of us had spent ten hours on her
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>feet in the kitchen one night, either

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ressing the next night. And some
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>times working in the kitchen was a
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>welcome change from waitressing.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Some women were better at cer

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>where we paused under some shade

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of the patriarchal eye, got to know
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and care for one another. It was like

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a refuge for the customers as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>for ourselves. It was the center of a
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>social life, with play that often began
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>at work and went on into the night,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>nights off and holidays. Whether we

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>knew at the beginning that many of

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>could change that. I simply could not
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>do that kind of work any more. More
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>important, I was getting a clearer
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>picture of what I did want to do and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>how I would go about doing it, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>felt an urgent need to get on with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Working with women had been my

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>work anyway. But I learned that
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>there is just no way to mesh capital-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ism with feminist politics. You end
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>up somewhere between a hard place
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and a brick wall. If a woman who is
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>making §4.00 an hour deserves 85.00
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>an hour and the only place where
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that dollar can come from is my
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>salary, then there is a conflict.” The
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>options were: charge the customers
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>(other women) for it by raising
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>prices, take it from your own salary,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>or deny the worker the raise she
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>deserves. Not much room for maneu
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>verability. Any solution through
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>capitalism was only a partial solu-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tion and created a political problem
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in the process.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The successes and failures of
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Mother Courage could be argued for
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>hours. Some women thought it wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>radical enough, others believed you
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>brought your politics with you. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>thought it too noisy, others enjoyed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the clamor. Some thought it too small,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>others enjoyed the coziness. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>found the prices too high, others
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>found them more reasonable than
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>anywhere else in the area. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>thought it too out of the way, some
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>preferred its obscure location. And
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>on and on. If Mother Courage had a

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>other than the tried and true, a re

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Interviewing the aerialists was
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Jane’s idea. A painter who makes
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her paintings out of bugle beads, she
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>thought they would glitter too. Tough,

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>what she was looking for. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Abby didn’t know what to expect,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the aerialists were the final leg of

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>had just completed. I hadn’t thought

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>told as a child that circuses were
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>boring.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Jane had tracked the aerialists
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>from the Big Apple Circus to their
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>agent from whom she’d wrangled
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>their home phone numbers, and then
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>had faltered. As Abby’s friend and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Jane’s co-editorialist, I was corraled
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>into setting up the interview.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The Saturday of the interview, we

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Except for the hanging trapezes,

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>familiar territory, visually anyway.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>It looks like another artist’s loft in a

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>performers. Seated at the table, they

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>How did you decide to become
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>derialists?
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Donna. It was decided pretty much
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>for me. I had lived in Paris for three
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>years, and over there I was doing
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>some sculpture and dance—that
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was my schooling. Then, when I
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>came back to New York, I really
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>wanted to go into the dance world. I
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>checked out different schools, little
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>companies, and experimental the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>atres here. And I wasn’t happy with
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>anything. I just couldn’t find my real
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>place. Finally, I met up with the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mummenschanz people. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>doing acrobatics. I was trying cart
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>wheels and stuff. And they said,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Wow! Your body is good for acro
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>batics; you should go into it.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>When I wanted to find some acro
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>batic training, I was referred to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Nina and Gregory, our trainers.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>When they saw me, they asked me
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>right off, “Are you afraid of heights?
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Are you ready for hard work?
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>They

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>you’re made, and right away, the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>first day, boom! They have you
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>placed in a category because they
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>have an extensive background in cir
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>cus. They spent all their training,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>twenty years, in the Moscow State
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Circus. At first, Mia and I did some
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>work together on the ground with
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Mia supporting me. That was last
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>spring. We worked together only for
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>a few weeks. We didn’t know then
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>we would be together because Mia
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>had another woman partner.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>It was turning into summer. I had
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>worked with different partners, and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>I had fallen a few times. I already
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>had bad knees from dancing, so my
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>knee (suddenly) just went kaput. I
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>thought, Oh well, it’s all over. Good
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>bye to the circus and everything
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>else. Afterward, when I came back
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to visit the circus—I was walking
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>with a cane then—Nina saw me and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>said, “What’s the matter with you?”
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>I said, “My knee is bad.” And she
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>said, “What about the rest of your
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I said, “It’s fine.” Nina said,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>body?”
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Okay, come tomorrow morning to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>practice.” Ijust said, “Oh God.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The next morning I went to prac
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tice. Nina took me to this little
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>trapeze hanging under the band
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>stand in the tent, put my cane down,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and lifted me onto the trapeze. She
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>told me to do a few movements. Af
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>terward, she lowered me, gave me
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my cane back and said, “Okay, you
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>start training with us; we have a
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>new act for you.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>So that’s what I did. And then, one
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>day Mia came walking in...
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Mia. So now you have to know what
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>happened before I came walking in.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>For me, it all started three years be
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>fore. I knew Nina and Gregory so-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cially before I ever worked with
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>them.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>One day, Gregory called me up
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and said, “We will teach you, you
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and Elaine”(myother partner).AndI
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>said, “Oh yeah?” He said, “Yes. We
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>will teach you. Come. l’d never
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>done any circus acrobatics. I’d done
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>some mime, some clowning kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>acrobatics—falling, some hand
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>stands, handsprings, things like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>l’d tried to do some dance, but that
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>was a failure.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>So me and Elaine show up. They
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>stuck her on my shoulders and she
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>wobbled around, almost fell over.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>They started to train us to do an
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>adagio act for the Big Apple Circus
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>last year, but Elaine and Gregory
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>didn’t get along. The whole thing fell
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>apart. And then that’s when I met
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Donna.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Nina and Gregory wanted me to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>work with Donna, but I didn’t want
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>to drop Elaine. I tried to work with
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>both of them, and that didn’t work.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>You can’t have two, not when you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>working that hard. I didn’t speak to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Nina and Gregory for all of last sum
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>mer. I worked on the street with
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Elaine. We used to do hand-to-hand
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>work: she would do handstands,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>stand on my head and other things
			</p>
			<pb n='48'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>like that. We worked in parks,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>passed the hat, and we even got
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>good enough to work on the side-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>walk. Finally, that dissolved.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Then, for about three months, 1
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was going to give up the circus and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>be a painter. To hell with clowning,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>l’m going back to canvas. And I went
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>back to it. Then, all of a sudden, I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>really missed the circus. I knew Nina
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and Gregory were teaching at Car
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>mine Street, so I got up all my nerve.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>To face Gregory after you’ve not
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>spoken to him and had a big fight
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with him took a lot of nerve for me. I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>went back and I walked in, looked
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>around, saw Donna up on the tra
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>peze and people at work. I went up
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to Gregory and said, “I want to learn
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>trapeze. He said, “You will never
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>have solo act, you must have part
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ner. He looked at Donna and back
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to me and said, “Maybe Donna. So
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I went home and called Donna up
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>and said, “You want to work to-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>gether?” I didn’t tell Gregory. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>later Gregory called up and said, “I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>have an act for you, come in.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>And we started working together.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>It was about the beginning of Janu
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>ary. Next thing we knew, we were
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>up thirty feet in the air, performing.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>Did you always have a love for the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>circus?
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>Mia. Oh, yeah. I did acrobatics and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>some gymnastics in high school, and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>Iused to climb a lot of trees when I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>was a kid. I was a tomboy. I never
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>performed, but I wanted to. In high
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>school I was too afraid, so I became
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>a hippy instead.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>The minute I got out of college,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>though, I decided I was going to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>dancer, and I went off to Utah for a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>six-week summer dance thing. I end
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>ed up in a comedy routine there, in
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>stead of a dance piece. It was the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>NO? Did you learn on the ground
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>first?
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Mia. You start on a little trapeze.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Then we suddenly went up to about
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>twenty-four feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Donna. At the Cathedral, we’d have
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>one trapeze at, say, thirteen, fifteen
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>feet, and the other around twenty
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>seven feet. We would have a mat un
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>derneath us at the low one and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>would practice new tricks on that,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>so if I fell, l’d just go onto the mat
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and there’d be no problem. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>when we felt we were strong enough
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>down below, we’d take it “upstairs.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Nina and Gregory say “upstairs.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>That’s because they’re Russian. In
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stead of saying, “Go up on the high
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>one, they just say, “Okay, upstairs
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>now... So we’d go upstairs and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>take the tricks up there. And that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>how it would be.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>one funny dance piece, right? Where
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I came out on roller skates,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>screamed, banged cymbals and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>threw zucchini across the stage. I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>could see that dance wasn’t for me. I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>did acrobatics, sort of, and I paint
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ed. And then Nina and Gregory
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>showed up and fulfilled all the things
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that hadn’t been fulfilled.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Nina and Gregory taught both of you
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>how to work together in a trapeze
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>act?
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Mia. They taught us everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>You speak about trapeze work so
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>casually, as if the question, “Do you
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>want to go up on a trapeze?” were
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>an everyday one.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Mia. I wasn’t afraid until we went
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>up high, and then I was petrified.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>How high is high?
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Mia. In the circus this summer, we
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>worked at thirty feet. At the Brook-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>lyn Academy of Music, we looked
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>down on the top row.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>You work with nets, Iassume.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Donna. No.
			</p>
			<pb n='49'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>What does the catcher do, specif
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ically?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Mia. I hang by my knees and I hold
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>onto Donna.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>That’s making it sound very simple.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>You do more than that.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Mia. Well, just literally, that’s what
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Ido. The act has basically three and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>a half parts.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Donna. We open with both of us
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>hanging from the double trapeze by
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>one knee, touching our feet to the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>back of our heads. Then we do some
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>splits in the air.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mia. We do a thing where l’m hang
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ing by my knees, and Donna lowers
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>her legs to me. She lets go of the rope
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and we swing out. Then, we do
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>something called corbetts, which are
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>hand-foot exchanges. We do a series
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of these, and then we do something
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>called The Angel. Then, we do the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>one-arm. The third part of the act,
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Donna climbs up, and we use the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ring. She does a heelcatch and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>hangs by her heels. After the ring
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>comes the finale, which is a spin.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>We’re locked together, arms around
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>each other’s pelvis, spinning around.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Why were you chosen to do the hold-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ing? Is it your musculature? Your
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>arms? What?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Mia. I got really strong last summer
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>doing adagio. Then I worked ring
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>crew, hammering stakes in with a
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>sledgehammer. My upper body got
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>very strong. The thing I had to train
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>most was not my arms, but my legs,
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>because your hamstrings have to be
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>strong so you don’t fall off the bar.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>You’re holding not only yourself, but
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>somebody else—a total of about 220
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>pounds.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>So there’s a great deal of stress and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>weight right down onto your calves.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Behind the knees, right?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Mia. Yes. My calves used to bleed. It
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>was awful for a while, but they final-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ly healed over and got strong.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>How much do you weigh?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Mia. I don’t know, somewhere be-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tween 120 and 125.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Donna. A hundred, but sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>l’m a little up and sometimes, a little
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>down. Right now, l’m probably a lit-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tle up.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Mia. She’s just the right weight.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>How old are you?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Mia. Twenty-seven.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Donna. Twenty-four.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>How much did you have to practice
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to learn to do this?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Mia. Oh, we worked five days a
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>week—some days two hours, some
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>days four or five.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Donna. We would do this in the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>morning, then run to our jobs.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>What kind of jobs did you have?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Mia. I worked in a bakery, rolling
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>croissants on Grand Street.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>Donna. And I was in a hat-check
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>room in an Italian restaurant.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N004'/>Mia. Anything I could get.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N005'/>Donna. I did some modeling. I did all
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N006'/>sorts of things.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N007'/>Are you close friends, outside of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N008'/>working together?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N009'/>Mia and Donna. Now we are!
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N010'/>Mia. I didn’t know anything about
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N011'/>Donna until we started working to
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N012'/>gether.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N013'/>Donna. We had good feelings, but
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N014'/>we never went out together. We just
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N015'/>would see each other in passing on
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N016'/>the street.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N017'/>When you started working together,
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N018'/>did your relationship change?
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N019'/>Donna. We were working together
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N020'/>every day. She would drop me and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N021'/>say, “T’m sorry.” I would kick her in
			</p>
			<pb n='50'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the face and apologize. I was aching
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>so badly in the beginning, my hands
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>would rip open, l’d be dying! After
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ward, we would go home and each
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>go our own way. Still, when you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>with someone so long... Finally,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>when we started getting a good grip
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>on things, we had more time to just
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>be with each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Mia. When you’re up thirty feet in
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the air, you get to know someone!
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Donna. Even before we were really
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>good friends, I had a lot of trust in
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Mia. I just put an enormous amount
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of confidence in you—even more
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>than you had in yourself. Because
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that one time we fell, I was sure we
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>weren’t going to fall.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Mia. She went up thirty feet in the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>air and wasn’t afraid at all. Every
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>day when I got up, l’d want to throw
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>up, because I knew I had to go to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>practice. It was terrible. It didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>matter what trick I learned, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>still scared. You can teach anyone
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the physical stuff, but you’ve got to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>be able to be right there if something
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>goes wrong. Like the times when
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>we’ve been performing, and I only
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>grabbed one of her hands instead of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>both.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Donna. That’s the thing. She keeps
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>her mind up there.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Mia. You have to not freak out. You
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>have to say, “Okay, now we’ll just
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>keep going.” The other day, the cor
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>bett didn’t work. I whispered to Don
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>na, “Do it again.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Donna. That’s another reason why
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>we fit our parts well. She’s up there,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>she’s together, she has control. But
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>l’m pretty much carefree. Gregory
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>can tell me to do just about anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>He might say, “Okay, jump back-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ward, stand on your head.” l’d just
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>try it without thinking. It makes a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>good team because you have a little
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>bit of this and a little bit of that.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Mia. If a mistake happens, she can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>compensate for it. I have to, because
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>l’m the one that’s on the bar. She
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>manipulates her body, but I manipu
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>late her in the air. I have to go with
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>her tempo, and if something doesn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>go right, I have to use muscle to com
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>pensate for it.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>So, you’re responsible for both of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>you.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>Mia. In a sense Donna is, too. If she
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>does something completely ridicu
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>lous, it’s a real bummer. It works
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>both ways.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>Have you ever lost your grip?
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>Mia. Once we fell off. When we’re
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>performing, we use a cable belt for
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>the hand-to-hand and the ring, but
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>my instinct is not to let go of her
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>even if I fell off the bar.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>Donna. In the beginning, we would
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>just practice one section, then an
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>other section, but we never ever put
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>the whole thing together. All of a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>sudden, we had some benefit to do
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>and our trainers said, “Okay, girls,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>let’s try it in front of a crowd.” It
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>was our first performance.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>Mia. It’s different to do these things
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>in front of a crowd, because the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>strain builds up.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>Donna. The adrenalin builds up too,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>and it wastes your energy.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>Mia. We were in the ring part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>act, and I fell off.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Donna. I did the heelcatch; it was al
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>most over.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Mia. And we just fell off! She had a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>black eye! I wasn’t even afraid of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>falling; I was just worried it was go-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing to mess up the act.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Donna. After that, our trainer came
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>up to us and said, “No blood, no
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>blood. Okay, climb the ladder and
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>finish. So we did, and we were
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>stunned. Got up, climbed the ladder,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and did that thing where we spin
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>around.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Mia. We spun around so many times,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Gregory kept saying, “You can stop
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>now, you can stop now!&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Do you check your rigging your
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>selves?
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Mia. Every day, every place we go.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>After the spin, Donna does the iron
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>jaw where she hangs by her teeth.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>What’s the strap? Leather?
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Mia. Yeah, leather. It’s made to fit
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>her mouth.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Donna. People always say, “Your
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>teeth!&quot; but it’s not your teeth, it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>your neck. That’s the only place l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ever had pain, really. My fillings are
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>falling out of my teeth now. My God,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>my mother! She doesn’t know about
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>this. When I was a kid, I had ortho-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>dontic work, and if she knew I was
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>hanging by my teeth, she would just
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>see thousands of dollars going down
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the drain. In fact, my fillings are just
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>falling out, so I have to go to the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>dentist, but l’m afraid to tell him I do
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>this.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Mia. Why don’t you go to a different
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>dentist? I have one around the cor
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ner. Maybe he can make something
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>for you like a brace that you wear
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>just to keep your teeth in a certain
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>position while you’re hanging, but
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>then you couldn’t smile.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Traditionally, I believe, there’s usu
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ally a man in trapeze acts, as d
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>catcher. Could you talk about what&apos;s
			</p>
			<pb n='51'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>involved in the differences of work
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ing with women—just the two of you
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>together—as opposed to working
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with a man?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Mia. I think it’s pretty unique. Usual
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ly, it’s a man and a woman. The man
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>does what I do.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Donna. I have never seen a man do
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ing double trapeze. l’ve seen men in
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cradles, l’ve seen men on perches,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>but I haven’t seen any men doing
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>what we’re doing.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Mia. I saw one picture of a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>hanging by her knees holding a guy,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>but I never saw a woman holding a
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>woman like we do.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>What’s unique about working with
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>another woman?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Donna. Audiences, and people in
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>general, believe that a woman would
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>never be strong enough to hold an
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>other woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Mia. I don’t think it’s strange, be
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cause l’m doing it. l’m in the middle
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ofit, and I think, “This is what I do.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>I like working with women. l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>never worked with a man in the cir
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>cus. I never had a male partner, so I
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>don’t know what that’s like, but
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>when you work with someone, you
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>work with them. It’s what you do.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>What’s weird is the way people re-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>act. It’s like when I drove a truck for
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>U.P.S. I worked for the circus re
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>cently driving a truck. People react
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>very strangely. “Hey, baby, can you
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>handle it?” Even the women freak
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>out, and that, to me, is what&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>strange. There are lots of strong
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>women—all the women in the circus
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>are strong. That’s just the way it is.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Do you work at all with the element
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>of femaleness?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Mia. The whole act is feminine. The
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>opening is all splits and things you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>not going to get a guy to go up there
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>and do. It’s an image: you wear lots
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>of makeup and glitter; you wear cos
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>tumes that are cut way up in the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>back. To me, it’s very sexy. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>mind it. On a very crass level, the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>circus is about sex and death: Are
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>they going to fall? How scary is it go
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing to get?” And it’s also about being
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>attractive. I don’t mind being real
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>“traditional female. I’m doing
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>something which I always thought
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was amazing. I always wanted to be
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>really strong. I didn’t like the idea of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>being female and being weak. It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>nice, you’re both things. You don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>lose your sex by doing this.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Who does your costumes?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mia. We designed them and made
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>them ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Donna. We got into it little by little.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>At first Mia didn’t wear any ear
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>rings because Iused to kick them out
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>every so often. Gradually we started
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>adding on. The earrings got bigger,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the eye makeup got more dramatic.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>By the end of the season, we were
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>full-fledged circus women.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Mia. I always had this desire when I
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was a kid to wear things that glit-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tered, but it was gauche. You didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>do it. And now, in the circus, it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>legitimate. As a matter of fact,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>you’re supposed to do it. So I feel l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>allowed to do what I always wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to do, which is not only to be strong,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>but to get dressed up: makeup, spar
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>kling earrings, rhinestones.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Donna. Another thing that happened
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>with all the women in the circus—
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>we would all change in one trolley
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>car—all of us would get our periods
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>around the same time, within days of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>each other every woman involved in
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the show would have her period.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Where have you performed?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Mia. We performed at the Brooklyn
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Academy of Music last Easter with
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the Big Apple Circus. We gave some
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>benefit performances, always with
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the Big Apple Circus because Nina
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and Gregory were affiliated with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Donna. The circus season ended, but
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>now the director might find some
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>things for us to do, or make up little
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>package deals. But we’re pretty
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>much on our own now to find work
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>for the coming year.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Mia. We want to go back into train-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ing. There are more things to learn.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The act isn’t really finished.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Do you have an agent?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Mia. Not yet.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Donna. That’s what we need next.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>We’re working on that, getting to
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>gether pictures and a brochure.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>How much did you perform?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mia. Ten shows a week.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Donna. Two shows a day. Exhaust-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ing, especially during the hot spell.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The top of the tent is always ten de
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>grees hotter than down below. When
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>we climbed the ladder, every rung
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>would be steaming hot. The ring was
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>so hot, Mia’s hands got burned from
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>holding it.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>How does your personal relationship
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>affect the act? And how does your
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>working relationship affect you
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>socially?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Donna. If ever one of us is really
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>down and bummed out, it always
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>works out that the other one pulls
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>her through. We hold each other to
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>gether. For the most part, we sense
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>each other’s moods so well, so far.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>So you’re emotionally very sup-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>portive of each other?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Mia. We have to be.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Donna. Once, we both went up there
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>feeling down. It was terrible, but we
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>did a good show. In spite of it, we did
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>a great show.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>So, in a sense, your work allows you
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to forget a lot of the problems of your
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>life?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Mia. You have to leave it behind.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Donna. You have to leave your
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>troubles behind the curtains.

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>off to work in the cities. They re

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ding for the cows. I stay in front of
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the fire only when it snows. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>summer, we have to bring in the hay

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>portant on the land because they
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>can do the same work as the men. If
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>there is something to be done and
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>one is busy, the other just does it;
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>there is no importance as to who
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>does what.

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>There were two sisters, neither of
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>whom ever married. They had lived
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>their entire lives together in the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>same house, situated at the outskirts
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of a tiny village. They worked their
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>land together; one tended the cows,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the other the sheep. They could usu

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>as they watched their flocks. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>spring, they ploughed the fields with
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>a team of oxen; one sister guided
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>while the other followed behind with
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the plow. Their lives were regulated
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>by the cycles of the land and the

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>would give me a chance to be in the

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tense each time she comes into my

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>This analysis seemed to contain a

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>says the cause is our mothers, or

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>feminists. So often women seemed to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>end up in intimacies of twos and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>threes: two sisters, gossiping idly
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>about a third; three sisters, allying
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>themselves against a mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I have a friend who speaks of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>“women seizing power with a quiv
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ering chin.” Women in this era have
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>two scripts for getting what we
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>want. The first is to take care of,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with the hope of being taken care of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in return. The second is to be direct
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and take what we want. The first is
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>familiar; the second, unfamiliar and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>frightening. Unfortunately, the first
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>script has been crazily overlaid with
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the script of socialist feminism,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>which says to look out for people
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>weaker than you, which condemns
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>competitiveness, and which calls
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>hierarchy and status differences
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>evil. When women seize power with
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>a quivering chin, it is because they
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>do not want to give up the first
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>script. But it is also, particularly
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>among women who see themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>as socialist-feminists, often because
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>they do not want to be condemned
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>for wanting power and position—in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a rotten system to boot.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>The problem with the university,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>as with any rigid hierarchy, is that it
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>does not leave many pleasant alter
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>natives to climbing the ladder and

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>and powers. To be marginal, on the

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>this is nearly an impossible task. The
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>space of equality is small, cramped,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>often no wider than the space of

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Many days I walked about in the

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I have talked at length about

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>fear of confronting them. Yet the soft

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>it might, was the issue of lesbianism.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Women, both faculty and students,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>spent most, if not all, of their time
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>with other women. Intense relation
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ships developed, particularly among
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>students who had few resources
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>outside the college. In fact, after a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>time in the program, students seemed
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>always to come in twos. And whether
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the women in these couples were
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>heterosexual or gay, the attractions
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that had drawn them to each other
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>were probably erotic as well as in

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>among women faculty — although
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>these were diffused and disguised.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Academic constraints made it essen

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>particularly and visibly with men. (I
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>remember a lovely picnic on the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>grass with two other women which

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>our jobs by going off together rather
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>than spending the time talking to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>other professors in the lunchroom.)
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>There was nothing so extra
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ordinary about the varieties of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>relationships among women. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>extraordinary that they took place in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a sphere of suspicion, fear and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>silence. Courses only rarely dealt
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>openly with lesbianism; papers on
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the topic were discouraged, and out
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>side speakers rarely mentioned the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>issue. A number of gay women never
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>came out in the program, sensing
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>quite rightly that they would only
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>cause themselves pain. Fear of the

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>so great that women’s relationships
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>in general were rarely discussed.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Once again, all this could easily be
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>justified by the university’s homo-
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>phobia, and thus the women’s studies

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>were themselves afraid of homo
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>sexuality indeed, they had been

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>chosen at times because of that fear.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>On this issue, at least, they did not

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>own interests.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>There is a paradox in the univer

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>learning would make natural. I often
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>had the feeling that women in our

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>college, adopted behavior that was a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>combination of (1) conscious but
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>unexamined male patterns and (2)
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>unconscious female patterns. This
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>combination fit in nicely with the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>purposes of the university, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was not particularly liberating. And
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>it did not have any relationship to

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>are doing seems larger than the creation of a feminist business.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>We daily make presumptions that determine our decisions. Other fem
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>inists may make other presumptions, as valid or more so than ours, but
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>these are ours. We feel uncertain and incomplete about them. They are
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>working” propositions.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>We believe that designing a restaurant-bookstore, the way the space
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was laid out (by two feminist architects), the kind of furniture we chose
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and refinished ourselves, the site we picked (secluded, on the water, land
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for an herb garden), the women’s music we play as background, all are
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>expressions of our beliefs and will, subliminally at least, affect everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>who comes in. Our self-service policy came out of a desire to use our energy
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>(and payroll) for cooking and the necessary cleaning up rather than provid
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ing servants, with the concomitant demeaning feelings that accompany that
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>relationship on both sides.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>We call ourselves a collective, which for us does not mean equal mon
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>etary investment but does mean equal time and energy in Bloodroot. We
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>don’t depend on volunteers, funding or grants. We don’t want a large part-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>time collective in which members’ time and energy goes elsewhere and in
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>which responsibility and power are too diffuse. Our hours and commitment
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>are, and have to be (we believe), total.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Of course, this means we give up our “personal” lives to put full time
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>(and more) into our venture. We have been scared and sometimes resentful,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as when we had to miss a conference or concert. But in this process of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>creating our own space we have also been surprised by our own responses.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>One is that what precious little time off we have we want to spend at Blood
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>root—weeding, eating, visiting. There seems no other world we are nourished
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>in, or even feel at ease in. Secondly, our commitment to this place, this idea,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>grows all the time. Our lives are intense. We work physically very hard,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>long hours; we laugh and sometimes even wrestle (for fun) in full view of the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>customers. We quarrel; we are lovers; there are jealousies. But I think we
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>all feel passionately that Bloodroot is our lover, our creation, larger than
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ourselves. We discover how precious it is to us and we believe that what we
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>are doing is of value to other women.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>We started as three; when it became evident that one part-time worker’s
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>commitment was growing as large as ours, it became an organic necessity to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>add a fourth, even though we were hesitant about this enlargement. A whole
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>new chemistry took place with the changed status of the new collective
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>member, which was unexpected—as unexpected as egg yolks, lemon juice
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and oil producing mayonnaise! It is likely that future collective members will
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>similarly make themselves evident as time goes by, but a small ultimate size
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>still seems desirable.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Nevertheless, we need to know how to give recognition in shades of gray,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to acknowledge the women other than collective members whose love of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>working with us and efficiency in so doing help make Bloodroot possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>One woman who works with us Sundays only has been fully with us from the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>start. She says we restore her for her political fights in her straight job
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>during the week, and she certainly feeds us and what we do through her
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>skills and her efforts. Another woman works for us five days a week (28
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>hours), even paying baby sitters for the privilege of earning minimum wage.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>We wish we could pay day care for her! A feminist structure should, but we
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>simply don’t have the funds. She is spending extra time at home trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>reorganize our bookstore records, and yet we don’t know how to name hei

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>role or account appropriately for what she does.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Hardest to deal with is why it doesn’t work out with all women who come
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in as staff; some, who obviously want to be with us, just don’t do things right.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I can’t understand why in a political way. It seems like a failure of will on
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>their part, or of priorities. Maybe they can’t take their own work seriously,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>it is casual, like play. Maybe doing work for a woman’s space feels no more
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>important than volunteer work—but all this seems inadequate as an ex
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>planation.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>And then we are faced with the need to fire someone, a woman like us, to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>damage her pride perhaps more than the outside world has. We have done
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>it well maybe once, and we don’t feel that we know how to do it properly
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>We try to remember that women have been social service agencies to others
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>all our lives, and that we will not survive as a business or as individuals
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>unless we demand adequate performance from those we work with, rather
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>than having to cover for their errors. But still, it is most agonizing to us.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We have other problems. We don’t know where to get expert help. Our
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>feminist lawyers and accountants, trained in the outside world, often give
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>advice that is useless or wrong. For example, we were incorporated, a legal
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>structure that we are unsure how to use to reflect what is more like a part
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>nership. Our accountant recommends advertising and marketing techniques
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that seem inappropriate to our kind of business. We trust these women, but
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>they don’t seem to know how to apply their world knowledge to our feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>political business.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>We don’t really know good feminist management techniques—where to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>save money and where to spend it, how to assess financial growth, how to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>project future needs. Our most useful advice in these directions was free:
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Jill Ward of Mother Courage urged us to experiment in our own ways, yet
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>was very specific about what she had found useful; a customer/friend/tax
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>attorney helped us daydream/brainstorm about our future.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>We have in the past had trouble dealing with “friendly” criticism, that
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>is, criticism from our supposed friends who would never make comments in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>straight places over similar issues (prices, what brands of beer we carry,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>what kinds of pots we use). We have developed a thicker skin and have
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>redefined who our friends are as a result; it can be argued that this means
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>we will not hear “appropriate” criticism. Right, we won’t! We can’t, and
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>survive.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Our biggest problem right now is bringing in enough money to survive,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>knowing what books or foods will sell, how to learn what we need to know-
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>how to find time to learn! But we do, we are. We’ve developed our own
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>bookkeeping techniques, invented our own recipes, figured our own ways of
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>dividing work. It’s just that much much more needs doing, needs learning.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>as we try many new modes and share what we learn...

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I work in a feminist restaurant/bookstore. I get up around 8:30, shower,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>dress, and read or write before I go to work around 10. We, the collective,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>go over and organize the day’s work. We prepare food all day, serve fromt
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>or 7 until 11 P.M., then clean up and go home. Tuesdays and Sundays are
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>partial days, and Mondays everyone rests. During the working day we take
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>breaks for eating, smoking or resting as we need them and as they are
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>possible. Everyone, I think, inwardly measures her own amount of work and
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>judges everyone else’s.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We all work very hard. For me it is not innately pleasurable, nor do I feel
			</p>
			<pb n='69'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_1' n='N001'/>particularly talented at it. After a year and a half I have acquired a very
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_2' n='N002'/>modest competence. It does not feel very rewarding most of the time. I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_3' n='N003'/>connected, but not close to, the women I work with, who comprise my entire
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_4' n='N004'/>family/community. I choose to stay for a number of reasons, some silly and
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_5' n='N005'/>some serious. One is certainly the food and books; another is the limited
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_6' n='N006'/>security of a nice quiet place to live and $300 a month (the zenith of my
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_7' n='N007'/>material wealth). The main reason, I think, is my lack of boredom in learning
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_8' n='N008'/>about food and plants. I also need to live in the world of women, however
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_9' n='N009'/>piecemeal that world might be, however ill-equipped I am for it.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_10' n='N010'/>The conditions that are most difficult for me are:
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_11' n='N011'/>1) The optimism and resultant depression of the women I work with.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_12' n='N012'/>There is no reason to think we will not be killed, die young or suck each other
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_13' n='N013'/>dry in our gasping for breath. If we could all begin now consciously to recog-
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_14' n='N014'/>nize our marginal status, something other than the failed fantastic could be
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_15' n='N015'/>accomplished. Our reluctance to associate with the real inescapable world
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_16' n='N016'/>is a continuation of private fantasies of our unique character and indom
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_17' n='N017'/>itable will; we are not accessible to the fate of the millions we are trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_18' n='N018'/>change. (I keep thinking of the tragic wasted life of Simone Weil, who fought
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_19' n='N019'/>everyone’s war but her own because she couldn’t remember herself as a
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_20' n='N020'/>woman or a Jew. Cut off from any personal memory of class pain, she tried
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_21' n='N021'/>to brutalize herself into feeling by starvation and overwork. It’s the irony of
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_22' n='N022'/>her inability to take, or receive, life from her own origins that she starved to
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_23' n='N023'/>death.)
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_24' n='N024'/>2) My lack of intellectual or emotional intimacy with the lesbian/fem
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_25' n='N025'/>inist community. It’s partially, and very consciously, self-imposed. I have
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_26' n='N026'/>lived and worked in other lesbian/feminist communities and have not, on
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_27' n='N027'/>the whole, found my deeper concerns too well regarded. Quite the contrary.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_28' n='N028'/>I tend to save my intellectual and emotional energy for writing and reading,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_29' n='N029'/>which is fairly consistently rewarding. I have an acute loneliness, which is
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_30' n='N030'/>accentuated by being physically surrounded by a close community of which
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_31' n='N031'/>I partake little. I must, however, trust my reluctance for self-exposure.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_32' n='N032'/>3) The general passion women seem to have for collectives (surely the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_33' n='N033'/>least distinctive of anything that might be useful in leftist thought). With no
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_34' n='N034'/>demand for definition inherent in the collective structure, there is an almost
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_35' n='N035'/>tidal pull toward obscuring whatever functions do go on. We must name the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_36' n='N036'/>kinds of work involved in our operations and have structures that make our
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_37' n='N037'/>processes clear. While it is certainly our private resources that determine
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_38' n='N038'/>our public functioning, the great danger in collectives is that there is no
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_39' n='N039'/>mechanism for the allocation of our private resources. I think this leads to
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_40' n='N040'/>more homogeneous associations of women, which I feel are less valuable.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_41' n='N041'/>There are so many possibilities between collectives and hierarchies that I
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_42' n='N042'/>don’t understand why women are so dogged about clinging to one or the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_43' n='N043'/>other.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_44' n='N044'/>I hope this is useful as a rather feeble beginning to thinking about work.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_tl_45' n='N045'/>It has certainly been valuable for me to think about.

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>most important imperative for my life.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The particular form the woman’s space took was a restaurant and a
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>bookstore. I began with no knowledge of cooking, running a bookstore or
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>“business management,” but with the seeds of a feminist dream which in
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>time germinated into reality! As I had no access to money, my contribution
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to Bloodroot was time and determined energy. I moved from living alone in
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the city to the suburban house where two other Bloodroot women were living.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I had strong anxieties about living with them and having no money (I had
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>left a 990-a-week isolated child-care job from which I had saved no money).
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>But my determination to work and create Bloodroot was stronger, and it
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sustained me during both the early transition and the later problems of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>living together. There were times of emotional jealousies among the three of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>us, and acute arguments about “collectivity” and “spirituality.” Our dif

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>gions (two Protestants, one Jew) seemed at times to be tremendous ob
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>stacles. Certainly I was sometimes overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>over our unequal experience. Each of us had her own ways of using or
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>misusing anger, and the pressure/exhaustion of running a full-time res
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>taurant allowed no vacation from each other and very little space to avoid
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>clashes. Yet our common ground was (and is) a commitment to an emerging
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>lesbian/feminist politics and the building of a woman’s space. We agreed to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>keep our group small, play only women’s music with feminist content, im
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>plement self-service, share an equal salary and try to survive economically
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>These areas of agreement at the beginning enabled Bloodroot to grow, and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>eventually to absorb a fourth member with a similar political commitment.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Working at Bloodroot includes a familiar and painful “problem,” in

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>can be violently disrupted by the deadlocking pattern of these relationships.

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>I was born a woman, knowing and wise. By the time I could talk I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>things were wrong, absolutely upside down. Everything told me I was worth-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>less in myself, evil, selfish, abnormal. All I have ever had to go by, the only
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>truth l’ve ever known, is some deep, deep place inside me. After trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>conform, I knew I had to get out. Being a lesbian was not enough; if I was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>still playing it their way, accepting their jobs and keeping quiet about the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>rest, I was not living with dignity. Of course not; I was fitting into a sys

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to do until women realize what is happening. Each of us, on her own, must
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>know what is happening and not be a part of it anymore.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>As an old dyke, when the women’s movement took hold, I thought it was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>just a bunch of privileged straight women who had nothing better to do. I
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>never felt they could or would make any difference to my life. I was even
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>embarrassed by them. As a dyke, I wanted to stay inconspicuous, so I
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>couldn’t get involved anyway. When the straight women became lesbians I
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was sure it was for “political” reasons. I was repelled by them. They could
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>not possibly understand a “real lesbian” like me. They hadn’t suffered like
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>me. They had been accepted and acceptable all their lives. They didn’t live
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>a lie, with the fear and self-loathing I had. Their lesbianism must be a
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>gimmick.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>From where I am now I see that they discovered as adults something
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>which I had known as a child: as women in this world, we are next to worth-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>less. Somehow I knew this and chose to be a lesbian early. I was not con

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>political” lesbians. So much is clear to me now, living and working with

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>waking life. Our paths have converged and we recognize each other. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>always afraid out there, without being conscious of the reasons why, not
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>understanding the violence around me in that man’s world. I was afraid to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>be, because I didn’t fit. Although my lovers were all women, we based our
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>relationships on male models—two people mutually dependent and ex
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>clusive. Why didn’t they work? Why didn’t they last? Living with women,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>making love with more than one woman, I am no longer afraid of losing
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>myself in another woman; the unifying force is something other than the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>relationship itself. Yet I have not sacrificed the closeness and intimacy I
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>need with other women. There is no line drawn between any of the aspects
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>of our lives: politics, spirituality, work, play, living are all one.

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>after you cry, you go home. You

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>got the back. I sulked for two days.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Then, incredibly, Blythe sacrificed
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her space. She gave it to me! What a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>victory! I accepted, and basked in
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>her donation. After all, I had started
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the whole thing, hadn’t 1? Such was
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>my ego, and such was my sad at
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tempt to try to corner a little piece of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the action. This was not an isolated
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>incident; other people behaved
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>crazily, too. When you’re starved,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>you certainly lose perspective. And
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>we lost it all the time. The nit-picking
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>over that wall extended to the num
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ber of inches forward or back it
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>would be on the floor. I remember
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>that Sue Williams and I went in to do
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>battle one day, armed with a roll of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>masking tape. (We were going to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mark down where that wall be-
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>longed before anyone else did, by
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>God) I don’t know if the other women
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>brought tape or not, but there we
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>were, waging a totally idiotic war
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>over the control of the wall! It was
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>demolished after only one season,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>because it really cut up the space.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Now, the only corollary I can find
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>for this distorted behavior is that of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>most artists prior to a show. Classi
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>cally, we fight with our mates, we
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>don’teat, or we eat too much. We cry
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and are moody, hate having sex, or
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>can’t get enough. In other words,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>there is a tremendous amount of ex
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>plosive, aberrant behavior in those
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>months when the pressure is on to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>finish up—to get the work out there.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I think now it hadn’t to do with our
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>being women but with our being
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>artists. In 1971-72, not many of us
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>had much experience in bargaining
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>or negotiation for what we wanted.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>So many of us had been ignored or
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>cloistered that there hadn’t been
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>anything to bargain for. Thus we
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>were exceptionally raw, anxious and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sometimes desperate.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Another aspect of A.I.R. was the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>way we grouped ourselves. We split
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>into factions like members of a prim
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>itive tribe who change the positions
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of their doorways each week to show
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>which member of the family they are
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>arguing with.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>It was Howardena Pindell who
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>named us—“Jane Eyre, she said.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Then, Air, A.I.R., Artists-In-Res-
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>idence.” How wonderful! It was one
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>of the few moments when we all
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>agreed. We helped each other in the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>beginning. We had to, to help our
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>selves. Later, people withheld infor
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>mation. No one knew who was in
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>town, what collector was seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>what work, what shows were in the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>offing; yet to do this, too, ultimately
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>was asking too much of one another.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>We did succumb in many ways to
			</p>
			<pb n='84'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the pressures of the art world and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>its competitiveness, while telling
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>each other that we never would, that
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>A.I.R. was the real alternative. Being
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>generous was almost impossible.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I was impatient. I expended too
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>much energy too fast and wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>recompense. I think this was true for
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Sue Williams (the other co-founder),
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>too. Having started A.I.R., it was
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>very difficult to relinquish our initial
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>roles. We were seen unavoidably as
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>authority figures, and there was
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>considerable hostility against us
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>from various quarters. At meetings
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>there were those of us with short
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>fuses who screamed and stormed.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Others, quieter and more devious,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>acted calmly, planned strategically
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and talked behind members&apos; backs.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>But this was all a question of style
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and not of our femaleness.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I used to think it was just women:
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>men, or men and women could
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>never, ever get into mean, ridiculous
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>discussions like ours. Then I talked
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to friends who went to monthly meet-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ings of their co-op buildings, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>attended faculty meetings at the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>schools where I began to teach. I
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>realized that basically all groups are
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>pretty much the same: some people
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>are jockeying for power, others are
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>along for the ride and others are
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>simply obnoxious. But most tedious
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>are those who are fanatically fair.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Total democracy made it impossible
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to make any decisions about any-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>thing in less than three hours.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>My feelings about A.I.R. now are
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>bittersweet; it’s a lot like being able
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to let go of a child. If you’ve raised an
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>offspring well, then he or she has a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>unique, internal rhythm; the child
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>develops in his or her own way, and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>not according to the way you might
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>have chosen. My hopes for A.I.R.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>were based on my control, on shap
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ing my own idea. Rationally, I recog
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>nize quite clearly that that’s not the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>way things work. When I walk into
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the gallery these days to see a show,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>often no one there knows who 1 am,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and even fewer people know I start-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ed it. I am selfish; I wish they all
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>knew and would bow down and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>thank me. On the other hand, I am
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>glad the gallery is autonomous, that
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>it is its own baby now.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Lacking perhaps, was an absence
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of largesse, an ability to be reflec
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tive. In my opinion, this shortsighted
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ness prevented our using A.I.R. as a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>platform for something much larger
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>—something on the scale, say, of The
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Institute for Art and Urban Re
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sources. However, that is an or
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ganization essentially controlled by
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>one individual. A.I.R. responsibility
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>wasn’t freely allocated in any area.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>People were too often called to ac

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>cisions, major and minor. This lack of
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>trust, and general paranoia, contrib
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>uted most to the dilution of A.I.R.&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>strengths. But again, this kind of be
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>havior is a disease of the Western
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>World and is not to be confused with
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>our being women.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Because people were so loathe to
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>delegate power and to realize that

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>fought with one another. Many peo
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ple may not believe this, may think
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>things are substantially different
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>now. They’re not. As far as women

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>In trying to bring my thoughts
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>about A.I.R. together, I find I had

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>many members. I often felt it a priv

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>experience the impact of their per
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>sonalities and their work. A.I.R. was
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a sorority of women who, under any
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>other set of circumstances, would
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>never have joined one. I have made
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>friends through A.I.R. whom I hope I
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>will always know. My contact with
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>several members has fostered a vital
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>dialogue about work that is invalu

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lery is that you show what you want
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>when you want how you want—you
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>don’t have to convince anyone of
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>anything. If your work changes dras
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tically, you don’t have to worry
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>about whether your dealer will still
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>want to show it; you are your dealer.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>And you don’t have to be polite. But
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>you do have to pay, and meet, and

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>We gave an informal evening course

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>was the encouragement of others in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the group that spurred our growth.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>We gave the course twice again over
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the next year to women who had
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>heard of it from friends. At the end
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of each course, anyone from the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>group who wanted to go elsewhere
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and run a similar program did so,

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>joined those who stayed in the core
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>group, to help research and write up
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>more information. And so the course
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>spread and the group gained in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>diversity and strength.

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>this fluidity would have been prob

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>attendance is crucial. Since re

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>November 1971, a core group of

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and decided not to take in any more

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Another thing that contributed to

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>in the group worked to pull our many
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>papers together into a newsprint
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>book that was published later that

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>copies of the book were sold, mostly

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>word-of-mouth. We were able to

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>306; and the title, Women and Their

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>By this point, we were developing

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>sion about leadership. Two of us did
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a lot of phone calling about where
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the meetings would be. But if I said,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>“T’m too busy and I can’t make the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>calls, then someone else would.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Thus we established a fairly easy-

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the project. Each of us has emerged

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>has not always been adequate for

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>allocating work.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>From the beginning, we made our
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>decisions by consensus. Giving the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Women and Their Bodies” course
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the first time helped shape our sense
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of decision making in a nonhierar
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>chical group. Originally, our idea of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>structuring the course came from
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>our own schooling: we took an hour
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>or so to present the research and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>our responses to it, then opened up
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the meeting for discussion. But the

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>we were done “presenting. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>difficult for some of us to give up our

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>everyone got a full chance to speak
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and be heard. So the course format
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was not imposed by a leadership
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>group: it was based on an emerging
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>consensus of the core group and the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>new people. And it proved to be an

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>further shape. Teaching (or leading)
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was essentially sharing— making in
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>formation available and exploring
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>how it interacted with our own lives
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>so others could do the same. By par

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>than lecturing, we, as leaders,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>learned new information and gained
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>new insights each time we gave the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>course.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Our experiences in giving the

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ing sense that we operated with the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>most energy, effectiveness and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>authenticity when our decisions
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>were based on the shared ideas of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>every member. This conviction has
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>become stronger over the years. We
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>know that a powerful creative ener-

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>responsibility for the way the group
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>or project goes. To release that
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>energy, each of us has to know that
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>she can air any ideas, disagree

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>thing that women have perhaps al
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ways known: our feelings about a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>given subject are as important as
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the factual information about it, and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>any project or decision that leaves

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>learning. Sometimes after months of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>being stuck on a problem, we finally
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>take the time we need to speak about
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>our feelings, and to work through
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the difficult ones like anger, jealousy,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>exclusion, sadness. This process
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>takes a lot of time:
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Unlike almost every other group I
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>know, if we make a firm decision one

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>or two members have strong, serious
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and sincere reasons why they think
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that decision should be changed, we
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>almost always make time to listen to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>them, and even to act on their ideas.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>It’s impossibly frustrating some
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>times, but it’s also one of the reasons
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>why we’ve survived and still love
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Personal confrontation and careful
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>listening often make the process of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>coming to a consensus as meaningful
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>as the decision itself.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>l’ve noticed that I often don’t mind if
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>a consensus decision is different
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>from what I would like if I were de

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Time is teaching us flexibility: with
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>deadline pressures and the need for
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>quick and final choices, we try to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>streamline our system, so that not
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>everyone speaks on every point. If
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>we do want to say something we will
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>be heard, and that comes from the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>trust we have created with one an
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>other. As one of us said, “I think our

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tinue to exist.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Learning to function as a nonhier
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>archical group has presented us
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>with some painful issues involving
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>power. In the political groups (usu
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ally run by men) where many of us
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>had been active, we had seen how
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>all women and the less powerful
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>men had very little say in what went
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>on. In not wanting to repeat that
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>misuse of power, we took on an un-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>spoken ideal of leaderlessness. Yet
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>we have learned that every group
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>has leaders: the important thing is
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>how they lead. In retrospect, we can
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>see that our early idea of leader

			<pb n='89'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>lessness just pushed power conflicts
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>underground. For example, one of us
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was particularly active in the first
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>publishing project and in fact did
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>many hours of work singlehandedly.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>At that point in her life, taking a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>leadership role felt natural to her
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and met personal needs. The group,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in turn, needed her energy and per
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>severance for the book to come out
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>well. Yet over the months she held
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>an increasing influence in all aspects
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of our work. She was, for instance,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>better able than anyone else to sway
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the group’s decisions, or to come in
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>after a decision had been made and
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>turn it around. Without consciously
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>intending to, because of her engaging
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>personality and assertiveness, she
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>became the consistently dominant
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>figure in the group.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Tensions arose but it was a long
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>time before they were expressed.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Then our dissatisfaction took the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>form of intense individual conflicts
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>between this woman and other,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>more self-confident members of the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>group who felt their own roles
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>cramped by her influence. But it was
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>really a whole-group issue: although

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>with her, we resented her. As is so
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>often the case, we resented her be
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>cause we doubted our own worth in

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of inadequacy made us give her
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>more power than she perhaps even
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>wanted. After many months of build
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ing tension, all of us finally were
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>able to talk about our anger toward
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>her, and why we tended to invest
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>her with power. Our honesty freed
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>her to examine why she hąd moved
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>into that position, and to explore her

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>I feel,” she said, “that whenever

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>As she said recently, “After all those
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>years in men’s political groups,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I knew I didn’t want to do it their

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>they had, and that was power. I had
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to learn that you can have power
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>without dominating.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Gradually, a stronger sense of self
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>respect and equality has developed
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>among us, and we find ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>with a changed notion of what
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>power means for our group. In our
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>society, power usually operates as

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>One of the things we wrestled with
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in the dynamic just described was
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>our expectation that one member&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>But we’ve learned that there is a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>natural fluctuation between moving

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was perhaps the most difficult one

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>to tackle the kind of distribution we

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>major problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>When we laid aside our revision

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>a part of each of us wanted to ditch

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>old dynamic.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>As our workload and our royalty

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>work—seriously. It meant that we
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>didn’t have to find other jobs, but
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>could expand the group’s outreach.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>And personally it made a big dif

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>work that I love to do and I think is
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>important.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Over the next years, some of us
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>left, or didn’t seek, other jobs to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>work part-time for the collective. As
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>more of us began to depend on the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>collective for work and a salary, we
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>wondered how this new overlap be-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tween the group and our lives would
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>affect our policies and decisions.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Some of us were apprehensive.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Would we become more conser

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>give ourselves the same fair wages
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and benefits we’d seek from another
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>employer. In the heated debate that
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>led to acceptance of these policies,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>we finally recognized a fundamental

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>as well as a women’s group. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>words of one woman who was slow-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>est to accept the changes:
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>I think my resistance came from my
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>nostalgic fantasy about us as a

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>who gave away whatever money
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>they got. But the fact is that it makes
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sense to pay ourselves a decent
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>wage. I can see now that the employ-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ment policies we work out are an
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>important part of the evolution of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>women working together. But I also
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>want to say that it’s crucial to me,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and to all of us, that our money be
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>used not only to pay us for our health

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Questions remain. What is the

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>are the days when our work, body
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>education, was the central stuff of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>our personal sharing. Yet when we
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>let work pressures squeeze out time
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>for the personal discussion where
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>we find so much of our energy and

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as a group and are good neither for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>each other nor for our work.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>During one particularly hectic and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>uncentered period, one of our group
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>had a sterilization operation. Sev-

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>she needed our attention. In that
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>year of busyness we kept letting
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>other priorities crowd out her re

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>even responded as individuals. In
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>retrospect we can see that her
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>choice to be sterilized was threaten

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>more children, and that it seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>quite remote to others. Our unease,

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Many of us have ideas and dreams for new projects, but
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>what does it take to turn these notions into concrete
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>realities? We conducted a survey of women’s workgroups
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to discover the variety of their experiences and to explore
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>their common themes and their differences.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The two of us were members of the Heresies +7 collec

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>concerned with those work situations which have been
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>explicitly created by and for women. This led to a proposal
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to carry out a survey of women’s projects, which the collec

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Our joint venture grew out of a shared interest in politi

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Frequently asked for advice, she was aware that there was
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>little printed information available to suggest the range of
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>methods and goals that existed among women’s enter
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>prises. She was interested in comparing her own exper

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>women evaluate their efforts? How did they structure their
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>time and work? How much difference did capital or expert
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>advice make? What were projects doing about burnout?
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Linda was an unemployed anthropologist, trying to

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>option was to create or become involved in a feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>project. In the course of conducting the survey, she became
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>a volunteer at another local women’s bookstore and
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>seriously considered becoming a co-owner. Linda was in

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>out the project? Which needs were they able to meet?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We designed a questionnaire and gave it to several local
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>groups for feedback. As a result of that pre-test we revised
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the survey so that it would be more open-ended, and then
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sent it out to over 200 groups.1 Projects were selected from

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>bookstores throughout the United States. We could then
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>compare responses of similar enterprises that were geo

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>given questionnaires because of personal contacts.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Thirty-one groups responded to the revised survey.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Added to the six projects who sent back the earlier version,
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that gave us a total of 37 groups. These written accounts

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Who answered the questionnaire? Seventeen projects
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>were located in New York City. The other 20 were fairly

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Midwest and West.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Most of the responding groups were small: 19 projects
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>were started by either two or three women. Six groups were

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Twenty-one of the 37 groups were women’s bookstores.3

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>means that our results are skewed in the direction of enter
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>prises engaged in sales. Although the preponderance of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>bookstores can be seen as a limitation, we believe that the

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>parents, visited a bookstore in New York City, got lists and
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>started ordering and consigning art work. The whole process

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>enterprise was started by non-monogamous women, who
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>had known each other “a few years as friends and lovers
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>before beginning a restaurant/bookstore. Some members
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>felt that their relations were not particularly central to this
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>decision:
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>(We) don’t think our making love influenced the three of us so
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>much as our shared desire to do something at this time in our
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lives that reflected a more or less common political approach.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>... We each made love and/or became friends with other
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>women, mostly with those we work with (we have about six
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>staff other than ourselves) but sometimes other women
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>outside. Don’t feel lovemaking is important in a negative way.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Working relationship has been a struggle but has steadily
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>improved.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Another member of the same group said “Two of us
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>became not-lovers, which was difficult for the not-loved.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Clearly, one of the requirements of working in such a situa
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tion is the ability and willingness to deal with considerable
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>emotional change.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Two projects included a couple plus a third woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Three lesbians who had been friends for four years started
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>a bookstore. Two of them had been lovers for two to two
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and one-half years. Their closeness
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>made the project get moving better, but it was hard to find
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>women who wanted to work with us. A small part of this was
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>due to the strength of our relationships which was
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>intimidating.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Two years later, none of the original members were still
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>involved in the bookstore. This outcome was not described
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>as the result of problems with intimacy. They explained
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>that there was &quot;No money so we were always personally
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>broke which was the main thing that led all of us to leave
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>eventually.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Another bookstore was created by three women who ini-
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>tially had less symmetrical relationships than was true for
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the preceding project. We quote Mary, the “third” partner:
			</p>
			<pb n='106'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Two were living-together lovers; the third one knew one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>two lovers [Sarah] through work on a conference and did not
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>know the other one well at all.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>For the first two years of the store’s operation, Sarah
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>continued working at her former full-time job and was only
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>peripherally involved in day-to-day bookstore matters.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>That left the two women in charge who had the least
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>developed relationship. Their shared commitment to the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>project provided the incentive to get through the early
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>hassles. Indeed, Mary implies that their lack of intimacy
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>may have been an asset:
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The first two full-time members barely knew each other so
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>there were few expectations shattered; they circled each other
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>warily at first and eventually established patterns of working
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with each other. The goal was paramount (that is, establishing
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a place for women) so that personalities were secondary. There
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>is no doubt that subverting members’ personalities to the goal
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>resulted in “saner” work relationships. A year after [Sarah
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>joined, the relationship between the lovers broke up.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Lovers are not likely to consider the possibility that they
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>could break up when they begin projects together. One
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>couple in their twenties, for instance, started a screen
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>printing business after they had been together for six years:
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>We are two very loving women who relate and empathize with
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>each other. We know we work well together and it is incon
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ceivable to think we would not be together working and loving
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The combination of “working and loving” may be es
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>pecially beneficial for both couples and projects. However,
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the “inconceivable” can happen, though it may be difficult
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to anticipate.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>When intimates establish projects together, it is very
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>hard to ask questions that acquaintances might raise more
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>readily: What will happen if one of us wants to leave? What
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>will happen if one of us wants the other to leave? What will
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>happen to the project if our relationship breaks up? What
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>will happen to our relationship if the project succeeds or
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>fails? It may be that to discuss the possibility of an ending
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in any intimate relationship is taken as a signal that some
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>thing is wrong.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>One couple anticipated these kinds of difficulties. Their
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>relationship terminated in the course of carrying out the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>project. One of the women wrote:
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>IfIwas doing it over, I wouldn’t do it with a recent lover. But if I
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>hadn’t done it—l’d still do it. Advice: ... Make contingency
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>plans for members exiting and/or folding up the project. We
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>made them, and l’m glad we did.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Such plans offer some protection in a situation that is
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>inevitably traumatic.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Because the breakup of couples is disturbing to both in
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>siders and outsiders, it may be tempting to conclude that it
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>is a mistake for lovers to create an enterprise together. One
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>group member expressed the pain of what had happened to
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>her and her partner by advising, “Do not work with a
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>lover!” As understandable as this reaction may be, there
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>are (at least) two problems with this conclusion. The first is
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that when we take risks in love—or work—we do so for
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>what may be gained, not for what may be lost.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The more general issue is combining sexual relations
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with work relations. The decision to work with other
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women sooner or later involves issues of
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sexuality—whether women are heterosexual or lesbian.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>However a situation is initially defined, it can become
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>eroticized. Projects can heighten members’ attraction to
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>one another as well as defuse this kind of energy. Or groups
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>can repress sexuality. We were told about a well
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>established publication, almost all of whose members are
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lesbians, who have maintained an &quot;incest taboo. The
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>taboo was erected when they decided that sexuality within
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the workgroup was disruptive to the needs of the project.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>While their decision may or may not be unusual, it stems
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>from awareness that issues about sexual relations are
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>bound to arise when women work closely together.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The consequences of ignoring, acknowledging or dis-
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>couraging sexuality among co-workers is a topic we would
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>like to encourage women to discuss; its ramifications are
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>political as well as personal.

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>formed around shared interests in the enterprise. Prior per
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sonal relations were not key to women’s willingness to be
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>involved. Members began as colleagues, acquaintances or
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>virtual strangers.
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Very few of the members knew each other before work on the

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>impetus, and not knowing each other previously didn’t seem to
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>matter.

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>through other members of the group. ... Friendships had

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Such familiarity enabled women to assess one another
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>fairly quickly. Some groups which began this waj
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>developed successful projects without any change in the
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>initial founders. A women’s travel agency was created by
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>two travel agents:
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Mona and I met through a mutual friend who knew Mona was
				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>interested in starting a travel agency. We met, and two hours

				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>over during the first several months. This sorting-ous
				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>process meant that the women who remained felt con
				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>fident that they could work with the other women. The goal
				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was to establish the project, personal relations developed
				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>as it proceeded. That some groups did develop friendships
				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was mentioned but that was an outgrowth of working
				<lb facs='#facs_107_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>together, not a prerequisite. A literary anthology started off

				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tional groups included members in their 20’s within a larger age range. Three
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>groups were begun by women in their early 30’s, one enterprise was founded
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>by women in their early 40’s. Several projects contained younger women
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>(aged 16-19) as part of their workgroups. Only two projects mentioned women
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in their 50’s, one of whom was the sole proprietor of her store.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Half of the groups were made up of women relatively close in age (0-5 years
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>apart). The smaller the group, the greater the likelihood of being relatively
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>homogeneous in age.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Race (32) and Class Projects were begun by white women. Only six groups
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>mentioned nonwhite members; in each case there was one such woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>We did not include class in the revised questionnaire. A few groups who
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>had one or more working-class members raised the issue. Most group
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>members probably had middle-class origins.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Education (31) Founders were almost all college-educated. Twenty-seven
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>groups were made up entirely of women with at least “some college” and
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>many members had undergraduate degrees. Eleven of the projects contained
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>one or more members with graduate or professional degrees.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Four groups included women with only high school educations, but non
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>college women were in the minority in those projects.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Sexual Preference (32) Nearly half of the groups (15) included both gay
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and straight women. Sometimes these groups were predominantly hetero
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>sexual or homosexual; usually the proportion was more equal. Mixed groups
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tended to be medium- or large-sized: 12 had four or more members.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Twelve groups were started by lesbians. Nine were very small (2-3), and
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>these tended to involve lovers. Two of the larger projects were specifically
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>designed for lesbians. The other large project (13 members) was a bookstore.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Five groups included only heterosexuals. At the time the questionnaire was

				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>lesbians. Four of the five projects were very small.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Children (28) Enterprises were evenly divided on whether or not any
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>members had children. Small projects (2-4 members) seem a little more likely
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to be founded by nonmothers than by mothers: 11 of the 18 small groups were
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>started by women without children. Of the ten larger groups, seven included
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>mothers in the initial group
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Groups were somewhat homogeneous with respect to motherhood. Either
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>no one had children (14 projects) or everyone did (3). Eleven groups contained
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>both mothers and nonmothers. These varied from being mostly mothers to
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>mostly nonmothers.
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Home Situation (23) Usually, members of a group lived in relatively
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>similar circumstances, that is, their members were either living-together
				<lb facs='#facs_111_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>lovers, or were living with husbands and children, or were in “single” life-

				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>combined women with varying home situations. These projects were likely to

				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Sources of Financial Support at the Outset (31) For almost all projects,
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>members were financially independent of the enterprise they started. Only
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>four groups included women who were primarily dependent upon the project
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>for support. The majority of groups had at least some members who were
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>supported by full- or part-time jobs (outside the project), though other sources
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of economic maintenance were social services (unemployment, welfare, etc.),
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>husbands or lovers, savings and “personal wealth, and student-related
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>(scholarships, loans, parents, etc.) More than half of theprojects had members
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>who were relatively homogeneous with respect to source of financial support.
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>However, even when there appears to be heterogeneity, similar lifestyles may
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mute potentially visible economic differences.
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Previous Involvement in the Women’s Movement (34) A little over half of
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the founders had considerable or heavy prior feminist experience. They had
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>generally been active for at least two years in a variety of political groups, pro
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>jects and positions (organizers as well as members). The rest of the founders
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>had relatively little or no previous feminist involvement.
				<lb facs='#facs_112_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Seventy percent of the groups were composed of women who were homo

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>two factors which we may initially underestimate. First,

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The “technical mystique” that stands between us and our
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>goals is sometimes an illusion. Bookkeeping, for example,
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>mostly consists of classifying amounts into appropriate
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>income and expense groups, writing them neatly in
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>columns and adding up the columns. These tasks require
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>common sense, arithmetic and careful attention to detail,
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>all of which are abilities familiar to us, whether we have

				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>miliar abilities. After several such encounters, we can
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>begin to assume that many skills are within our reach—the
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>reflex “Tve never done that; I don’t know how!” becomes
				<lb facs='#facs_116_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>T’ve never done that; what does it involve?” One group

				<lb facs='#facs_129_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>2. Figure out how to use the time, capital and skills that
				<lb facs='#facs_129_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>are already available. Then deal with supplementing them.
				<lb facs='#facs_129_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>3. Anticipate burnout. Take seriously members’ health,

				<lb facs='#facs_129_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>6. Evaluate the project frequently. What changes are an
