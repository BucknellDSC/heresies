				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>(From Taped Conversation, October 21, 1982)
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>So what’s the point of a collective statement? What do we want it to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>say? (S.H.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Well, it’s not an individual statement. What I could do with another
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Black woman is totally different from what I can say in a collective state
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ment. (S.W.V.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The point of this is what we say to each other. Let’s talk about what
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>were our expectations when we joined the group. (M.S.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>When I arrived from Boston the Heresies Collective was working on the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Third World Women’s issue. That was apparently a very difficult issue and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the word that got back to me from Black feminists was the Heresies Collec
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tive is a group of racist white women. ... Then I read some of the issues and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>articles and I really liked the material. I had an article in the next issue,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and decided to come to a meeting for this one. I was really happy to see so
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>many different women. I know a lot of people from different countries, but
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>this was a chance to focus on women. This was so different. We put in so
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>much hard work. We tried to be so fair and listened to each other’s experi
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ences. Yet I am still shocked at the way white American women discuss
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>racism. So many of the manuscripts we got talked about white women and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sex with Black men. Sexual contact was always the starting point, which is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>not how I see racism at all. If we’re talking about feminism, we’re talking
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about women, so they’re only interacting with me, a Black woman, through
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>their sexual image of Black men. Perhaps this is one major barrier. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>think about white men at all when I think about white women. Fortunately
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>nobody here in the collective did that; it was just in the manuscripts. (C.G.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Part of the experience is the way the women in this collective looked at
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that material and reacted to it. (S.H.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Yeah, we were OK. (C.G.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>It wasn’t nearly as bad as I thought it would be, based on the stories I
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>had heard from other women of color about working with “those racist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>white girls at Heresies.” Not that both white girls and colored girls don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>have a lot of learning and growing to do. (H.G.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Being on the racism issue—it was an experience. Hearing these people
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>argue about something that’s so important when you usually don’t hear
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>about it. You may read about it, but you usually don’t hear other people
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>talking about it, unless you bring it up. (M.G.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Carole, you say now you can talk to white women? (V.B.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Not in general, only the women in this collective. (C.G.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>So you felt some need to make some kind of contact? Was it satisfied?
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>(V.B.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I don’t really like to make contact with white people. (C.G.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>But you came here. (V.B.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>I didn’t see the racism issue as just white people, but many women com
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ing from many backgrounds to discuss the subject. Like at work you can not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>discuss racism with white people. (C.G.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Has this experience changed your approach to white people? Affected
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>your attitudes in any way? (V.B.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>That’s hard to answer. I don’t want to dismiss our work. ... We needed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>to form a study group to define racism. Then, we would have had a common
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>language. I felt that one of the stories we published is a racist piece. To
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>refer to the West Indies as “bush” and to quote a Harlemite expressing
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>hatred of whites are negative symbols about Black people. The Nigerian
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>author, Chinua Achebe, has asked white authors to refrain from creating
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>more works like Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” in which Africans are de
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>graded. However, no one agreed with my interpretation of the piece. Had!
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>not solicited manuscripts from Alice Walker and other women, I would
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>have resigned from this collective on racism. Unconscious and conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>racist imagery hurts. (C.G.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>This short-term process might not produce anything. I see that in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>classrooms when I talk about racism. ... You might see a little bit of open
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ing up. (S.W.V.)
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>A little bit of opening up is a miracle. (M.S.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Here you had the Civil Rights Movement, you are always aware of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>years of struggle between Black and white. But in Latin America, particu
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>larly in Chile where I come from, racism is simply not discussed. So I had
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>never had the opportunity to think about racism in relation to my own ex
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>perience. It was a fantastic thing to think in those terms with Black and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>white women. My experience in this capital of the world is that whatever
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>art my Latin friends do, it’s ignored by the mainstream. It does not exist, or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>it’s “ethnic.” Which is why I got out the issue of ethnocentrism. And I
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>realized nobody in this collective shared this thing with me. I was disap
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>pointed that everybody said this issue is about racism and nobody was will
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ing to go to a more general, a more cultural and ideological issue. Nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was willing to go from the emotional level of personal experiences about
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>racism to the more philosophical level. ... So I adapted! (C.V.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I remember those early meetings being very exciting, when there were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Asian and other Latin women in the group too. A new experience for me
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>too. Before that I had worked on racism in a group of all-white feminists. I
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>think I was afraid, at first, of working with women of color on this issue but
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I decided I wanted to do it anyway. Afraid, I guess, that l’d unpeel new
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>horrible layers of my own racism. Instead this was a really wonderful ex
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>perience. I think l’ve become much more aware of racism. ...There are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>shortcomings in the issue, like the lack of input from Native American wom
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>en, but in general l’m proud of it. If racism is going to change, white people
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>will have to do something to make it change. I think what we did here will
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>be a tool for that change. What I discovered was just that simple step—that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>you don’t just say, “Oh it’s all so horrible,” but that you can do something
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>about it. (C.C.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Me too. Another thing I got out of the whole process was a deepened
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>sense of the complexity of racism in the U.S., how it’s affected by elements
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of class, education, degree of color, all that. And the intense ambivalence
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>even the most positive women of color have toward the kind of work we’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>been doing, and the psychological and historical roots of that ambivalence.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>(L.R.L.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Working together you see how people feel and see. A lot of times white
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>people aren’t aware that we’re being racist. We don’t really understand
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>how it’s understood. A lot of the racism that goes on is unintentional, un
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>conscious. It’s really important to work together to undo that. ...Misunder
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>standing only gets corrected when there’s a chance to understand. (S.H.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>l’ve had white women—friends—try to talk to me about racism and tell
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>me they just don’t know what to say about racism because they’re not in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>volved. I just couldn’t believe that. The problem doesn’t exist. (V.B.)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>That’s what I meant about Latin America. People are very ready to dis
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>cuss class struggle because class struggle is a term that comes from Euro
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>pean culture that everybody shares, so this is OK. But to go beyond that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>conception or even discuss the implications—like racism—it’s awkward
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The subject of the Indians in Chile was usually treated as a problem of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>class struggle, not a cultural or religious difference. We have to question to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>what extent we’ve been conditioned by all this miseducation we’ve re
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ceived. I worried about the narrowness of the experiences that were sub
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>mitted. Most of the articles in this issue are individualized, separated ex
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>periences—“I felt this, you felt that.” But we also have to put together our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>own experiences of racism with what’s going on in the world, to reach a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>more general concept of global racism. It’s the American situation. If this
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>collective were in Latin America, we would have arrived at a totally differ
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ent conclusion because we are marginal. We’re always aware of the global
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>situation because we have to be. (C.V.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>This issue of Heresies is on the situation of racism in the U.S. today. It
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>represents who we are and what we’re concerned with, and how far we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>could go. (M.S.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>We do need to put discussion on an intellectual plane at some point, bus
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>I do not necessarily agree that the word “ethnocentrism” for this country is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>on an intellectual plane. I still insist that for us here that’s a cop-out. When
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>you say how you are not chosen by the art world because it centers on
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>here, that puts another meaning on ethnocentrism which has nothing’to do
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>with racism. It does have to do with peripheral vision. I insist on calling
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>racism racism, a spade a spade (laughter). That’s what it is and you cannos
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>take it and water it down. l’m not saying that your relation to the word is a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>watering down for you, but this country has gone through so much shit, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>to come up with another name on top of the shit is to say it did not happen to

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>we must conquer and christen them
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and make them do the work in our mines.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>How?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Now!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>No. Consider
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>The Spanish rise from the dead. On the third day, they say, they rise from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>the dead. How can we fight and win? How can we do them in?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Is it true? Is it real? Is it tales they tell? Is it lies? Do they rise? Do they die?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Do they really die?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>How shall we know?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>What can we do?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>This is what we did. We carried the Spaniard Salcedo across a stream on
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>our shoulders and pretended to slip, pretended to slide. When we fell we
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pretended to drown and all the while we held him, held him down till he
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>drowned,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and we apologized humbly.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>And then we laid him down on the riverbank and lit a fire and kept a watch,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>by day, by night, we kept a watch and called on this spirit to return, to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>quicken, to animate him,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and we apologized humbly.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>And when he lay there still and dead we tore our hair, we broke our bowls,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>we cried our regret. We offered our lives, offered up the lives of two clumsy
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Indians who had so offended,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and we apologized humbly.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We apologized humbly while we watched, three days we watched and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>three days more. We apologized humbly while the flies lit on his eyes and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the sweet smell of the long dead filled the air.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>And then we knew. And the women pounded the largest pestles in the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>largest mortars, and the men hit the ends of their spears on the ground, the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sounds of gladness!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and we blew the conch to the four winds:
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>arm!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fight back!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>kill these destructive devils!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>We ought to kill all those treacherous bas
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tards!! You can’t turn your back on ’em. And
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>lazy! Never seen such lazy flesh.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Lie around and smoke their pipes and for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>nicate, that’s all they&apos;d do if we didn’t put the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>fear of God in ’em.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>And liars! Lie as soon as breathe! Now
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>they’re saying they’re dying off. Sick, they say.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Fear of hard work, more likely. Bah! They’re
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>not dying, they’re hiding out there in those
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>endless bloody thickets.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Got so you can’t make a decent profit out
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>here anymore. Why, thirty years ago you could
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>go out and bring in 100 Indians as easy as I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>reach for this glass of gin. And any amount of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>honest English men and women ready to put
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>their hands to anything and glad of a blanket
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and a crust. But now! I don’t know what the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>world’s coming to.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>l’ve made up my mind! l’m going to Kingsport this week and buy me
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>some of those Africans. Sure it’Il cost me money. But I tell you, with the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>price of sugar the way it is l’m losing money letting that land lie idle. No,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>blacks it is. Hah! They’ll have a time trying to find where to hide out here!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Hah! And no pesky Englishmen’s rights to this and rights to that, blast ’em!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>See a mile away, too. Ha ha ha! Yehss. Sugar’s got a good price now
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>hmmmm; a good price.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>And the merchants perched on the coast of Africa and cast into its
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>depths and fished out, plucked out, pulled in, black skin after black skin
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>after black skin, and chained and branded and caged and shipped and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>whipped, and raped, pulled them into shape to be slaves, to do the unfree
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>labor a free society requires.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>And first by the hundreds and next by the thousands and then faster
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>and faster until millions were pushed and pulled out of Africa and those
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>who weren’t killed in capture or whipped dead or jumped overboard or
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>died in transit, those that were left—were left—in a thousand places in a

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>had told me about black people (who l’m sure
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>we called “Negro” or “colored”). That my old
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>great-aunts were afraid of them when they

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the windows. So I looked at these children
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The boy was serious and spoke to no one
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and I realized after a session or two that he was

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>friendly and slightly overweight like me. I de

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I was excited getting into the car that day.

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>me. “Could I invite her to our house?” I realized
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_11_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that my mother, staring ahead like stone, was

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the cultural life of Mexico. She taught Italian lit

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the feminist magazine FEM; and she had a great

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I saw her...I believe it was in November 1980.

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the problems of Guatemala. She told me she was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>going to make a trip back to see her mother, who
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>is very old, and when she came back she planned

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that she had disappeared! She had been going

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the jail, to try to see what has happened, see if
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>they can be of any use, they are told that this
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>person is not in jail, has not been arrested. They
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>can go all over the country, looking everywhere,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>going from authority to authority, and they are
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>frequently told, “No, we don’t have this person,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>he or she was probably taken by the Death
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Squads...
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>And what are these “Death Squads&quot;?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>The Death Squads are a phantom organization,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>not at all independent from the government. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>obvious that they are in agreement with the gov
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>ernment and act with its permission, since they
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>can operate freely on the streets even during cur
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>few hours. During the state of siege in one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>regimes, for instance, the number of Death Squad
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>victims rose to unheard-of levels, in spite of the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>fact that anyone circulating in the streets after
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>the curfew began was shot on sight by the army
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>and police. Another detail is that when they first
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>appeared, they distributed leaflets announcing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>their formation and making their threats from
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>planes which took off from and landed on an
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>army strip!
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Does the government acknowledge its link with
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the Death Squads?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Of course not. The Squads are just a way for the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>police or the army to deny all responsibility, not
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to have to acknowledge that a person has in fact
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>been arrested. This eliminates the recourse of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>habeas corpus; there is no trial; there is no sen
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tence. There is execution, because with great
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>frequency the bodies turn up in two or three days
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to a week. Quite often they have notes pinned or
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>them saying, “This was an execution by such and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>such Death Squad.” People turn up badly tor
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tured. They obviously suffered terribly before
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>they died. So when I heard that Alaide had dis
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>appeared in these circumstances in Guatemala,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was tremendously worried. I thought, my God, if
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>she doesn’t show up in a matter of days, that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>means she is dead.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Why did they pick Alaide?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Well, there are a number of possible reasons.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Alaide was living in exile in Mexico. She had left
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Guatemala in 1954, when the famous coup over
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>threw the Arbenz government; it was engineered,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as we all know, by the CIA. I mean the CIA says
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>this quite frankly. They are not ashamed of it at
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>all. They are happy and proud of it. The country
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>was then taken over by forces which wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>undo everything the Arbenz government had
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>even begun to do, like a very timid land reform.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>They just rolled time back. There was a lot of re
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pression and many people left the country. They
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>did well to leave because a lot of people lost their
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>lives in that period.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>She had been active in the Arbenz government?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>No, actually she wasn’t, though I believe her hus
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>band had a position. But she had written about
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the situation in Guatemala. On her radio program
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>she had interviewed three Guatemalan Indian
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>women from the Quiché who were members of a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>peasant self-defense league—the CUC, or Com
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>mittee for Peasant Unity. They were traveling
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>through Mexico hoping to stir up public opinion
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>about what was happening to their country.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>When did this interview take place?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Two months before her disappearance, but
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Alaide hadn’t put it on the air yet. She was hold
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>ing it until she came back. She was not taking un
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>necessary risks, you know. And what else was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>she doing? Well, she directed FEM, a feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>magazine which was not this antiseptic feminism;
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>it was a politically conscious magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>I understand Alaide had a humanist position
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>within the feminist movement. Very politically
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>aware, but not what people call a “radical.” Is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>this so?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Alaide was somebody who would try to see what
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was going on. She was certainly a far cry from
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dogmatism of any type, feminist or political or
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I remember reading articles in which she said
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that feminism was a cultural revolution, that fem
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>inism could not be a sect of sexists but had to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>change the consciousness of men and women in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>order to transform society as a whole.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Oh yes. She was a writer and a thinker, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>would not easily fall for a shallow definition of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>feminism, or for a shallow definition of social
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>change. She would want something much more
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ample, necessarily.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>How old was she when she disappeared?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Sixty-five.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Did the government of Guatemala ever acknowl
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>edge her disappearance?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>That kind of government simply tries to disguise
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the truth. They lie, and they believe this lie has a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>chance of being believed. The first thing they
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>said was that she was kidnapped by the guerril
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>las! And the guerrillas obviously had nothing to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>do with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>How do you know?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The guerrillas immediately declared they had
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>absolutely nothing to do with it. They had no mo-
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tive. No ransom was ever demanded. This makes
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>it clear that it was not a kidnapping by a leftist
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>group. So there is only one option... When you
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>get three to ten to twenty people disappearing a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>day, and 99% of them have been taken by the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Death Squads, you know, there is no question
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>about it. And there is one more detail to corrobo
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>rate the guilt of the government: Shortly before
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Alaide went to Guatemala, her brother-in-law,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>who was a Minister of Economics in the Guate-
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>malan government at the time, telephoned her in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Mexico, and warned her not to come. This means
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that somebody else in the government, knowing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that he was Alaide’s brother-in-law, was friendly
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>enough to tell him to tell her not to come because
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>she would be killed.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Why did she go?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Her mother is very, very old. Alaide probably
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>thought, “When I return to Mexico, if I start a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>campaign to make the public aware of what is

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N007'/>ber of public protests were planned in Mexico to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N008'/>again demand that the government present Alaide
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N009'/>Foppa. If you have her, where is she? We want to

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N011'/>want a trial. And the government said she had
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N012'/>died in an armed encounter with the guerrillas!
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N013'/>That’s what they said! To begin with, a woman 65
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N014'/>years old joining the guerrillas when she had
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N015'/>plans to go back and fight to make the problem
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N016'/>known...
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N017'/>Were there protests in Guatemala as well
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N018'/>I doubt there have been because in that country
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N019'/>there’s no such thing. It is impossible. Anybody
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N020'/>who tries to protest is murdered. That’s it. The
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N021'/>government respects nothing. They kill Christian
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N022'/>Democrats.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N023'/>I wanted to ask you about Alaide’s background. I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N024'/>understand she came from a very wealthy family,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N025'/>and in spite of this, she took the side of the Indian.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N026'/>Yes, her family had a coffee plantation, I believe
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N027'/>Alaide undoubtedly had Indian nannies taking
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N028'/>care of her; she had little Indian playmates wher
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N029'/>she was a kid. She certainly would know what
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N030'/>was happening on the plantation, and a child
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N031'/>who is sensitive or perceptive is likely to learn
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N032'/>more from what she sees around her than fron
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N033'/>what she is told. Quite frequently children wil
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N034'/>not share their parents’ points of view, or their
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N035'/>prejudices....Growing up as a student, she
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N036'/>would know the situation. You can be an aloof
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N037'/>intellectual or you can have a wider perception
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N038'/>of reality, which is obviously what she had. She
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N039'/>would certainly have been concerned with the

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N015'/>dians in the guerrilla struggle. Can you tell us
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N016'/>more about it?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N017'/>I would say in 1980 and 1981 it started up again
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N018'/>among the Indians, because they are losing their
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N019'/>land, and they are being murdered to the point of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N020'/>genocide. Homes, villages are being wiped out.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N021'/>When the Indian (most peasants are Indians)
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N022'/>sees his or her father, family members, friends
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N023'/>being murdered in cold blood, he or she comes to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N024'/>the conclusion it would be better to pick up arms
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N025'/>than to stand and wait to be murdered as well.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N026'/>And that is why you have such a strong renewal
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N027'/>of the guerrilla movement and why you have men
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N028'/>and women together. Because there is no salva
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N029'/>tion. There is no option. They either fight or they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N030'/>are probably going to die.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N031'/>Soledad Cano, in her book La Noche del Colibrí,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N032'/>Arde Centroamerica, says that the multinational
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N033'/>corporations are very interested in grabbing the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N034'/>Indian land because nickel and petroleum have
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N035'/>been discovered there. Can you tell us how they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N036'/>are doing it?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N037'/>Yes, they connive with the army to take all the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N038'/>Indians away from their ancestral land, and they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N039'/>do it by all kinds of legalistic tricks. The Indians
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N040'/>don’t have “titles of property” to the land they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N041'/>inherited from their ancestors! So they just take
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N042'/>their livelihood away, leaving them no other re
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N043'/>source. They opened up a new highway which
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N044'/>connects this land with the outside world, and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N045'/>this makes the value of the land go up to strato
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N046'/>spheric levels. There is also the fact that many
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N047'/>officers in the army have taken advantage of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N048'/>their position in the government and they have
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_37' n='N049'/>bought up the land, and now they have a double
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N050'/>interest in maintaining the status quo because
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N051'/>now they are landowners, they are capitalists.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N052'/>Many people think the Indians are only a small
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_41' n='N053'/>group of people, but isn’t it true that they are
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N054'/>more than half of the population of Guatemala?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N055'/>Of course. I would say that the white or ladino
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N056'/>the criollo population is a minority. The very
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N057'/>vast majority is Indian. The “owners” may be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N058'/>white, but everybody who works for them is defi
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N059'/>nitely Indian

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>How do you see the prospects for the future in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Guatemala!
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Well, frankly I think they will keep fighting. I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>think they cannot help but keep fighting. At pres
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ent the government can carry on this warfare at
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tremendously repressive levels, wipe out entire
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>populations. They have the arms; they have the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>airplanes and all kinds of technology; they have
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>computerized communications systems all over
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the country, so that they are perfectly capable of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>fighting the barely armed, barely fed guerrilla
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>groups. However, as we have seen in other cases,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>in countries like Vietnam, when the population is
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that desperate, that decided, they just have to kill
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>them all, and they will have to kill them all in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Guatemala. There comes a point when it is no
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>longer possible, when the armed forces them
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>selves are not willing to go on, when they turn.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>There could come a change within the army, but
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>don’t believe they are flexible enough. I don’t be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lieve the upper classes in Guatemala are ready to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>give up anything at all.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>What about elections, can they change anything?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Well, as in Salvador, the supposedly democratic
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>elections are nothing but an incredible farce. You
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>don’t even have what they call “the center.” You
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>have nothing except the right and the far right. In
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the most recent elections what happened is that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the far right claimed there had been a fraud; they
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>marched in the streets and said the army&apos;s candi
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>date, who had won, had been forced in by the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>army. I believe this is what is behind the recent
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>coup. That the army saw these people marching
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in the streets, their photographs in the interna
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>tional press, and a society woman being hit on
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the face with a gun by a soldier was bad public
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>relations internationally. It was a very funny
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>coup, because it was part of the army against the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>government in power, which was the army as
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>well. There was no fighting, no opposition, noth-
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ing. Now, I can understand a coup by generals
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>against a civilian government not encountering
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>opposition, but a coup by officials against the mil
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>itary government, and no resistance? I think there
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>was perfect agreement before this coup hap
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>pened. The same people are still in power.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>And has the situation in the country changed
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>since the coup?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Since the coup the Death Squad murders have
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>continued and even increased. Not only has noth
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>ing changed, the situation has actually gotten
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>worse, and even high functionaries of the last
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>government who were considered to be relatively
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>decent are leaving the country. Among them, by
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the way, Alaide’s brother-in-law.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Iunderstand that the Carter government did cut
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>military aid to Guatemala because of Human
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Rights violations, and Carter was accused by the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Guatemalan right wing of being a communist!
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Yes, this is why a very important group of Guate
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>malan businessmen gave Reagan a lot of money
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>for his campaign, and had an understanding with
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>him. Reagan is obviously paying them back for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>this, saying yes, we are going to try to renew mili-
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>tary aid, saying they have a different government
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>now, and things are going to change, like in Sal
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>vador. They say we just had an election, there
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>are now civilian men in the government, we must
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>continue military aid....
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>What do you think the people of the United States
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>can do to help the people of Guatemala?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>Ah, very clearly what the American people can
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>do is to write to their Congressmen and their Sen
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_11_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>ators and tell them we do not want American mil

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N028'/>the pain in which we see our people. The CUC is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N029'/>mainly a committee of peasants in which the ma

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N031'/>are also a few poor ladinos with us, so that all of

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_4' n='N037'/>She says that she began not very long ago, only
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_5' n='N038'/>one year. She says her participation is with the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_6' n='N039'/>people, giving testimony, and that she is going
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_7' n='N040'/>to keep on giving testimony to all the suffering
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_8' n='N041'/>they have endured in the Quiché province.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_9' n='N042'/>She could hardly have begun any earlier. Have
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_10' n='N043'/>there been victims in your families!
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_11' n='N044'/>Yes, we have had victims, yes, in the family
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_12' n='N045'/>cousins, nephews, even brothers have fallen.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_13' n='N046'/>Do your parents agree with your participation?
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_14' n='N047'/>They agree. We have learned primarily from
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_15' n='N048'/>them, because they grew up as good catequistas
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_16' n='N049'/>and that’s where the repression began, against
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_17' n='N050'/>all Guatemalan Christians. Then we began to or
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_18' n='N051'/>ganize ourselves, to search for other solutions
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_19' n='N052'/>with which to defend ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_20' n='N053'/>In the province of Quiché, the Catholic Church
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_21' n='N054'/>has been particularly repressed, so much so that
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_22' n='N055'/>the bishop was obliged to close the churches anc
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_23' n='N056'/>leave, since, as Guadalupe just said, the catequis
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_24' n='N057'/>tas were the best educated. They were also the

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_14_1_tl_29' n='N062'/>Principally to the people of Mexico and to the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>our problems. In our provinces we need many
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>things; we need money, help, aid from abroad;
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>we need medicine, everything. Recently, the as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sassin Lucas will not permit the peasants to buy
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>medicine, not in Quiché or in other provinces, es
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pecially in the faraway communities up in the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>mountains. He wants the Indians to die, to die of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>disease or hunger, so in the face of this, we have
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to find aid, economic assistance, or other things
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_13_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>which can help us.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_1' n='N011'/>I think this request of Guadalupe’s is heard by
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_2' n='N012'/>many, and whoever wishes to contribute assist
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_3' n='N013'/>ance can contact Radio University.... What has
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_4' n='N014'/>the CUC done about the lack of food? What influ
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_5' n='N015'/>ence has the repression had, or the struggle, on
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_6' n='N016'/>the harvests in the fields?
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_7' n='N017'/>Now and since the struggle began, the most
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_8' n='N018'/>pressing problem is getting fair wages, as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_9' n='N019'/>equality and good treatment on the job. Now the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_10' n='N020'/>CUC has gained a wage of three quetzals and 20
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_11' n='N021'/>cents.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_12' n='N022'/>The quetzal is equivalent to a dollar, so this
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_13' n='N023'/>triumph represents a very low salary. I would
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_14' n='N024'/>like for you to speak for a moment about what
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_15' n='N025'/>you gained in the great strike in which the CUC
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_16' n='N026'/>participated.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_17' n='N027'/>In April of this year [1980) on the Southern Coast
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_18' n='N028'/>of Guatemala, some 4,000 peasants participated
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_19' n='N029'/>with us in demanding this wage. Many of them
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_20' n='N030'/>were assassinated, kidnapped and threatened.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_21' n='N031'/>But we succeeded in obtaining the minimum
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_22' n='N032'/>wage.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_23' n='N033'/>How much did you earn before?
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_24' n='N034'/>We earned one quetzal.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_25' n='N035'/>How long did the strike last?
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_26' n='N036'/>It lasted a month or more.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_27' n='N037'/>How did women participate in this movement?
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_28' n='N038'/>We participated equally with men, as we do not
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_15_1_tl_29' n='N039'/>have a division between men and women, be

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>in this strike we all participate, reclaiming our
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>rights and our just wages by means of demon
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>strations, strikes, taking over the streets, and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>quite a bit of activity such as stopping buses.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>Did the number of participants grow during the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>course of the month?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>Yes, when we began, the number of participants
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>was not so great, nor was the support, because it
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>was the first concrete action we took.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>That is to say, the first action organized by the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>CUC, by the peasant people, by the masses of
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>men, women, and children, a truly mass move
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>ment. Was the repression very great?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>Yes, the government sent troups of soldiers fron
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>the army to kill all these peasants. Thus the CUC
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>is an organization that deals with means of de
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>fense and security, to defend ourselves against
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>the enemy...
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>You mean that there are not only verbally ex
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>pressed demands, but also self-defense? In what
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>form?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>Well, for example, we work mostly in sabotage,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>scattering small tacks in the road, making ditches
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>or tunnels, or destroying bridges so that it is not
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>so easy for the enemy to advance. We also defend
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>ourselves with our machetes and everything we
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>have at hand.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>How or in what way do peasant groups, or more
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>concretely, the CUC, feel supported by the armed
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>struggle, or in what way do you feel you are help
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>ing the guerrillas from your position?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>As an organization we feel it by means of the ac
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>tions they have done. They have also done sabo
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>tage. When there are armed encounters, the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>enemy pays attention to them and leaves us in
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>peace. Also, the distribution of pamphlets by the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>guerrillas helps us in that we can feel as brothers
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>in the struggle. It is not only we who suffer and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>struggle. If the enemy does not sleep, we don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>sleep either.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Yes, that we have, but we don’t have the con
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>crete means to defend ourselves or to attack the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>enemy.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N004'/>The other day we spoke of the harvests which
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N005'/>have been undoubtedly jeopardized by the pres
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N006'/>ence of the war. Are there places in which you
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N007'/>have been obliged to abandon your lands?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N008'/>Yes, principally the compañeros of the provinces
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N009'/>of Quiché, Nevajos, Pantano, where the repres
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N010'/>sion has reached a certain point of intensity.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N011'/>Many times, only because they are catequistas,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N012'/>the Christians have had to leave, although they
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N013'/>are not yet organized. Then we saw the necessity
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N014'/>to organize ourselves in many hamlets; many
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N015'/>have left their families, their houses, or have
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N016'/>brought their families to wander in other prov
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N017'/>inces, because they cannot live there at home.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N018'/>Even though there are ways of defense, even
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N019'/>though there is unity on the part of the peasants,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N020'/>we do not have arms the way the enemy does, so
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N021'/>we don’t show as much bravery in defending
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N022'/>ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N023'/>Bravery you do not lack.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N024'/>And in Quiché are there landowners? Are Indi
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N025'/>ans the owners of their own land? As a group or
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N026'/>as individuals?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N027'/>Well, now they say all the land belongs to Lucas,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N028'/>right? Yet we live not only in Quiché, but in the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N029'/>greater part of this country. We live on the land,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N030'/>yet we have to travel to Inta for Lucas to give us
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N031'/>the land and for them to give us a piece of paper.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N032'/>You have gone to protest; have you had some
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N033'/>success?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N034'/>Yes, we have, because there are many farmers
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N035'/>who wanted to throw us out of our lands in the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N036'/>Quiché province; the young ones, principally In
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N037'/>dians who cannot speak Spanish and who no one
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N038'/>listens to, they take them away and then the land
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N039'/>is the farmers’. But confronted by the unity of the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N040'/>peasants and through our tactics of self-defense
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N041'/>and our sense of security, we have succeeded so
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N042'/>that the farmers are no longer encouraged to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N043'/>enter our lands. Before, the army arrived and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N044'/>entered houses and carried off eggs and money
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N045'/>and anything else they could find. But now if they
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N046'/>still do these things, we are able to fight up to a
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N047'/>certain point, until nothing more can be done. As
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N048'/>long as we can defend ourselves, with everything
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N049'/>that we have at hand, we will fight so that it
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N050'/>won’t be so easy for them.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N051'/>Is the resistance growing?
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N052'/>Yes.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N053'/>This is very important and you are conscious of
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N054'/>it, and it gives you courage to go ahead. I would

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N057'/>She says that she has participated in almost
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N058'/>every means of self-defense; principally she has
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N059'/>been on sentry duty, when they must watch for
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N060'/>each other, in order that some may rest.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>You mean they use the medieval system—hot
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>water that women can throw on the army? Did

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Yes, she was to occupy them for whatever time
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>she could, so that the compañeros could retreat,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>or take up other means of defense.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>We have to realize that it is not Maria alone.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that the army has killed between 2,000 and 5,000
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>people since March. Entire villages have been

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Women stood three-deep around the bar and between the tables, and in

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>front room, or doing a slow fish on the dance floor in the back, with the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>smells of cigarette smoke and the music and the hair pomade whirling
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>together like incense through charged air, it was hard for me to believe that

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>But when I, a Black woman, saw no reflection in any of the faces there

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and eddies of the larger society that had spawned it, and which allowed the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Bagatelle to survive as long as it did, selling watered-down drinks at
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>inflated prices to lonely dykes who had no other social outlet or community
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>gathering place.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Rather than the idyllic picture created by false nostalgia, the fifties
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>were really straight white america’s cooling-off period of “let’s pretend
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>we’re happy and that this is the best of all possible worlds and we’ll blow

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>by the fashion conflicts between the blue-jeans set and the Bermuda-shorts
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>set. Then, of course, there were those who fell in between, both by virtue of

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The breakdown into the mommies and daddies was an important part of
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lesbian relationships in the Bagatelle. If you asked the wrong woman to
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>dance, you could get your nose broken in the alley down the street by her
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>butch, who had followed you out of the Bag for exactly that purpose. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>safer to keep to yourself. And you were never supposed to ask who was
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>who, which is why there was such heavy emphasis on corrèct garb. The
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>well-dressed gay-girl was supposed to give you enough clues for you to

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>For some of us, however, the role-playing reflected all the depreciating
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>attitudes toward women which we loathed in straight society. It was e
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>rejection of these roles that had drawn us to “the life” in the first place
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Instinctively, without particular theory or political position or dialectic, we
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>recognized oppression as oppression, no matter where it came from.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>But those lesbians who had carved some niche in the pretend world of
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>dominance/subordination rejected what they called our “confused” life
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>style, and they were in the majority.

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>its table, but at Laurel’s on Sunday afternoon there was free brunch with
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>any drink, and that meant all you could eat. Many of the gay bars used this
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>to get Sunday afternoon business at a traditionally slow time, but Laurel’s
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>had the best food. There was a Chinese cook there of no mean talent. He
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>cooked back and kept it coming. After the word got around, every Sunday
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>afternoon at four o’clock there would be a line of gay-girls in front of

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>there at that time by accident.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>When the doors opened, there was a discreet but determined stampede,

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Colony and the Pony Stable Inn. Each closed after a year or so, while
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>another opened and caught on somewhere else. But for that year, Laurel’s
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>served as an important place for those of us who met and made some brief
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>space for ourselves there. It had a feeling of family
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>On summer Sunday afternoons, Muriel and I would split from the gay
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>beach at Coney Island or Riis Park early, take the subway back home in
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>time to wash up and dress and saunter over to Laurel’s in time for the food
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>at 4:00. I had my first open color confrontation with a gay-girl one Sunday
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>afternoon in Laurel’s.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Muriel and I had come back that day from Riis Park, full of sun and
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sand. We loved with the salt still on our skins, then bathed, washed our
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>hair, and got ready to go out. I put on my faded cord riding britches with
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the suede crotch, and a pale blue short-sleeved sweatshirt bought earlier
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that week at John’s on Avenue C for sixty-nine cents. My skin was tanned
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>from the sun and burnished ruddy with the heat and much loving. My hair
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>was newly trimmed and freshly washed, with the particular crispiness that
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>it always develops in sustained summer heat. I felt raunchy and restless.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>We walked out of the hot August afternoon sun into the suddenly dark
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>coolness of Laurel’s downstairs. There was Muriel, in her black Bermuda
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>shorts and shirt, ghost pale, her eternal cigarette in hand. And I was beside
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>her, full of myself, knowing I was fat and Black and very fine. We were
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>without peer or category, and on that day I was conscious of being very
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>proud of it, no matter who looked down her nose at us
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>After Muriel and I had gotten our food and beer and copped one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>tables, Dottie and Pauli came over. We saw them a lot at the Bag and in the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>supermarket over on Avenue D, but we’d never been to their house nor they
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>to ours, except for New Year’s food, when everyone came.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>“Where you guys been?” Pauli had an ingenuous smile, her blonde hair
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>and blue eyes incandescent against the turquoise mandarin shirt she wore.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>“Riis. Gay Beach.” Muriel’s finger crooked over the bottle as she took a
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>slug. All of us eschewed glasses as faggy, although I sometimes longed for
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>one because the cold beer hurt my teeth.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Pauli turned to me. “Hey, that’s a great tan you have there. I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>know Negroes got tans.” Her broad smile was intended to announce the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>remark as ajoke
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>My usual defense in such situations was to ignore the overtones, to let it
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>go. But Dottie Daws, probably out of her own nervousness at Pauli’s refer-
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>ence to the unmentionable, would not let the matter drop. Raved on and on
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>about my great tan. Matched her arm to mine. Shook her pale blonde head
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>telling whomever would listen that she wished she could tan like that
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>instead of burning, and did I know how lucky I was to be able to get such a
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>tan like that? I grew tired and then shakingly furious, having enough of
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>whatever it was.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>&quot;How come you never make so much over my natural tan most days,
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>Dottie Daws; how come!
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>There was a moment of silence at the table, punctuated only by Muriel’s
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>darkly appreciative chuckle, and then we moved on to something else,

			<pb n='18'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>mercifully. I was still shaking inside. I never forgot it.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>In the gay bars, I longed for other Black women without the need ever
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>taking shape on my lips. For four hundred years in this country, Black
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women have been taught to view each other with deep suspicion. It was no
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>different in the gay world.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Most Black lesbians were closeted, correctly recognizing the Black com
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>munity’s lack of interest in our position, as well as the many more immedi
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ate threats to our survival as Black people in a racist society. It was hard
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>enough to be Black, to be Black and female, to be Black, female, and gay.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>To be Black, female, gay, and out of the closet, even to the extent of danc
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing in the Bagatelle, was considered by many Black lesbians to be simply
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>suicidal. And if you were fool enough to do it, you’d better come on so tough
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that nobody messed with you. I often felt put down by their sophistication,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>their clothes, their manners, their cars, and their femmes.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The Black women I usually saw around the Bag were into heavy roles,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and it frightened me. This was partly the fear of my own Blackness mir
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>rored, and partly the realities of the masquerade. These women felt to me
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>like parts of my own sexual self I had not yet come to terms with. They
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>seemed tough in a way I felt I could never be. Even if they were not, their
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>self-protective instincts warned them to appear that way. By white ameri
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ca’s racist distortions of beauty, Black women playing “femme” had very
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>little chance in the Bag. There was constant competition among butches to
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>have the most “gorgeous femme” on their arm. And “gorgeous” was de
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fined by a white male world’s standards.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>For me, going into the Bag was like entering an anomalous no-woman’s
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>land. I wasn’t cute or passive enough to be “femme, and I wasn’t mean or
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tough enough to be “butch.” I was given a wide berth. Nonconventional
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>people can be dangerous, even in the gay community.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>With the exception of Felicia and myself, the other Black women in the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Bag came protected by a show of all the power symbols they could muster.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Whatever else they did during the week, on Friday nights when Lion or
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Trip appeared, sometimes with expensively dressed women on their arms,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sometimes alone, they commanded attention and admiration. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>well-heeled, superbly dressed, self-controlled high-steppers who drove
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>convertibles, bought rounds of drinks for their friends, and generally took
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>care of business.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>But sometimes, even they couldn’t get in unless they were recognized by
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the bouncer.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>My friends and I were the hippies of the gay-girl circuit, before the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>word was coined. Many of us wound up dead or demented, and many of us
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>were distorted by the many fronts we had to fight upon. But when we sur-
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>vived, we grew up strong.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Every Black woman I ever met in the Village in those years had some
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>part in my survival, large or small, if only as a figure in the head-count at
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the Bag on a Friday night.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Black lesbians in the Bagatelle faced a world only slightly less hostile
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>than the outer world which we had to deal with every day on the outside—
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that world which defined us as doubly nothing because we were Black and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>because we were Women—that world which raised our blood pressures
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and shaped our furies and our nightmares.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>wholesale return of the american woman to the role of little wifey. So far as
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I could see, gay-girls were the only Black and white women who were even
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>talking to each other in this country in the 1950s, outside of the empty
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>rhetoric of patriotism and political movements.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Black or white, Ky-Ky, butch, or femme, the only thing we shared, often,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and in varying proportions, was that we dared for connection in the name
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of woman, and saw that as our power, rather than our problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>All of us who survived those common years had to be a little strange.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We spent so much of our young womanhood trying to define ourselves as
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>woman-identified women before we even knew the words existed, let alone
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>that there were ears interested in trying to hear them beyond our im
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>mediate borders. All of us who survived those common years have to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>little proud. A lot proud. Keeping ourselves together and on our own tracks,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>however wobbly, was like trying to play the Dinizulu War Chant or a Beet-
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>hoven sonata on a tin dog-whistle.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The important message seemed to be that you had to have a place.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Whether or not it did justice to whatever you felt you were about, there had
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to be some place to refuel and check your flaps.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In times of need and great instability, the place sometimes became more
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>a definition than the substance of why you needed it to begin with. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>times the retreat became the reality. The writers who posed in cafes
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>talking their work to death without writing two words; the lesbians, virile
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as men, hating women and their own womanhood with a vengeance. The
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>bars and the coffee shops and the streets of the Village in the 1950s were
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>full of nonconformists who were deathly afraid of going against their
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>hard-won group, and so eventually they were broken between the group
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and their individual needs.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>For some of us there was no one particular place, and we grabbed
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>whatever we could from wherever we found space, comfort, quiet, a smile,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>nonjudgment.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Being women together was not enough. We were different. Being gay-

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>not enough. We were different. Being Black women together was not

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>We were different.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Each of us had our own needs and pursuits, and many different alli

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tle for one easy definition, one narrow individuation of self. At the Bag, at

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>It was a while before we came to realize that our place was the very

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>we learned that fear does not have to incapacitate, and that we could

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>When I was a little girl I liked to put a feather in my hair and say to the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>other children in the neighborhood: “Can you imagine what we’d be doing if
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the Spaniards hadn’t come here? Dressed or naked, we would be jumping
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>from rock to rock, swift as arrows after a small bird, or quiet and absorbed
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>in the perfume of fruit, we would be listening to the sound of waterfalls

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>But in the neighborhood where I lived, the Sunday movies annulled my
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>work of persuasion: the cowboy and Indian films imposed prestige of the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>opposite version. The Indians appeared defeated and impoverished, so who

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>abyss, on a building top, was the main test. I liked the image of heroism in
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>battle, until I began to read and discovered that I liked the image in pre
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Columbian mythology, Shakespeare, and Homer better than fighting.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I became a writer and discovered that I had chosen a double symbol: the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>feather was both my race and my form of doing battle.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N008'/>From the start I understood art and poetry as a form of transgression: I had
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N009'/>no intention of accepting the role assigned to me. My family had a long
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N010'/>European cultural tradition, but the advice of the women sculptors saved
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N011'/>me time. Aunt Rosa had learned from the old Indian pottery-makers tech
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N012'/>niques she later applied in her ceramic sculpture.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N013'/>My first works were an emblem or declaration. A joyful challenge nurtured
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N014'/>them: the primal impulse to make an offering, and a conscious desire not
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N015'/>to repeat what already existed.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N016'/>As I wrote poetry, I instinctively followed my inner voice. I would notice a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N017'/>tension at the nape of my neck—proof of a clear, sustained listening. The
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N018'/>density of the texts produced this way differentiated them from my other
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N019'/>verbal constructions. I surely had at the back of my mind the images and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N020'/>metaphors of Guarani literature. The spiritual and concrete eroticism of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N021'/>their body-song:
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N022'/>The divine soles of the feet,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N023'/>their little round seats....
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_17' n='N024'/>The divine palms of the hands
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_18' n='N025'/>with their flowering branches.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_19' n='N026'/>And the incorporation of this vision into their laws: “Whoever, out of lack
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_20' n='N027'/>of love for his neighbor’s beautiful body, sets fire to their house shall suffer
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_10_1_tl_21' n='N028'/>the same punishment. Only this way will there be justice.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N029'/>Poetry, as the essential life-transforming experience, led me to search for
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N030'/>different ways to extend its effectiveness. And the silence in poetry, that
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N031'/>which could not be expressed in words, drew me to art.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N032'/>I began to paint, and painting led me to sculpture...a process that began
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N033'/>in 1963 and culminated in 1966, when I found myself gathering debris on
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N034'/>the beach. The stones, sticks, and feathers I found as I walked, and the sun
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N035'/>above me, called out for a form. The sticks asked for a specific tieing, the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N036'/>stones for a specific placement. I had to listen and obey. The same tension,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_9' n='N037'/>vibrating at the nape of my neck, would occur as I listened. The paths of the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N038'/>mind I explored, looking for the precise positioning, led me to an ancient
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N039'/>silence, waiting to be heard.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N040'/>These fragile constructions on the beach, which high tide would carry
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N041'/>away, were the symbols of an inner rite.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N042'/>In 1966 I called this work “arte precario,” from its propensity to disappear.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_15' n='N043'/>Years later I discovered that precario comes from the Latin precis, prayer,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N044'/>and from precarius, what is obtained through prayer.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_11_1_tl_17' n='N045'/>Iunderstood this work as a way of remembering, of recovering a language;

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_12_1_tl_1' n='N047'/>All along, the obverse of this silent work was my collective experience with

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>In 1972 I signed a contract with the University Press of Valparaiso for my

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It took me years to understand the silencing of these works. Autumn and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the precarious sculpture had been pioneer events. (Experimental art forms
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>began in Chile much later. In 1971 the scene was dominated by political
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>art—“political” in content, but formally derivative.) And my poetry was
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>not like anyone else’s, so who could notice it?
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I left Chile for London in 1972, to do post-graduate work, and was caught
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>there by the military coup in 1973. There was no time for thinking about the
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>supression of art when the anti-fascist movement demanded an active con
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cern with the human and political problems of the day. .. Eventually reflec
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tion on the failure to secure the democratic process began and I questioned
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the effectiveness of my previous work. As a result I adopted the prevailing
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>view that our struggle had room only for the most immediate calls to rebel. I
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>forgot the double symbol I had chosen; the poetry of self-discovery I had
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>produced until then.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Ireturned to Latin America in 1975—not to Chile, but to Colombia. Encoun
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tering the mountains of Bogotá, the smell of the land, the color and bones of
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the people, made me feel again my Indian ancestry. But the feeling did not
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>become awareness until the Guambiano tribal cooperative invited me to
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Cauca to give an art workshop. Being with them taught me that the Latin
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Amerian struggle for independence cannot be fought exclusively with Euro
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>pean ideologies, which are derived from the same ethnocentric world view
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that supressed the Indian cultures.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The search for liberating thought would have to include the spiritual vision
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of the American Indian, just as it has already begun to acknowledge the
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>contribution of revolutionary Christianity.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>One day, the leader of the cooperative asked me: “What tribe are you
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>from?” A shiver ran down my spine. I don’t think I ever felt so proud
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Suddenly my mestizo blood took sides, as clearly as it had when I was a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>little girl: I was an Indian, even if I had lost my tribe generations ago.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>For me, being an “Indian” means to listen, to let the slow, hidden presence
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>within raise its voice above my European education. This is the business of
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>poetry.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I remembered what Guarani literature had meant to me: poetry for them
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>had the power to heal, to communicate with the divine.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>In their dreams they obtain their most sacred songs, the most powerful,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>those that benefit their fellow men.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Their poetic images were not simply beautiful arrangements of words, they
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were the complete and truthful image of their reality, and they had to be
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>taken “literally,” that is to say, poetically.3
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>But who knows now what it means to think poetically?
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I had known from the beginning that Western civilization had done away
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with poetry as a necessity of life, that poetic thinking was a transgression,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that the poet had to struggle to be heard, because poetry had been divorced
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>from thinking centuries ago.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>But I had had to forget, in order to remember.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Finally I understood the supression of my art and poetry in the context of a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>much larger phenomenon. I concluded that its eroticism (I almost said
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>heroticism, or heroism of the erotic), apparently so shocking to the machis
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mo and Catholic squeamishness of the publishers, had obfuscated the
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>deeper vein of my work; its link with our Ancient American poetic tradition.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Latin American intellectuals, for the most part ignore this tradition, con
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ceiving of pre-Columbian poetry as an aspect of anthropology.

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>strate their Westernness.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The poet Humberto Diaz Casanueva has noted that no anthology of Chilean
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>poetry includes either Mapuche ceremonial poetry, chants and prayers, or
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>their battle harangue.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Only if we choose to understand who we are, and decide to pay heed to our
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ancestors, to the immense richness of their knowledge...
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Only if we choose to respect the surviving Indian communities, will we
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>respect ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Only then will we be able to allow a metamorphosed poetic thinking to arise
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>from our mestizo America, and thus call ourselves an independent people.

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>For the most part, I, as a Black person, have experienced so much overt
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and covert racism that it is hard to focus in on one specific area. When my

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>feel uncomfortable because they were in “minority” settings, I find it hard
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to feel anything for them. Yet these instances stand out in their minds

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>distinct times in my development. I did not grow up in Philadelphia, Penn
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sylvania, as a girl proud of her race. All I knew was what was on television,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>radio; what I learned from school, church, family and peers. I knew that my
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>race came from Africa, but that was nothing to be proud of in the 1950s.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>How could I be proud when Tarzan, the white man, was always Tarzan, the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>right man? I felt proud of Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis, Jr., Harry Belafonte,

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Globetrotters, and a few others. But I only got to see these people when
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>they were on the Ed Sullivan Show or the Nat King Cole Show. My white
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>teachers led me to believe that this was all there was. As a people we did
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>not do anything other than sing, dance, entertain, do sports, get in trouble,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>go to jail, drink and be on relief, a.k.a. welfare.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I can remember being the only Black girl in class when the teacher
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>showed us an anthropological film on—where else but—Africa. It made me
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mad to be a Negro. Why did we have to look like that? Why were we always
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>depicted as savages in skimpy cloth? The class laughed and said things
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>like, “There’s Sylvia.” One tribe had plates in their lips, another suffered
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>from elephantiasis. I felt so low, so bad that day. I was embarrassed and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ashamed.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>I was about 12 years old when I moved to New York. I blossomed into a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>singer and actor. It was a great way for me to break out of my shell, meet
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>people, and be accepted for my talents. l’Il never forget my first year in the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>All City High School Chorus try-outs. I had been called back for my second
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>week of auditions. The altos were sitting in “posture” position to sing.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>started a conversation with a white girl about how nervous I was. She said
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to me, “What are you?” I didn’t know what she meant so I said, “First
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>alto.” “No, I mean you, you know, your background.” What a joke! I am
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>dark enough for it to be obvious so I just said, “Negro.” “You talk real nice,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>you don’t sound like a Negro.” I busted out in this big beautiful smile. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>so happy that I did not sound like a Negro. She made my day.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>In 1967 I joined a group called Hector Rivera and the Latin Renaissance.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>We had just cut an album and I had time off from rehearsals. One of my best
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>friends, Author, asked me to go down South with her and her family for a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>visit. I smiled at the invitation but behind the smile was fear. The South, oh
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>no, they’ll kill me! I was so full of horror stories about what was done to my
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>people in the South by white folks that it took a whole lot of convincing to
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ease my fears. I was told that at least in the South you knew who did not
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>like you but in the North they’ll pat you on the back with one hand and stab
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>you with the other. I was convinced that the South had changed and that
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>people got along better. Anyway, the “colored only/white only” signs were
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>taken down.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>My friend’s family and I went to North Carolina to a dinky town called
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Chockowenity. We went out to eat one night at this restaurant that adver-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>tised that the food was so good that it tasted like Mom made it. By the stares
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>we got when 12 Black people walked into this small town restaurant, you’d
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>think that we had done something wrong. We ordered our food and waited
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>And waited. And waited. I got scared and started thinking about what thev
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>must be doing to my food. I got images of them grinding glass and other junk
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>to make me sick. When the food did come, I did not eat it. I did not trust
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>these white folks. They unnerved me. My only frame of reference for whites
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>with southern accents was the Ku Klux Klan. It was like by day they were
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>normal, by night they wore sheets. My family is mostly from the South and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>although most of them had lost their southern accents I could deal with a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>Black southern accent. Not a white one. Sometimes I still have problems
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>Since I spent a great deal of my time singing throughout New York for
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>various dignitaries and public officials, my racial horizons broadened. I
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>figured that since I learned to discard my fears and prejudices that white
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>folks were doing the same thing. So in 1969 I enrolled in Kingsborough

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Community College in Manhattan Beach. On my way to school one day I met
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>a middle-aged white woman on the train platform. She asked me what was I
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>doing in the neighborhood. I told her I went to Kingsborough. She looked
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>relieved. I found out later that most Black people in the area worked there
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>either cleaning homes, in restaurants, or as other workers. I was too young-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>looking for the above. She asked me what I was studying. I really had not
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>made up my mind yet and I was torn between majoring in music or psychol
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ogy. So I said I was a music major. She smiled and said, “Oh that’s nice.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Your people sing and dance so well.” I didn’t smile. I went to school and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>made a decision to major in psychology. I sang in the chorus and even won
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the music award but I refused to major in it. That’s when I realized the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>difference between the North and South. The South may have “for colored
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>only” signs but the North has “for colored only” minds. In fact every time e
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>white person told me negative things, I excelled in spite of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>My first Black history course was taught by a white woman. She’s the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>one who really changed the course of my life when she told me I was illit
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>erate. After my first B in English, I aimed for and received A’s throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>my college career. I could not wait to find this teacher one year later to
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>show her that I had now become an English tutor. In my quest to please her,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to have her accept me and take back those words, I worked my ass off. I
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>remember going to her office on several occasions to talk to her. She asked
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>me how come I never gave her eye contact. I didn’t know. I never gave
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>anybody eye contact. During the course of her class I learned about how
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>eye contact could mean death to slaves.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>In slavery, Blacks taught their children how to act and how not to act
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>around white folks. Black people were lynched, beaten, and severely pun
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ished for merely looking a white person in the eyes. Eye contact was too
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>close to equality, sharing personal space and meaningful communication.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>These lessons may have been painful sometimes in terms of discipline, but
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>it kept many Black folks alive. I never learned this directly from my parents,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>but they do not usually look people straight in the eyes either. So here I was
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in my teacher’s office, not giving eye contact to this white southern woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>By 1973 I was well into my college life and digging it. This is also the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>year I experienced the Women’s Movement, which changed my life. I some-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>how thought and was led to believe by various women that feminism em
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>braced all women in a common struggle and that everything was better
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>when women worked together. What a joke! I was never more patronized
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in my life. Queens College had a Women’s Festival with a week-long series
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of talks, workshops, and films. I attended almost all of the activities. I
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>walked into each one and experienced being either the only Black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>or one of a few. By the second day I began to see the same faces and women
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>began to open up to me. I was patted on the back by white feminist teachers
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and told such things as, “You’re great, you’re so articulate,” and other
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>things that I at first thought were compliments. I started being invited to
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>faculty andstudent feminist parties. I joined a CR group. I was still basically

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>trying to figure out what feminism was and why so few Black women were
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in it. The following week Queens College was back to normal. Classes as
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>usual. All of a sudden I missed the high I was on. A white woman, whom I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>met during the festival, saw me in the student lounge and came over to talk
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to me. She told me about this meeting that was coming up at the old NOW
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>headquarters in Manhattan for Black women in the Women’s Movement.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>She couldn’t go because she was white and her Black lover did not want to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>go. So I thanked her for the information.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I showed up at this meeting. I was in a room full of approximately 30
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Black women. This was the first time I had seen so many sisters together
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>talking about feminism. Some faces I recognized from Queens College. I felt
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>so good. People like Reverend Magora Kennedy, Michele Wallace, Lore
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Sharpe, and Faith Ringgold were there. Faith termed what we were experi
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>encing “consciousness raging.” I could dig it. I felt it. We knew we had to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>meet again. And we did. Again and again and again until we formed the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>National Black Feminist Organization. We held a press conference and our
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>story was carried in the New York Times. Florence Kennedy, Eleanor
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Holmes Norton, and Shirley Chisolm were just a few who wished us well
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and gave substantive support
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>In the meantime some of my white feminist friends began to have prob
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lems with our organization. They somehow thought that we were dividing
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and therefore weakening the movement. They could not see the need for
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Black women to gather and focus in on issues that specifically spoke to our
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>needs. I said then and I still maintain that this autonomy is necessary. My
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>analogy is simple: During the ’60s Black folks had to go behind closed doors
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to redefine ourselves. We yelled, we screamed, we disagreed, but when we
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>finished, we told the world, “We are BLACK! not NEGRO, not COLORED.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>We insisted on it and we succeeded. The tactics we used ended up being
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the mode of operation for all liberation groups to follow. Similarly, women
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>had to go behind closed doors to scream, disagree, argue until we decided
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>who we were. We emerged as WOMEN, not GIRLS, not CHICKS, not
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>BITCHES, not LADIES. It was accepted. We defined ourselves with strength.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Somehow both of these groups who fought so hard to define themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>could not see the validity of Black women uniting to work on our issues
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Black men and some Black women were led to believe, via Black Nationalist
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>philosophy, that when Black people were liberated, all benefited. Not true.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Thanks to non-Blacks like Daniel P. Moynihan, who wrote “The Moynihar
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Report,” the focus was on finding jobs for Black men. The theory was that il
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the Black man had a job he could therefore take his rightful place as head
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of the household. He would marry Black and take care of his family. I even
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>heard discussions from Black women about how if they were in a situation
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>where the job opportunity came between them and the Black man, they
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>would yield to the Black man. Although Black women worked just as hard
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>as Black men in all of our liberation struggles, sexism was still a major
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>problem. So when some Black women embraced the Women’s Movement,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>somehow we felt that our common struggles were paramount. White femi
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>nists wondered where all the Black women were. One white feminist even
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>told me that the Women’s Movement needed Black women. That we were
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>strong and good leaders. But some Black women soon realized that our
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>issues went far beyond their issues. Black women could not afford to sepa
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>rate ourselves according to income, who lived in which neighborhoods, etc.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Our movement consisted of the women who cleaned white women’s homes.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Our movement consisted of dealing with welfare mothers, household tech
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>nicians, students, single mothers, triply oppressed lesbians, high school
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>dropouts, teachers, lawyers, office workers—in other words, all Black
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>women. We needed to lend support to one another, to network. We needed
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to see each other’s faces, hear our stories. Herstory has shown just how
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>strong Black women are
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>So why didn’t Black men and white women understand that? My dual
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>identification had a tendency to force me to make unreal choices. That is
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>until I became aware and strong enough to deal with the D &amp; C (divide and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>conquer) method. White women wanted me to identify as female and op
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pressed as if I had no color. That was their way of not dealing with racism
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>yet being racist. Black men wanted me to identify as Black because being a
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>female was not an issue. One day I was invited to speak at a women’s con
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ference. A woman asked me: What do I identify most with, being Black or
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>female? That did it. I told the audience that I do not know what my mother
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>noticed first, that I was a girl or her brown baby. I do know, however, that I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was born head first and that is the way I will continue to operate—head
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>first
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>I can remember being at women’s conferences where the slogan “Sister-
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>hood is powerful” was used a lot. White women would address the audi
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ence with the word “sisters.” Somehow I did not feel comfortable with the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>term because I knew that when I used it I meant women of African descent.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Some white women challenged me one day and demanded to know why I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>could not call them sisters. So I told them. When my ancestors were stolen
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>from Africa and brought to Amerika as slaves, families were divided. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>because of health were dropped in the Caribbean. We were bred, traded,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>bought, and rarely knew where to find one another, so when we were so-
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>called “freed” most of us did not know where our relatives were. I have
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>“family” throughout the Third World, in Brazil, Cuba, the West Indies, etc.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>So when I meet someone who says that I remind them of someone that they
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>know, or I meet someone who reminds me of someone else that I know, I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>automatically think that somehow we are all “slave-ancestor-relatives.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Therefore, the words “sister” and “brother” have very significant roots. I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>understood very well why I could not call a white woman my sister. They
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>can be “cousins” only.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>It is not good enough for me just to sport my brown skin and call myself
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Black. To be Black in Amerika is to be politically aware of my past, present,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and future.

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sold good Syrian bread. I remember Faheem and his sister as not good in

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>years in elementary school, there were never any black people. Racism

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>very lush for a fourth grade teacher in a red brick building standing alon
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and treeless in the graveled schoolyard. The sun cast her profile, one lens

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>around whom political and cultural controversies swirled. Picasso did a
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>peace dove, Léger construction workers full of optimism, and Fougeron
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>miners with broken bodies and missing limbs. Anti-Americanism ran high

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ships. Paris was not beautiful to me until I had met someone on that street
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>corner, had lunch in that cafe, and it developed a human history I could

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to him through largely white artists’ groups). I wanted to donate a per

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>vide us. “You’ll be more high class,” they tell our
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>nurses, who think they’d be stepping down to join
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>us. This is their union, they said, and the union

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>you’re not going to change.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Well, what about the fact that they’re white and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>they’re going to be joining a union which is pre
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>dominantly Black and Puerto Rican?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>And a lot of white too.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>It is a predominantly Black and Latin union.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>People always think that this is a Black union be
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>cause the majority of the workers haven’t really
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>seen the full majority of the union members. l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>had the privilege of going to the convention twice,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>where you get people from Kentucky, Virginia,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Alabama—all white. What really made me very
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>happy was that after the last convention we had
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>a dinner first and then the white people had a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>jamboree on their expense for everybody. And
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>we were all jumping together, holding hands to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>gether.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>You associate words like “poor,” “worker,” “la
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>borer,” with color. In this country alone there
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>are definitely more poor whites than poor Blacks
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>because there’s more whites in this country. This
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>is a union of working-class people. It’s just that
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>simple.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>It seems that for a lot of white people that in itself
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>is a challenging situation, because they’re used
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to being in organizations in which whites are the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>majority and suddenly, like in a chapter, they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>a minority.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>I find in organizing that money has no color. I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>started the ball rolling with the secretaries. Up

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>until 1978 we only had the service people and we
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>had the guild; we didn’t have the RNs and we
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>didn’t have the secretaries. By 1978 I happened
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to be talking to a secretary; there I came to find
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her salary was $150 a week. I said to her,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>maid makes more than that.” She goes to her of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>fice and starts talking to her people. And the nex
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>day she comes backto me, she says, “Can I go into
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the union?” I said, “Be my guest.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>There’s discrimination not only in terms of coloi
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>but also in terms of job. One position being better
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>than another position. One class being better
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>than another class.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Some of the nurses are very prejudiced. They
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>think because they wear a white dress, you are
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>nothing if you wear a blue dress. A couple of days
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ago there was a problem with a patient. I showec
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>it to a nurse and she didn’t do nothing about the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>whole mess on the floor. So I said to her, “Why
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>don’t you get some soap and clean up some of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that stuff?” and she said, “I have to do that? Why
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>don’t you do it?” I said, “No. That’s your depart-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ment.” She had to do it. I just walk away and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>leave her. And she did it.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Sometimes when we hear the word “prejudice,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the first thing that pops into our minds is Black
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and white. But it’s not always Black and white.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>My boss, he wouldn’t care if you’re pink, brown,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>blue. He’s just prejudiced. He’s sick. Prejudice is
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>a sickness. Like cancer. You might contract can
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cer in one part of the body but eventually it
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>spreads out over the whole body.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>In the health care field and in the hospital we
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>have all nationalities, all colors, and we all work
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>together for a common purpose; we all get along
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>beautifully. Between management and your em
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ployee, there’s the prejudice. Like you say, I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>think it makes any difference what color you are.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>If you’re union, they don’t want any part of you.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Part of this anti-union thing is everyone becomes
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>supervisor. It becomes part of you. You got to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>make those workers produce, and you will get
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>somebody on your back to make these workers
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>produce. The process divides us. Racism, or any
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>other kind of prejudice. You had college, what
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ever, that divides us. And that’s what they want
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to do. You will see that all these managemen
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>guides will bring in these things. They have these
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>labor consultants that they hire, guys who come
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in with the most prejudices, in terms of nation
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>ality, in terms of color, because they really say
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>what the boss wants them to say.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Iheard my boss say (he didn’t know I was there)
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>“I want you to whip those guys into line. Come
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>down on them. Let ’em have it. Whip those guys.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>It is a racial prejudice thing, because over me I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>have managers, right? They don’t want me as a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>supervisor in a department, so they will give my
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>department more work to do than the department
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>next to me which is doing the same job. I say it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>color. l’m Black and she’s white, and she has
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>more people in her department than I have in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>mine. Why should they give my department the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>larger load?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>If you’re pushing to get more work out, the oppo
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>sition is the worker, who says, “I just want to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>work like a human being; I don’t want to be
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>rushed.” After a while you develop an attitude.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>It’s like a guy becomes a cop. He may be a nice
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>guy, but after going to a couple of riots and deal
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing with some of these people out there, he devel
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ops a hardness. And it’s tough. And it’s the same
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>thing with supervision. We want to get him to do
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>more work and he don’t want to do it and he gives
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>me a hard time, l’m going to say he’s a creep.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>I think she’s right. As far as prejudice betweer
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Black and white in our clerical.... Before they
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>re-unionized, there was not one colored or minor
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ity in the whole clerical division in that hospital
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>And we were having problems bringing them in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>every time there’s a job open. We had a battle
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>royal for everyone we brought in.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Once there was a nurse and she was so preju
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>diced I was shocked. That attitude of prejudice
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>towards the housekeeper. Everybody tried to get
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>rid of her. If you’re Black and you come in there
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to ask her about a patient, she goes: “You see me
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>doing something, can’t you read?” etc. If a white
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>person comes in, it’s: “Can I help you, ma’am?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>We have a cafeteria, and this cafeteria is for
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>everybody—nurses, housekeepers. When every-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>body’s off, it says “closed.” A few minutes later
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>when the nurses come marching down from ma
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ternity, you see the sign removed. They have to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bar it up, so that we nurses’ aides, workers, we
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>won’t sit there. But this is a cafeteria for every
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>body.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Uniformed workers and non-uniformed workers.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Uniformed workers tend to have a harder way
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sometimes. This tends to cause a lot of friction. It
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>gets into a class thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Going into a hospital division where we did have
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>a race problem. They had a very large operation
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in Flushing Hospital. In all the years that it was

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>open, there was not one Black there who worked
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>as an aide. When I became the delegate we had
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>won seniority in our contract and there were
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>nursing aides who worked there long years and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>wanted to come downstairs to central. Our super
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>visor, she would never admit to being a racist or
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>prejudiced in any way, but I had to fight each
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and every one of those cases. She would hold
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>them upstairs on the floors. I brought the first
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Black down and now it’s even-steven. We even
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>had it in the contract and they fought it. A white
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>person, well, she wanted to come down. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>really a fight, even after we had seniority. So
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>there you meet prejudice with a department head
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that wants to keep the department white. It’s the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>other way too sometimes.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>What are they afraid of? What are they afraid is
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>going to happen if these Black and Hispanic peo
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ple get treated equally?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>They’re afraid of unity. At our hospital, where
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the working people are concerned, the majority,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>like secretaries and RNs are solidly white. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>service unit we’re majority Black. And they don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>want us to have the power, because we do have
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>it. We didn’t need the organizer to come in there.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>We controlled the hospital. It would be nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>for us to pull 600 people and set them right in the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>lobby.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>No one in the administration is Black. The only
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>person that they put is a department head or a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>housekeeper because they feel they have to han
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>dle a lot of Blacks and Hispanics. Otherwise all of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>administration is predominantly white.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>You ask what they’re afraid of—having the Blacks
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>in power. This is only my feeling. I may be wrong
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>They have a white majority in our administration
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>too. They have meetings, and there are certain
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>things they discuss. Say they want to cut the bud
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>get. And they sit around and make plans of how
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>to work around cutting the staff. So they will
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>make some dirty schemes: Well, look, force them
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to do some things that will get them fired, won’
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>have to give them unemployment. Now if they hac
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>a Black there or a Spanish man there, he’s not
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>going to sit down and listen to that kind of thing
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and go along with it with his workers. Especially
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Spanish people. They stick together like glue
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>They’re liable to take those workers in a corner
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>and say, “Look, I want you to be careful. Don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>spit, don’t loiter, don’t litter. There’s a possibility
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>you’ll get fired.” I feel that management wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>want those people up there to forward us, cause
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>they couldn’t have a chance to get rid of us.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Most hospitals act like they are run by the direc
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>tor, but are actually run by the board of trustees.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>And they’re pressured. They just don’t deal with
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Blacks. They hire you to do that dirty work.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>What happens to all this equal rights legislation?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>They pay into the educational system, our grad
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ing and upgrading fund. They have upgraded
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>everything now.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>What does upgrading mean?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>For instance, when you went into housekeeping,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>you didn’t use to have to know how to run a wax-
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>ing machine, you didn’t have to say that you knew
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>how to mop a floor. Now you must have experi-
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ence for that. Now in certain areas you must
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>have high school education, so they’ll say, “We
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>are paying you the training and upgrading fund,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we want something for our money. So this is
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>how they’re getting around the fact that we
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>have a hiring hall, making them take the union
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>people first. This person must have a qualifi
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cation. If they hire someone off the street they
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>don’t have to have it. They’re asking a porter
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>for a high school diploma, just for moving a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>mop.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N013'/>Was there ever a point in any of your orga
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N014'/>nizing where you have openly discussed any
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N015'/>kind of prejudice that arose, where it was
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N016'/>talked about, the attitude the nurses had
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N017'/>toward nonprofessionals?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N018'/>On the ninth floor we have a monthly staff
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N019'/>meeting. Our NPC—the head nurse—she
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N020'/>always talked down to us. So we all got
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N021'/>together at a staff meeting and brought it
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N022'/>out to her; she wasn’t aware that she
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N023'/>was talking down to us. We told her,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N024'/>Didn’t you ever work around Blacks
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N025'/>before?” She said, “I never have, you
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N026'/>have to give me a chance and try to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N027'/>help me along. She was up there, and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N028'/>we were down here, and instead of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N029'/>coming on the same level, she would
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N030'/>come out with, “You do this and you
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N031'/>better do it, and she forgot you were
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N032'/>a human being.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N033'/>Like she wouldn’t say “please.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N034'/>No, she’d say, “Do it or you’ll get written up.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N035'/>And we got tired of it, and mostly the union mem
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N036'/>bers....she would demand us to do things in a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N037'/>way, and we told her there’s ways to go about ask-
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N038'/>ing, you don’t come out and just demand.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N039'/>When she said that thing of not being used to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N040'/>working with Blacks, did she also work that way
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N041'/>with white workers who were at the same level
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N042'/>as you?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N043'/>No, she never did.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_1' n='N044'/>So how did they respond when she said she’s not
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_2' n='N045'/>used to working Blacks?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_3' n='N046'/>They were surprised, everybody was shocked.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_4' n='N047'/>She said she came from a little hospital and there
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_5' n='N048'/>was all white people in Canarsie, etc., the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_6' n='N049'/>thing. She still acts that way. She’s improved a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_7' n='N050'/>little bit, but you can see that it’s still there.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_8' n='N051'/>What would you say is the main kind of prejudice
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_9' n='N052'/>that you find working in the hospital? Is it Black/
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_10' n='N053'/>white, age, male/female, status?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_11' n='N054'/>Male/female. I find that the female doctors,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_12' n='N055'/>they’re constantly on their guard, they constantly
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_13' n='N056'/>have to prove themselves, cause they’re in the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_14' n='N057'/>minority. And they constantly have to struggle,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_15' n='N058'/>they’re very very defensive, there’s all this sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_16' n='N059'/>innuendo.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_17' n='N060'/>What kind of sexual innuendos?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_18' n='N061'/>At my hospital recently a female doctor got hit by
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_19' n='N062'/>a male doctor, physically pushed, and it hap
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_12_1_tl_20' n='N063'/>pened once and she reported it to everybody,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>then he did it again. She’s having trouble getting
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>anyone to take this seriously. People are amused
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>by it instead of incensed by it.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_1' n='N004'/>Do you think it&apos;s because she’s a woman?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_2' n='N005'/>Yes. He wouldn’t take a chance with a man.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_3' n='N006'/>Maybe he pushed her because he likes her.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_4' n='N007'/>(Laughter.)
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_5' n='N008'/>I think it’s an extension of what happens on the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_6' n='N009'/>outside with male/female pick-up kinds of things.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_7' n='N010'/>We had an incident—to give you an example of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_8' n='N011'/>just how powerful the doctors are, and how lim
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_9' n='N012'/>ited the nurses are. I was working in the emer
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_10' n='N013'/>gency room and this doctor came in; he crossed
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_11' n='N014'/>his legs and I saw he was wearing a gun on his
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_12' n='N015'/>leg. I said to him, “I’m petrified of guns; when a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_13' n='N016'/>cop comes in l’m panicky.” I said to him, “You
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_14' n='N017'/>don’t need that thing here. Go put it in your lock
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_15' n='N018'/>er. l’m afraid to work in the room if you’re gonna
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_16' n='N019'/>have a gun.” He said, “I have a right to defend
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_17' n='N020'/>myself, blah blah blah... I said, “Who’s going
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_18' n='N021'/>to kill you? l’m here. l’Il protect you. So sure
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_19' n='N022'/>enough, I called the administrator. Can’t take
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_20' n='N023'/>that kind of responsibility, he could blow his toes
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_13_1_tl_21' n='N024'/>off. The administrator came and said that every
			</p>
			<pb n='28'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>American has a right to bear arms. And he let
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the man work with a gun. I went to work in a dif-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ferent portion. But believe me, if it was a nurse or
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>an aide or an orderly or the guy in the kitchen,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>you don’t think they’d let them wear a gun.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>l’ve gone to the Operating Room in a lot of cases
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and I just want to bear witness to what we’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>been saying. It’s always been traditional almost
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that they abuse the nurses. And of course they
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>say they’re under strain, so forth and so on. But
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the language they use would make anybody blush
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in the street. And there’s no doubt, when they
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>have male technicians, they will be different than
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>they are to the nurses. They respect them as men.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>They wipe their hands on a towel. If l’m there
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>they will throw the towel on the floor. If there’s a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>male taking care of them, they’re going to put it in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a linen basket
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Speaking about prejudice, I work in a unit with
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>all kinds of kids. Now we had a Chinese patient
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>come in, very sick with hepatitis. He was spilling
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>blood all over the place. We found out that in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>stead of putting it in the basin they were putting
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>it in the garbage can right after cleaning. The
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>patient died. A month later, the head of nursing
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>came in: “Who was working with such and such
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>patient? We got the report; he had the worst type
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of hepatitis. Who was working here?” She by-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>passed me. l’m standing there. We work every
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>day on that unit. So I said, “What’s going on?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>“Oh, she says, “it don’t call for you!” The idea
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>was that these people who had worked with him
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>had to get shots, or else they would get hepatitis.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Everyone got the works with the exception of the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>two Black people that were working there. Sc
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>when she was ready to leave, I said, “Excuse me
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Miss. What the hell happened to me that I was on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the ward and I don’t need help?” She said, “Now
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>don’t get excited.” I said, “Why? Is my skin the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>kind of skin that won’t pick up anything?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>l’ve worked in recovery. Patients will say to me,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>“Oh, I can’t believe I see a white nurse. I have all
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>these chocolate people. And all the doctors are
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>dark. Everybody in the hospital is dark.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>I have a joke for you. This is both a joke and is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>true. This patient is sick. The nurse there says,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>“Good morning, l’m going to give you a sponge
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>bath.&quot; “Who, you?” She said, “Yes. Patient
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>says, “You ain’t gonna touch me!” Nurse said,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>“Why?” She said, “Because no Black person
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>gonna give me a bath. You have to get a white
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>nurse in here.&quot; The girl’s with tears, she is so
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>embarrassed. I came in behind. We use black
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>bags for the garbage. So in I come, shaking the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>bag. Patient says, “Where you gonna put that?”
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>said, “In the garbage pail.” She says, “I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>need no black bag in my garbage pail!
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Sounds like a nut to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>No, she was not. I wouldn’t take that black bag
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>out. The supervisor had to come with one of those
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>small white plastic bags and put it in that gar

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>One wanted me to come clean up her house. She

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>you could pay my price?” “Oh yeah, my hus-

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Some of our ladies was upstairs serving the food,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in microwave ovens, and they were having a fire
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>drill. So the assistant security guard, he walked
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in and said, “Get this damn thing out of here,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>we’re having a fire drill.” I pushed it out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>way, and they made a big case out of it. So we
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>went into the office, and as we walked in he said
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>“Come on down, girls, sit down, girls.” These are
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ladies that are 45-46 years old. “Sit down, girls.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I told him, “I think that’s the problem; you forget
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>these women are not girls. These are grown
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ladies, and I expect that you should treat them
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>accordingly.” He said, “Being that l’m so much
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>older than they are, they’re girls to me.” Like l’n
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>supposed to sop this shit up. I said, “Cool, that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the way you feel, but they’re not girls.” l’m not
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>into the game part of it. I do a lot of laughing and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>joking; that’s a side of me, but when it comes
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>down to, what do you call it, nitty-gritty time?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>When it comes time to get down on it, I can get
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>down just as hard as anyone else.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>It’s kind of hard for me to sit here and talk about
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>prejudice because it’s somèthing that I have
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>eaten my entire life, that l’ve had to live with,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>something that l’ve seen. I remember going to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Cortland State, 250 miles, people looking at me
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>like l’m a goddamned zombie. Ah, who is this?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Because I was Black. It’s hard to talk about prej
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>udice when you know that it still exists. It hasn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>slowed down at all. If anything it’s speeded up
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>It’s hard to talk about prejudice when you see
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>children, Black children, who have problems
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>real problems when they go to school, and you
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>see a timid white woman walks into the class
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The main thing is that she wants to survive so she
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>can go home, so her thing is surviving behavior
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>She spends so much time with survival, so much
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>time trying to get everybody to behave, that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>teaching is a luxury. And then at the same time,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>this little boy grows up to be an ass, and can’t get
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>a job, has to sweep streets and things like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>And people still play along with that. There’s a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>lot of prejudice in the hospitals; when you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>dealing with the hospital workers and the guild
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>workers, there’s prejudice in that. There’s a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>of prejudice when you’re talking about education.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>When you talk about rank and file, and status. As
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>you go up the ladder, the more prejudiced you
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>become. Now we can talk about Black and white
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>prejudice which is always going to be there. You
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>can sit back and look at it right now. How come
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>as a Black person, I sit back and say well, hey
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Black people in this country were waiting for the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Italians, they was sitting here waiting for the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Jews, and some of you might have come at the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>same time. And the saddest prejudice is the story
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>of the American Indian. No one even talks about
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>that; they don’t even show it on TV. They show
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>the cowboy honkies riding down. He’s talking
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>about the Indians are savages, right? Indians
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>knew how to live among themselves. They was
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>called savages.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>Did you ever find a Black nurse prejudiced
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>against her own kind?

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the way they talk. They talk through their noses.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Do you think that’s the position the person’s in?

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>People take advantage of the fact that you have a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>language barrier. Like, we got one Spanish guy
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>who works in our department, who washes pots
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>all the time. Like, he’s required to have every
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>third weekend off, but sometimes they bring this
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>guy in four weekends straight. I try to explain
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>certain things to him, get someone else to talk to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>him, but then it’s a matter of him feeling that he
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>might lose his job. A lot of them don’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>enough about the union to know that there are a

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>A lot of them can speak English. I take my time
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with any patient I meet. I find that the majority
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>don’t have any problem understanding me. Lots
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of times maybe it’s that they’re not comfortable
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>because of their English, or it’s easier for them
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>when they have somebody.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Was what you said an implication that they pre

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>l’m Spanish and I don’t agree. Came here 17
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>years ago from Colombia, South America. I speak
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>English before I came here. One day I remember I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>had a big problem with a doctor and a patient.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>He wanted me to interpret this Spanish patient
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>who didn’t know one word of English and he
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>wanted me to tell her that she must learn English,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>that he could not attend to her because she did
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>not know English. And he made me so angry and I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>said to him, I said, “Why don’t you go and learn
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Spanish?” I said, “You are on the same basis
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>with that patient. You cannot learn Spanish, she
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>cannot learn English.” I said, “You know some-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>thing, doc, I think you’re nasty. And the nurse in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>charge, she says, “Mrs. Jackson, how dare you
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>talk to the doctor like that?” I said, “T’m Mrs.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Jackson and he’s Mr. So and So.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>I just want to say that all the prejudice that you
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>find on the outside you find in the hospital. You
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>find men against women, you find white/Black.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>you find West Indian Black against American
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Black, Jews against gentiles, gentiles against
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Jews, poor against rich, rich against poor.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>As a matter of fact I would say it’s amazing that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>we have gone as far as we have and got the kind
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>of unity that we have, in spite of the fact that in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>the back of people’s minds it’s there. But they
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>fight against it. I think there have been gains in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>that sense, because otherwise we wouldn’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>here what we got here today. But we just reflect
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>what goes on in the outside world. It’s all there
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>just to divide us, objectively speaking. That’s

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Upstairs, ma’am.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Doing what at this hour, if you don’t mind?
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Having a bath.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The black hair was dripping down the damp back, the waist, the but
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tocks; very long hair, now wound up after the shampoo, held up by a red
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>comb, a handful heavy as a horse’s mane.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>“Didn’t you tell me to have a bath every day?”
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>“But not during your working hours.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The bather looked at her, and Teleca saw the red tree of resentment in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N019'/>her eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N020'/>Bring me my breakfast.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N021'/>&quot;OK.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N022'/>“That’s no way to answer. Say, Yes, ma’am.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N023'/>“Uh-huh.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N024'/>“Say, Yes, ma’am,”” Teleca almost shouted.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N025'/>The woman was silent. Then she seemed to make up her mind: “Yes,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N026'/>ma’am.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N027'/>Teleca slammed the door as she left the kitchen. In her bedroom, she
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N028'/>could do nothing but go from one place to another, pick up one thing after
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N029'/>another, put it somewhere else, lose it, pace back and forth next to the door
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N030'/>like a caged lion. She couldn’t wait for the moment when she could go back
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N031'/>to the kitchen, see what Lupe was doing, look at her face, smooth as a river
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N032'/>pebble, begin again, choose more tactful words. “T’m going to wait five min
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N033'/>utes.” She went into the bathroom and brushed her hair furiously. The tele
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N034'/>phone rang. She thanked the lord for that phone call. Lupe was late in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N035'/>answering, dragged her feet toward the telephone, and slowly came to
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N036'/>knock at the door.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N037'/>“Somebody for you.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N038'/>Teleca’s heart beat faster.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N039'/>&quot;“Say, There’s a telephone call for you, ma’am.’ Besides, you took your
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N040'/>time about answering
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N041'/>That wasn’t what she wanted to say. She wanted to assume a serene
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N042'/>expression, the smile trembling on her lips, ready to blossom and open.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N043'/>Drops of water were still falling from Lupe’s mane. Teleca pushed her aside.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N044'/>“Who is it? Oh, Arthur! How delightful. Are you all right? Well, just
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N045'/>so-so. I feel so nervous, I don’t know why, maybe it’s the domestic dramas;
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N046'/>you know those people just don’t understand, however much one would
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N047'/>like to approach them, there’s just no way, at any rate I can’t find one;
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N048'/>oh yes, I know there are other topics of conversation, but you see that’s
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N049'/>my everyday experience and that’s what I have to talk about. It helps
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N050'/>calm my nerves. ...At the Lady Baltimore? At five? Yes, of course. What
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N051'/>fun! Bye-bye... Thanks.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N052'/>Teleca walked toward the kitchen. “Can it be that a ragged Indian can
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N053'/>get me into this state? But. ..it’s impossible. It’s not fair! It’s this loneliness
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N054'/>that&apos;s...
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N055'/>“Lupe, my breakfast.

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N057'/>At least she said, “Yes, ma’am.” Lupe entered with the tea, the warm
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N058'/>egg, the toast, the dazzling white cup, the sugar cubes in a sugarbowl just
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N059'/>as dazzling.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N060'/>“And the newspaper, isn’t it here yet?
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_8_1_tl_37' n='N061'/>“T’Il go see.

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Teleca tried to concentrate on the headlines; she realized she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>care, nothing interested her except Lupe, to know what Lupe was thinking,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to follow her, stop next to her as she stood at the washtub, look at her
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>strong round arms, her arms, two apple trees extending into leafy twigs—
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>how pretty her fingertips were, wrinkled from the washwater—hear her
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>young voice, juicy as her hands. Lupe must have secretly noticed the power
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she had over her mistress, because she frowned and curled her lip haughti-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ly, in a temper. When she finished breakfast, Teleca went into the kitchen.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“T’m going to take a bath.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Lupe was silent.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Kéep your ears open for the telephone and the doorbell.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Uh-huh.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Teleca felt her nerves getting raw; she could have struck her, pulled
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that damp handful hanging over the Indian, Indian, Indian shoulders. But
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>she also would have liked to see her smile, her eyes bright, cheeks shining
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>—how newly washed brown skin glows!—to hear her ask, in the musical
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>voice of earlier days, “Is everything all right, ma’am?” Everything all right,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>everything all right. nothing was, all right. Teleca made her morning
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ablutions with Lupe on her mind, forecasting her one p.m. face, the friendly
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>gesture or sparkle in her eye; maybe Lupe will be nice when I leave. She
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>imagined the details, “Lupe, l’m&apos;leaving now; remember, l’m not lunching
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>at home today, l’m going to the Güemes, as I told you yesterday.” “Yes,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ma’am, that&apos;s fine l’Il polish the silver. Have a good time, ma’am. Once in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a while she’s said, “Have a lovely time, and Teleca still remembered it
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>gratefully. Lupe had stayed with her longer than any other girl. Her soli-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tude made Teleca appreciate the shared hours, the other presence in the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>house. At first she used the familiar, but when something angered her, she
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>brandished formalities to emphasize the distance. “When I leave, l’Il ca
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>sually tell her to take the radio into the kitchen, so she won’t be bored,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Teleca thought. “But what’s happening to me? l’m paying too much atten
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tion to her, as if Lupe were the only person in my life. My nerves are play
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ing tricks on me. What must Lupe think of me? Does she like me? What a
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>close-mouthed woman! She’s a blind lump of dough
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Just at the doorway, Teleca adjusted her hat and said with false gaiety:
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>“Lupe? l’m leaving now. See you at five.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>The only answer was the hum of cars in the Avenue of the Insurgents.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>So Teleca yelled, in a less friendly voice: “Lupe? l’m leaving. Have my tea
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ready at five, and don’t leave streaks on the silverware. Remember now,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the polish and a flannel cloth, not soap and a scrub-brush, like last time.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Silence amplified her order.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>“Lupe? Lupe, did you hear me?
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>“Uh-huh.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>The words echoed mournfully, coming perhaps from the kitchen or the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ironing board or the inside of a closet or who knows where, from the thick
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>darkness in which Lupe moved, that squaw, that idiot, that smelly creature,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>I don’t know why l’m worrying about a beast like that. And Teleca marched
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>out. “It will do me good to see some people of my own sort and give up this
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>useless effort to uplift the ones who are past saving.” She walked toward
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the Güemes’ house, her dress swirling around her legs, but at the first cor-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ner she almost turned back. “I didn’t tell her to turn on the radio in the kitch-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>en, and she remembered that slow, heavy, muddy “uh-huh” and thought
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>(with what she imagined to be a pedagogical impulse): “It will do her good.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>She’Il miss me. Of course she’ll miss me. It’s awful to be alone in a house.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>She imagined herself in earlier years, alone in her kitchen with no one to
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>teach good manners to, anxiously waiting for the water about to boil furi
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ously in the tea kettle, defenseless against the attack of the bells, ready to
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>start up a conversation with anyone, the first street vendor, the newspaper
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>boy, yes, yes, like any alley cat; she remembered the warnings she had
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>written for herself in a convent student’s angular hand and had stuck up in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>plain sight, in the kitchen, the hall, not so much because she needed them
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>don&apos;t forget to turn off
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>as to keep her company: “Please close the door,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>the gas, “check your keys before leaving, “the electricity bill is due the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>first Friday of every month,” “any effort is a success in itself.” And in large
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>letters, the numbers that connected her to the outside world. Teleca was
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>ready to scream, anxiety pressing on her heart: “Help, I can’t breathe.” Or
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>to run as she now ran toward the Güemes’ house, where she entered pant-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>ing, ruffled as a sparrow that takes refuge in the rafters. “How are things?
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>How are things? You look so pretty sitting here!” The Güemes raised star-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>tled eyes to their friend’s fluttering. What did she mean, “pretty,” when
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>they looked like a couple of witches? Teleca immediately asked to use the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>telephone.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>Iforgot to tell Lupe something.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_9_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>“We’re having souffle to start with, Teleca, don’t be long.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>She took the receiver off the hook. A bell sounded, extended itself on the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>air, an unanswered signal. How long would that lazy squaw take to answer
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Teleca nervously dialed again. The third time was the charm.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>“Lupe.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>stony, almost impenetrable face. Teleca would often call home to give some
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>advice, to make sure Lupe was there. She would keep on and on until she
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>found her and then scold her: “Where did you go? Who told you you could
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>go out? You can’t go out and leave the house empty, like a child!” That&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>“Yes, but I forgot to tell him.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>“Ah!&quot; said Lupe suspiciously.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Did you open the bathroom window? The towels have to be aired be
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>fore it rains. You always forget.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Teleca hated the Güemes for interrupting the dialogue, but she had to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>give in. “All right, l’Il call later to see what has been happening.” She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>heard a murmur that sounded like “uh-huh” and the click of the telephone
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>“That dirty beast, she hung up on me, she didn’t even give me time to say
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>goodbye, but l’Il get even, l’Il call her after coffee.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The obsessed have the strange power of attracting everyone to the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>center of their spiral; they press harder and harder, closing tighter at each
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>turn until the circle becomes a single point, a whirling drill. At the table
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Teleca brought the conversation around to servants—in French, of course,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>so the good Josephine wouldn’t understand.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>“Why are servants such idiots?
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“Because if they weren’t they wouldn’t be servants.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>“It’s because this is a brutish race. In France, in England, in Spain,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>servants are different. They know how to behave, they realize to whom
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>they’re speaking, they’re responsible, they’re of a different sort, but these
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>brutes who don’t... who don’t even have a mat to drop dead on, aren’t
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>even grateful for the favor you’re doing them.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>“I think it’s the sun. They’re out in the sun so much they’ve all got
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sunstroke.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>“Or the Spanish Conquest.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>“Oh yes, they lost everything with the Conquest, even their sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>shame
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>“It’s the whole race. They’re definitely low on gray matter.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Teleca went on talking without a break until coffee was served. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>her way of being close to Lupe, circling around her, evoking her. One of the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Güemes sisters, fat and good-natured, suggested (to block the avalanche):
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>“Why don’t we play a little bridge, right now? We can take our coffee witl
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>They agreed. At five Teleca cried: “T’ve got a date with Arthur in the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Lady Baltimore at five. How awful! l’Il never get there in time. If l’d thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I would have put it off, since I knew I was having lunch with you.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>What really bothered her was not calling Lupe. Now she couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>When? Where? There was no way to leave Arthur alone at his table in the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tea room.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>“What a shame the chauffeur isn’t here, otherwise he could drop you
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>off, Teleca
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>“It doesn’t matter. I just love taxi drivers.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Over tea, apropos of Teleca’s comments, Arthur launched into a long
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>dissertation on the Conquest according to Bernal Diaz del Castillo. Tha
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>wasn’t what she was after. Nobody could give her what she was looking
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>for, nobody but Lupe. Would Arthur ever finish and go away? But Arthur, e
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dilettante of history, seemed ready to examine everything, down to the U.S
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>laws on racial segregation. Teleca felt sick to her stomach. Arthur stretche
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>out his arm toward her necklace.

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Because of the worm inside?”
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Precisely. Perhaps, on account of that worm, it’s worth fifteen slaves.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>“Oh, Arthur, let’s go.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Defiantly, without waiting for him, Teleca got up. There was something
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of the clumsy boy about Teleca that disconcerted Arthur even while it
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>attracted him. Her way of taking the stairs two at a time, her long thin legs
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that galloped rather than walked, her hipless body, her intent, tea-colored
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>eyes—hadn’t they taught her not to stare at people when she was a little
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>girl? Her open smile, from ear to ear, that revealed wide white teeth, strong
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>as grains of corn left out in the sun and wind. Teleca winked, too. “It comes
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>naturally, she said when they reproved her.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>l’m going to play bridge at the Lucerne; I can drop you off in a taxi,

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>“Torres Bodet. Haven’t you read The Counterfeiters yet?”
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>“I told you l’m very nervous. I can’t concentrate.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>If you read it, you’d forget your nerves. Look,” said Arthur, pressing
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>his nose against the window, “it’s night already. In Mexico, it gets dark all
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>at once. Either there’s nothing happening at all and we’re absolutely
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>smothered in the thickest boredom, or else we have a catastrophe and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>everything’s over. My God, what a country!&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>“It’s your country...
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Arthur smiled mockingly. “You’re so contradictory, Teleca. This sudden
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>patriotism doesn’t suit you. After all, you’re always talking about leaving
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>for Spain.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>“But meanwhile I stand up for the dark.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>“The black holes?
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Teleca didn’t answer. She felt a strange sense of solidarity with Lupe.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>She could kick her, but in front of anyone else she defended passionately
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>anything related to Indians: the earth, the forest, beans, corn, warm stones.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Look, she hasn’t even remembered to turn on the light in the entryway.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Arthur got out of the taxi and stretched out his hand, a soft hand with
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>very pink, fine, thin nails, like a newborn baby’s. He bowed low to kiss
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Teleca’s glove.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>“Beautiful Teleca.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>She’s left the street dark!&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Arthur made his nails dance like lightning bugs.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>“Light, more light.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>“Please Arthur, try to understand. Your mother takes care of every-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>thing for you, you don’t understand how hard it is to deal with these people.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Arthur’s lips, as rosy as his fingernails, curved in an annoyed grimace.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>He smiled, and they grew thin to the point of cruelty. Nevertheless, in their
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>natural state they were full, so full that they stuck out
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>“Telequita, do some reading. l’Il talk to you tomorrow. I want your
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>opinion.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Teleca abruptly stuck her key in the door. She could just glimpse Arthur
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>striking the driver lightly on the shoulder with the handle of his cane, and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the taxi drove off.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Teleca strode up the stairs. “Lupe, Lupe! Hasn’t anything happened?
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>She went on up to the second floor. “Lupe?” She passed through the ironing
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>room, the kitchen. “Where has that squaw got to? She must be snoring in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>her room.”“Lupe? Didn’t anyone call?” She stopped at the top of the maid’s
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>staircase. “Lupe. Lupeeeee!” Teleca never entered the room in the attic. It
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>was one of her rules. “Maybe she’s in the library waxing the furniture. I
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>doubt it, but anyway...” She headed for it hopefully. When she opened the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>door, the bookcases gleamed, and Teleca followed the ray of light with her
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>eyes; in the darkness they acquired the tonality of a Vermeer; some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>corners seemed to float in the air, cutting it, their edges shining; the round
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>arm of a sofa lit up in the darkness, silky and electric as the humped back
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>of a cat. Time polishes, time melts, time shapes. “It smells shut-in. Not only
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>is she not here, she hasn’t been here for a long time, even though I ordered
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>her to. What a filthy woman. She went up the stairs again. “Lupe, Lupe,&apos;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>she went flying through the rooms, “Lupe.” Again she stood at the foot of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the maid’s staircase and shouted, shielding her call with both hands,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>“Lupe!&quot; She had never been so slow in answering. “Smelly old thing. Uppity
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Indian!” Finally, Teleca decided to climb the stairs. Her heels caught in the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>iron steps; she almost fell through. Above she heard the water tank drip
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ping. There were no sheets on the washing lines. She burst into the room; it
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>didn’t even have a lock. The smell of feet, sweat, and confinement assaulted
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>her and made her gasp in search of breath.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“She must have gone out to buy bread... but. .. at this hour? She never,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>never goes at this hour. Besides, l’ve told her never to leave the house
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>empty. l’m going to get after her, I can’t stand having her around, she’s bad
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>for me.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>She went through the stripped room. She looked for the cartons Lupe
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>had brought her things in. Nothing. She opened the closet. Nothing. The
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>breeze lashed the bare window. At last Teleca had to yield to the evidence.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>&quot;She’s left.” She went down the stairway without noticing what she was
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>doing and went directly to her room. The key, yes, the key. No, she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>take anything. There is the jewelry. She waited a few minutes in the middle
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of the bedroom, her arms hanging at her sides, not knowing what to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>There was not a sound in the house. Teleca allowed herself to swoon at the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>feet of her fear, beside herself from the search, her emotion. She tried to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>encourage herself. “Well, that’s better. l’d planned to fire her anyway. She
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was always looking down on me. She’s saved me a scene. I was bored with
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>that flat nose, anyway. Traitor. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good, or
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>what’s that saying? Traitor. It’s the best thing that could have happened.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>She began by taking off her hat, switching on the bedside lamp, closing
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the curtains one by one. A rosy light spread through the room. The houses
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of the rich always glow with a rosy light. Almost euphoric, she went to the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>kitchen to look for the water pitcher she kept beside her bed at night, and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the glass. “Now l’m really going to read The Counterfeiters. I didn’t plan on
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>eating dinner anyway, so how could it matter?” She came and went, walked
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>through the living room, crossed the dining room, her heels resounding like
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>castanets, up, left, right, turn. “I sound like a flamenco dancing teacher,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>she told herself affectionately; she put two of the vases of flowers in the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>hall. “Pig, the water is green, she didn’t even change it. Lupe! Lupe! But I
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>must be crazy, she’s done me a favor by getting out of here. Yes ’getting out
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of here,’ the way they say it, even though it sounds so ugly.” She hung up
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her coat, or rather tried to, in front of the closet. “Lupe, where are all the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>hangers? The wooden one for my coat is missing. “I’m obviously deliri
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ous, my mind is wandering, I keep talking to that wretch in my mind all the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>time tomorrow l’Il wear lacquer red it’s the color that suits me best has that
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>idiot thrown my shoes out? Lupe! Lupe!” Exhausted, Teleca fell to the car
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>pet and rocked her head in her hands. Only then did she notice that her
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>cheeks were wet. She couldn’t have been crying all this time! She forced
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>back a sob, “Little Lupe! The best thing for me to do is lie down, take a tran
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>quilizer, tomorrow l’Il look for somebody else.” Teleca often forgot she had
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>a body—it was so light—but now it was burning, echoing, amplifying all the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>noises inside. Teleca stretched out her arms to turn back the beautiful,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>thick damask coverlet that had been her parents’; she did it slowly, care
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>fully, and suddenly, there on the sparkling linen, at the height of the hand
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>embroidered A and S interlaced under the family emblem, she saw the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>excrement, an enormous turd that spread out in concentric circles, in a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>terrifying rainbow, green, coffee-colored, greenish-yellow, ashy, steaming.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>In the silence, the stink began to rise.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Years later, when Teleca told Arthur—she had never dared tell anyone

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>are afraid to come from anything other than

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>to expect from me. They are ill at ease and run

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>about what’s being done to the poor da
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>kies, they

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ing Black people.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I have yet to hear white women talk about
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Black women as people, as individuals they like
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>or dislike. In the conversations I have heard, we
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>are either “heroic,” “surviving,” or “triply op
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pressed.” They’ll urge sympathy on us for Black

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>as a class group, but never voice a criticism of
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Black women. It makes me wonder. When a
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>white woman assumes l’d be interested in some
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>thing just because l’m a Black person, I withdraw
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>one giant step inside. l’m dismayed when I see
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women at concerts or poetry readings knowing
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>how to clap in all the right places and saying a
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>nervous “yeah”—as if by verbal affirmation of

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>discharged and penance done so blame is de
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>flected from them.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Today, white women see a lot of Black women
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>who want to give their energy solely to Black
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women rather than deal with whites. I imagine
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>white women often don’t know what to do and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>feel perplexed. A good number of Black women
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>don’t want to be bothered teaching or working
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>with them because whites aren’t as innocent in
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>their racism as they put out. Others get mad at
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>whites for trying to include Black people. It seems
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>like you’re damned if you do and damned if you
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>don’t—so what’s a poor little white girl to do?
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>This thinking is, of course, not leading to the
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>real truth. I think the answer to the seeming
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>paradox is for the white women to do their own
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>consciousness-raising and examine what they
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>come up with among themselves. The working
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>out of racist attitudes is process work for white
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>women to do for themselves, with one another.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Once they can see themselves through the rough
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>stuff, they will actually be freer and truer to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>themselves. I appreciate that kind of honesty in
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>an individual more than a correct line. Honesty is
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>something I sense, can open up to and trust. Race
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>differences are real, but they’re not everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>We work out our real differences from honesty.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>But after they’ve done their own CR, I hope
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>these whites don’t come to me for a stamp of ap
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>proval. I’m having a hard enough time dealing
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>with my own stuff and hoping my women will give
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>me the pats on the back I crave. I don’t think
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>many Black women are going to credit whites for
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>doing their own homework. Whites seem to want
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>this at some level and when it doesn’t come, they
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>feel pissed and neglected. Well, that’s not enough
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>for Black women who have other concerns and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>don’t want to play nanny in any mode. l’ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>brought up to feel I should be grateful for every
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>little bit of progress, but I frankly do get angry at
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>white women who are actively trying to deal with
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>their racism and the new trips they lay on me in
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>their growth process. Those white women who
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>aren’t so anxious and eager to clean up their acts
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>and attitudes around race are the ones I can
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>have friendships with. It’s a tricky balance to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>find, but I think the important personal quality I
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>respond to is honesty.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>What is going on with all our concerns about
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>racism is, indeed, change. There is a willingness
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>among some white women to do some work, but
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>the transformation isn’t complete yet. Racist atti
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>tudes linger because the job isn’t all the way
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>done. People who haven’t seen that change is
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>possible can’t wholeheartedly believe in it. If
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_75' n='N075'/>they haven’t lived it in their personal lives, it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_76' n='N076'/>hard to see change in political terms. It won’t all
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_77' n='N077'/>come together in one fell swoop. After the major
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_78' n='N078'/>reconstruction, there will be corners to straight
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_79' n='N079'/>en out and the maintenance work will be a day
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_80' n='N080'/>to-day job. But this is Life Work. Any attempt to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_5_1_tl_81' n='N081'/>make it better can only come to good.

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>by the Venetian artist Danese Cattaneo, done in
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the mid-16th century—Black Venus. The full
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>length nude figure is bronze. In one hand she
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>holds a hand-mirror in which she is looking at
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>herself. On her head is a turban, around the

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>this work is a deeply personal interest, because
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>through these words and images I begin to cap
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ture part of who I am.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I should begin with my title—“Object into
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Subject.” What does it mean? We live in a society
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>whose history is drenched in the philosophy and
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>practice of racism, the oppression of Black and
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>other Third World peoples. This is the point at
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>which my definition begins: If you study racism
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>if you understand the history of the United States
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>—you will find that under racism the person who
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>is oppressed is turned into an object in the mind
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of the oppressor.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The white anti-racist southern writer Lillian
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Smith was among the first to offer a metaphysical

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>personal and political American practice.1 One
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>essential to the maintenance of things as they are
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in this society. Smith—whose influences included
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Kierkegaard, Jung, Freud, and Sartre—traced
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the origins of racism, and its more apparent
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>manifestation, segregation, to that place in the
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>human mind she called “mythic”: that place
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>where dreams, fantasies, and images begin;
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>where they continue and take form as art, litera
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ture, politics, religion. The mythic mind is e
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>source of psychic energy—it contributes the mo
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tion necessary for sustained thought. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mythic mind needs a structure in which to func
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tion, so that its products will be understood. This
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>structure is provided by reason. Reason, Smith
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>argued, is merely a technic, an enabler; its sole

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>purpose is to create the form which will support
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the ideas moving out of the mythic mind. Reason
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>is incapable of moral judgment, and therefore
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>will support any idea or image, regardless of its
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>moral basis.

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from which the myth takes its form—i.e., the

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>logical construct, is extremely important. She

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the film Birth of a Nation, introduced by a rather

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of a “tragic poet.” I had never seen the movie,

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would be recognizably insane. Once an object is

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ator, reveals herself as objectifier. This phenom
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>enon occurred over and again during the Civil
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Rights Movement. It was most commonly ex

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>liberation would not be achieved. What is pres
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ent is the need for whites to maintain power, and
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>limit the access of Black people to that power,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>which, finally, is the power of self-definition.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Imitation of Life, published in 1933, concerns
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the relationship between two dyads: a white
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>woman and her daughter and a Black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and her daughter. Both pairs are essentially
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>alone in the world. The Black woman, Delilah, is
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>hired to run the house by the white woman, Miss
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>B., who has been recently widowed. Delilah car
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ries with her various recipes, and these prove to
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>be the “salvation” of Miss B. and family. In a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>relatively short time, Miss B. is the proprietor of
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a chain of restaurants in which Delilah’s food is
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the main attraction, and which are recognized by
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>a likeness of Delilah on the sign. When Miss B.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>hits on the idea of photographing Delilah as the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>advertising gimmick for the enterprise, she
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dresses Delilah as a chef. Delilah, faithful ser

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a greasy dirty headrag; her too tight shoes from

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>she willingly and passively served....In a sense
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>whites created in the mammy figure a black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>who embodied solely those characteristics they as
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>colonizers wished to exploit.11
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>As Sapphires, black women were depicted as evil,

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>slave. Who was she? How did she survive? How
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>many of her did survive? What did she teach her
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>children? What was her relationship to her hus

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>She could be lynched, beaten, tortured, muti

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>away from her. She was forbidden education.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>She was considered a beast of burden. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>subject to the white man’s power and the white
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>woman’s powerlessness masking as whim. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>womb was a commodity of the slavemaster, and
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>her childlessness, a liability of the slavemaster.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>She was not expected to love—but she did. She
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>was not expected to run away—but she did. She

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>abortion rather than have her child be a slave.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>She was known to commit acts of violence and
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>rebellion—with magic, poison, force, even with
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>spit. And she sometimes learned to read and

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>with her.

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>In it, as in Raisin, Hansberry attempted to con

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>She didn’t work in the field. She worked at a loom.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>She worked so long and so often that once she went
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to sleep at the loom. Her master’s boy saw her and

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>up. When she woke up, she took a pole out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>loom and beat him nearly to death with it. He hol
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lered, “Don’t beat me no more, and I won’t let ’em
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>whip you.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>She said, “I’m going to kill you. These black titties
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>sucked you, and then you come out here to beat
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>me.” And when she left him, he wasn’t able to walk.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>And that was the last I seen of her until after free
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>dom. She went out and got an old cow that she used
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to milk—Dolly, she called it. She rode away from

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>This story tells of a Black woman in the act of
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>freeing herself. A selfish need for freedom, and a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>recognition that freedom is their right, is some
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>thing usually denied to Black women historically,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>even when they are recognized as liberators of

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>all felt a personal desire for freedom, which came
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>from a feeling of self-esteem, self-worth, and they
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>translated this into a political commitment that

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>marble, which supports the narrowness of the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>style—so that a black face must appear white
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and be carved according to principles of beauty
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>which are white, “fine” features as perfection.

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Of her sculpture Hagar (1875), Lewis said:“
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>have a strong sympathy for all women who have
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>struggled and suffered.”2 Again, we have to look
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>beyond the actual figure to the story Lewis is
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>illustrating to find the political/historical state
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ment in her work. Hagar was an Egyptian, a
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>woman of color, the slave of Abraham’s wife,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Sarah. Hagar was “given” to Abraham by Sarah
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>so that he might have an heir; and she was the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>mother of his first-born son, Ishmael. Then Isaac
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>was born to Abraham and Sarah. The book of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Genesis continues the story:
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>had borne to Abraham, playing with her son Isaac.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>So she said to Abraham, “Cast out this slave woman
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>with her son; for the son of this slave woman shall
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>not be heir with my son Isaac.” And the thing was
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>But God said to Abraham, “Be not displeased be
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>cause of the lad and because of your slave woman;
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>whatever Sarah says to you, do as she tells you, for
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>through Isaac shall your descendents be named....
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>So Abraham rose early in the morning... and sent
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>(Hagar) away. And she departed, and wandered in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the wilderness of Beer-sheba.21
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>It is quite impossible to read this story and not
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>think of the Black woman under slavery, raped

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>bearing the responsibility for that child—with no
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>power over her own fate, or that of her child.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Lewis’s choice of Hagar as a symbol for Black
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>slave-women also fits into the Black tradition in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>America, one immersed in the stories of the Bible
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>(often the Bible was the only access slaves had to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the written word), and characterized by the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>translation of these stories according to Black
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>history.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>In reading this account from Genesis, I am
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>also thrown back to Lillian Smith’s description of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the split between Black and white women. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Sarah who is made responsible for the banish
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ment of Hagar. Her husband and his god remain
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>blameless, even noble.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>After approximately ten years of recognition,

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>brown wood or terra cotta, or another material
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>which suggests the color of her subjects, or at
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>least that her subjects are people of color. No

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>political intent from Lewis’s Hagar. In form the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>differences are enormous: Hagar’s hands are
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>clasped in front of her, in resignation, in suppli
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>cation—in the wilderness she has to turn to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Abraham’s god to save the life of her son. The
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>female figure of Homage has one arm raised in a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>powerful and defiant fist. The similarity between
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the two pieces is that both, I think, represent part
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of the history of Black women, particularly Black
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>motherhood, in America. The midsection of the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Homage figure is an open space, which I take as
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Catlett’s statement of the historical white denial
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of Black women’s right to motherhood in any self

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Catlett uses the theme of Black women and

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and linocuts, Catlett seeks to tell the history of
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Black women, breaking away from the objectifi
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cation of the dominant culture. We might, for ex
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ample, look at her wood engraving of Harriet
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Tubman (1975), in contrast to Judy Chicago’&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Sojourner Truth plate in the Dinner Party.2 Cat
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>lett’s Harriet dominates the foreground; one pow
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>erful arm points forward, the other holds a rifle.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>She is tall and she is strong and she is Black. In
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the background are the men and women she
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>leads. What is interesting to me is the expression
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>on Tubman’s face—she is fiercely determined
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>This expression is repeated in the group she
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>leads. There is no passivity here, no resignation,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>no impotent tears, no “humming.” Rather, this is
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a portrait of the activity of a people in conflict
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>with their oppression.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Catlett has stated that art should be obviously
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>political, available to the people who are its sub
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ject. We have no such clear statement from
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Lewis, but we must wonder for whom her work
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was done, finally; and whether she stopped work-
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing as she did because of a distance between her
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>art and her subjects.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Harriet Powers (1837-1911) was a quilt-maker
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>(only two of her quilts are known to survive). She
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>worked in appliqué, a method of needlework de
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>vised by the Fon of Dahomey, brought to this
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>country on slave ships. Betye Saar is a collec
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tor; an artist who constructs images with various
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>objects, mementos, photographs, bits and pieces
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>picked up here and there and saved; things used
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in another context, by other hands. Both Powers
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and Saar endow their work with a belief in the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>spiritual nature of the ordinary. Powers’s quilts,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>constructed from the scraps saved by a poor
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Black woman, convey a real portrait of one Black
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>woman s religion and politics. Marie Jeane
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Adams states: “The more one examines the style
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and content of Harriet Powers’s work, the more
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>one sees that it projects a grand spiritual vision
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>that breaks out of the confines of folk art.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>The employment of once-used objects by these
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>artists is one aspect of their work which needs
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>further thought. In the history of white Western
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>art there is an obsession with the purity of mater
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ials. And also with their value. For one exam
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ple: In the art of 15th-century Italy, and even
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>earlier, the color ultramarine was often used to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>depict the most important figure or feature in a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>painting or fresco. This choice was made with
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the knowledge that the color was created by
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>crushing lapis lazuli, the most expensive source
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>of pigment after gold.25 And this choice extended
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>to the very meaning of the work produced. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>art of Powers and Saar, the sources of the artist&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>materials are also important, but the choice is
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>more deeply personal. We might ask: How much
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>does the power of a work of art consist in the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>material which makes up that work? What is the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>difference between a work of art made with
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>things specifically employed in that work and
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>never before, and one which uses only things
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>used before? Is one more useful than the other?
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>More magical than the other
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>We know of Harriet Powers’s work partly be-
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>cause of a white woman—Jennie Smith, herself
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>an artist—who left an 18-page monograph on the

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>Powers finally agreed to sell her a quilt:

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Adams observes, is the key to the quilt. Powers
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>left a description in her own words of all the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>scenes in the quilt; of this particular frame, she
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>said:
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Rich people who were taught nothing of God. Bob
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Johnson and Kate Bell of Virginia. They told their
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>parents to stop the clock at one and tomorrow it
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>would strike one and so it did. This was the signal
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>that they had entered everlasting punishment. The
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>independent hog which ran 500 miles from Ga. to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Va. Her name was Betts.28
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The frame has a clock in the center, stars and a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>moon scattered around, two human figures. At
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the bottom is the independent hog named Betts,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the largest figure of the quilt. Metallic thread
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>outlines the clockface and creates a tiara around
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the head of the white woman Kate Bell. Betts is
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>made from gray cloth, but she is placed over a

			<pb n='41'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>swatch of orange so that her figure unmistakably
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>stands out.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>This quilt represents a great spiritual vision,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>but it also represents a great political vision: as
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>well as hope, it represents rage. It is a safe guess
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>that Bob Johnson and Kate Bell of Virginia were a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>son and daughter of the slavocracy. They stand
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>surounded by scenes representing the punish
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ment meted out to those who are arrogant and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>self-serving, and the redemption promised those
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>who are righteous. In this particular frame it is
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>their sin of pride which has damned them; and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Powers is clear in her belief that their damnation
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>is well-earned. In contrast is the dominating fig
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ure of Betts, who in an act of self-liberation goes
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>free. Her 500-mile flight from Georgia to Virginia
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>is, as Adams points out, a reference to one route
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>traveled by runaway slaves. And Betts is undeni
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ably female—her teats hang down from her gray
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cloth body. I think of Dolly—the cow in the anec
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>dote cited above—being ridden away by a Black
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>woman. And I think of the white idea of Black

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>white folks. I take Betts to be a metaphor for this
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>experience. Angela Davis has quoted Frederick
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Law Olmstead’s description of a slave crew in
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Mississippi returning from the fields:
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>[I saw) forty of the largest and strongest women !
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ever saw together; they were all in a simple uniform
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dress of a bluish check stuff; their legs and feet
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>were bare; they carried themselves loftily, each
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>having a hoe over the shoulder, and walking with a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>free, powerful swing like chausseurs on the march.29
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>It would be very simple to romanticize this
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>group of women. But, as Davis says, it is not slav
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ery and the slave system that have made them
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>strong; it is the experience of their labor and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>their knowledge of themselves as producers anc
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>creators. She quotes Marx: “labor is the living,

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>things, their temporality. Davis makes a brilli
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ant connection here:
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>...perhaps these women had learned to extract
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>from the oppressive circumstances of their lives the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>strength they needed to resist the daily dehumani
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>zation of slavery. Their awareness of their endless
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>capacity for hard work may have imparted to them
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a confidence in their ability to struggle for them
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>selves, their families and their people. 30
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Black women were not dehumanized under slav-
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ery; they were dehumanized in white minds. I re-
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>turn again and again in my own mind to the ad
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>jective “independent, which Powers uses to de
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>scribe Betts, a “chasseur on the march.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>It is not that far a distance from Lewis&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Hagar, to Catlett’s Homage, to Powers’s Betts, to
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Betye Saar’s Aunt Jemima. Saar’s construction,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>entitled The Liberation of Aunt Jemima, is per
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>haps the most obvious illustration of what I mean
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>by the title of this essay: “Object into Subject.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Here is the most popularized image of the Mammy
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>—in the center of the piece she is a cookie jar,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the source of nourishment for others; behind her
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>are faces cut from the pancake mix. In front of
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the central figure is another image of Mammy,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>holding a white baby. And there is a broom along
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>side the central figure. But she also holds a pistol
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and a rifle; and the skirt of Mammy with the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>white baby forms an unmistakable Black fist.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Saar’s message is clear: Aunt Jemima will free
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>herself.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>In an interview in Black Art, Saar described
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the components she uses in her work:
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>They are all found objects or discarded objects, so
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>they have to be remnants. They are connected with
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>another sensitivity so it has to be a memory of be
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>longing to another object, or at least having another
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>function. 31
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Aunt Jemima has been created by another sensi
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tivity than that of the artist who has made this
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>portrait. Aunt Jemima has a memory of belonging
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to someone else, of being at the service of some
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>one else. She exists against an image, which
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>exists in another mind. The cookie jar is a rem
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>nant of another life: most likely she “lived” on the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>kitchen counter of a white family, maybe Saar
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>found her discarded on a white elephant table, or
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>at a garage sale. She has appeared to me in my
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>travels, usually turning up in rural antique stores
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>or church basements, labeled “collectible. The
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>picture of Mammy with the white baby reminds
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>me first of old magazine advertisements, usually,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>as I recall, for soap or cereal or other necessities
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of the servant role. And I additionally recall the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>many films of the ’40s and ’50s about white middle
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>class America, in which a large Black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>who worked in the kitchen was always present
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>but only occasionally given a line to speak. She
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>was played by Louise Beavers, Hattie McDaniel,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>or Ethel Waters—and she was usually charac
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>terized by her loyalty to the white family for
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>whom she worked. She also appeared on televi-
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>sion: “Beulah” was a program in which she was
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>featured. She was kind, honest, a good cook,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>always with a song to hum her troubles away;
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>and as usual, devoted to those white folks.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>All but three of the elements in Saar’s con
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>struction are traditional to Aunt Jemima; the two
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>guns and the fist are not. Saar, by including these
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>unfamiliar aspects has changed the function of
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>the figure she is representing. She has combined
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>the myth with the reality of Black women s his
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>toric opposition to their oppression.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>This representation of Aunt Jemima is star
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>tling. All of us who have grown up with the mythi-
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>cal figure of Aunt Jemima and her equally mythi
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>cal attributes—whether or not we recognized
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>they were mythic—have been affected. We may
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>not have known her, but aren’t we somehow con-
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>vinced that somewhere she exists, or at least has
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>existed? The last thing we would expect would be
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_75' n='N075'/>that she would carry a gun, or raise a hand. As a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_76' n='N076'/>child in Jamaica I was taught that the women
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_5_1_tl_77' n='N077'/>who worked for us were to be respected and

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>me—and my mother backed her up. Just as I was
				<lb facs='#facs_42_l_2311' n='N006'/>shocked to find that another houseworker had

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>is it really true what they say about colored pussy?
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>come on now
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dont be trying to act like you dont know what i am talking about
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>you have heard those stories about colored pussy so stop pretending you
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>havent
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>you have heard how black and latina pussies are hot and uncontrollable
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and i know you know the one about asian pussies and how they go from
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>side to side instead of up and down
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and everybody knows about squaw pussies and how once a whiteman got
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>him some of that he wasnt never no more good
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>now at first i thought the logical answer to these stories is that they are
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ignorant racist myths
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>but then i thought: what about all the weird colored stories about
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>colored pussy?
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cuz you know colored pussies werent always treated with the highest
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>regard we deserve in the various colored worlds prior to our
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>discovery by the european talentscout/explorers
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and we still arent
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>so now why is it that colored pussies have had to suffer so much oppression
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and bad press from so many divergent sources?
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>is it cuz we really are evil and nasty and queer looking and smelly and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ugly like they say?
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>is it cuz we possess some secret strength which we take for granted but
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>which is a terrible threat to the various forces which are trying
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to suppress us?
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>i mean just look at what black pussies have been subjected to alone
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>starting with ancient feudal rape and polygamy and clitoridectomy
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and forced child marriages and continuing right on through colonial
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>industrial neocolonial rape and forced sterilization and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>experimental surgery
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and when i put all that stuff about black pussies together with the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>stories i hear from other colored pussies about what they have had
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to go through i am even more convinced
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>we must have some secret powers!
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>this must be why so many people have spent so much time vilifying
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>abusing hating and fearing colored pussy
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and you know that usually the ones who be doing all this vilifying
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>abusing hating and fearing of colored pussy are the main ones who
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>just cant leave colored pussy alone dont you
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>they make all kinds of laws and restrictions to apartheid-ize colored
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>pussy and then as soon as the sun goes down guess who is seen
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>sneaking out back to the cabins?
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and guess who cant do without colored pussy in their kitchens and fields
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>and factories and offices?
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>then theres the people who use colored pussy as a badge of certification
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>to ensure entre into certain circles
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>finally when i think about what would happen if all the colored pussies
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>went on strike even for a day
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>look out!

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>There was the estrangement from my son, of

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>coming expensive. Jung had said that series of
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>dreams were far more informative than dreams

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>A prison camp, like the Nazi concentration

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rapt attention. The words seem very significant
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>(but I can’t remember them). She goes over to
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>straighten out details of the show with the musi
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>cians, a signal that it is time for me to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>packing. When I ask someone about the singer,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>l’m told she is an off-duty policewoman. I marvel
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>at this, and feel the police are no longer as bad
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>as people think. I finish packing, and go outside
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to get a cab.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Suddenly I have many relatives with me.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mama, and the various aunts. They are supposed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to be helping me with my bags, but they really
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>don’t. When we hail a cab, Dan Goldberg comes
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>along driving a gorgeous antique, fully outfitted
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>as the living room of a European country house
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>on wheels. Mama and the others are fascinated
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>by the decor and climb in.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>First I put the small suitcase inside, and thenI
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>have to go back for the big one. I return carrying
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>it on my back. Bent over under the load, I think:
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>“That’s interesting. I would have expected it to
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>be much heavier. Perhaps that&apos;s the best way to
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>carry heavy loads. On your back. It distributes
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the weight more evenly than carrying them by
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>hand
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>I dump the suitcase into the cab, still filled
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>with relatives, and climb in. Danny is in a good
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>mood. I tell him to put the meter on, because I
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>know he’s been waiting a long time. We drive off.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N010'/>—No—I answer, slowly, carefully, truthfully—not as far as I know. But I was
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N011'/>very close to a West Indian woman when I was a child.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N012'/>My mother, asking, after my son and I came back from London: Do all of Gerardo’s English
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N013'/>friends have those wonderful rosy cheeks?
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N014'/>—Well, not exactly. Most of them are West Indian.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N015'/>She laughs: You know, Ethel, our old cook down in Panama, was from Jamaica. You took
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N016'/>your first steps toward her. She was a big, tall woman, you used to hang on to one of her legs
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N017'/>—she had huge legs—and she’d carry you around the kitchen that way. You wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N018'/>let go..
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N019'/>Now there was a daughter and her mother living all alone in the bush. They lived in
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N020'/>a tree. And when the mother went out hunting, she would leave porridge and dried
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N021'/>meat hanging in the tree.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N022'/>...Ethel was a very dark woman, but she had a light-skinned daughter named Elma who was
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N023'/>married to a very black man. When you were following Ethel around the kitchen, she used to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N024'/>say, She laihk my Elma, she laihk de blahk skin.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N025'/>The chief sent his men to carry the daughter away, but the mother returned in that
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N026'/>moment and dropped down into the tree, singing:
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N027'/>Many as you are, I will stitch you with the big needle.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N028'/>And they died. All of them died.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N030'/>But one day a dove came to tell the mother that her daughter had been carried off
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N031'/>to the village. She knew, she already knew, and already she was coming down the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N032'/>path, carrying a pot full of magic powders and swinging a whisk made from a zebra

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N034'/>—Tell me more about Ethel.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N035'/>— Oh, Ethel? Well, you know, she was very superstitious. She was always dreaming num
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N036'/>bers for the lottery: Mistress! Mistress! l’ve dreamed! she’d say. And then she’d tell me—oh,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N037'/>all about her dreams. She loved you so much. I remember you never wanted to eat with us.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N038'/>She used to cook herself West Indian food—she ate in a little anteroom off the kitchen—and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N039'/>you never wanted to eat with us, you always wanted to go in there and eat West Indian food
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N040'/>with Ethel. She’d say: Mistress, she laihk de blahk food.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N041'/>She stood over the spot where her daughter had sunk into the ground. She took the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N042'/>pot full of magic powders and began to blow on them

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N048'/>Whoo-oo

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Five years. That’s right. 1929—five years since that damn law. Time passes
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>quickly.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Perhaps it passed quickly for married men like you, Yasuda, but for bache
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>lors like me it passes slowly. And do not forget California has laws forbid
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ding marriage with hakujins. We have had little hope for the future and for
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>having families. We’re watching Matsuda. He is the first to try this.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>It is different, isn’t it, Ito? Different from running away with other men’s
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>wives. That’s all you young men have tried to do so far, isn’t it? Yes, all of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>us married Japanese are happy to see that Matsuda married.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Tak smiled. It’s true Matsuda is a flashy one. Almost like a Filipino.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The women think so too, eh Ito said, Ken nodding his head. Lotsa younger
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>wives have a weakness for Japanese men who act more like Filipinos than
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>like Japanese. What can a man who’s fifteen years older than his wife do?
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>There are so many unattached younger men around.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>That’s why you keep me out in that shack Tak thought to himself. Afraid to

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Yasuda, those damn laws are hard on us all he spoke aloud. We will all
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>watch Matsuda and his wife to see how things go with them.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Tell me, Ito, what do you think of Matsuda marrying a kurumbo? I don’t like
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the mixing of races like that myself. Never liked it when Japanese chased
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>after hakujin women. It’s a Filipino thing to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I don’t know, Yasuda. I have never known a kurumbo. Never talked to one.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>They seem a strange people.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>When I came to America, Ito, Japanese had to work on farms owned by
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>hakujins. Young men like you now can work for other Japanese. Back then
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>there might be a kurumbo or two working with us. Mostly there were poor
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>hakujins called hobozu I think. A few Mexicans and Filipinos. Some Chinese
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and few kurumbos. I did not get to know them. The owners hired mostly one
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>nationality at a time. If they changed they changed everyone.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>And me, I worked hard saving money to marry and to buy this land I now
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>own in my son’s name. They made it hard for us, these hakujin laws. Laws
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to stop our coming. Laws to not marry. Laws to not own land. But we found
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ways to do these things. I worked hard. I had no time to spend or money to
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>waste like the wilder Japanese. No time to get rowdy and drink and sing
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with Mexicans and kurumbos. Anyway most of us stayed with our kind.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Left the others alone. Matsuda is like those wild ones back then. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>understand this marriage Kenji said, shaking his head.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>If it weren’t for the children she thought I would have left long ago. Giving
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>up my children is too hard. Ah men! Always mysterious and confusing.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Outside Fumi carried Jun piggyback. His laughs distracted Masako. Smiling
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>she waved to them.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Yes, yes, Tetsuo, for the children I stayed. Sighing softly she remembered
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the rare moments they spent together. Her body recalled Tetsuo’s caresses,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sometimes gentle, at others forceful. Arousing then satisfying her. The feel
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of his hands stroking her through the cloth of her clothes or of his fingers
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lightly brushing the inside of her thighs.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Those were fine moments. Tetsuo, I never spoke with you about Kenji, so
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>awkward compared to you. Either hesitant, as if he is unsure of me or of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>himself perhaps. Or roughly pulling at me, pressing me down with his
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>weight to be sure of his possession of me.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Shaking her head she thought to herself. I am never to know why. My hus
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>band never talks to me. Is it possible to love someone one does not under
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>stand?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>But then, Tetsuo, you were always a mystery too. Fumi and Jun were an
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>excuse. My marriage was arranged by my family. With you Tetsuo, came
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>my first opportunity to choose for myself. I found I did not know how to
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>make my own choice. What did I want? How was I to decide? And who was
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Ito ask for help? You, Tetsuo? I never understood you either. Why you did
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>things. Can I say I knew you or you me?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>And now, Tetsuo, you are married. A strange wife you have brought back
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with you. Is she able to penetrate your shell? And I am surprised, Tetsuo, I
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>do not hate her. Is this because I felt no claim on you beyond one on your
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>body? Or because I gave no more of myself?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Mama! Mama! she heard Fumiko calling to her. Mama, we’re hungry! Will
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>dinner be ready soon? Yes, Fumi-chan Masako called out to the yard. l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>putting the rice on now. She hurried to get the rice. Pumping water into the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>pan, she rinsed away the rice’s glutinous covering. Each time she filled the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>pan the water became less cloudy and was poured into a pail to later water
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the garden. If only my thoughts and my understanding could become clear-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>er as you do, water. I would rinse and rinse and think and rethink if only I
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>thought it possible. When the water remained clear, she measured fresh
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>water into the pan up to the first knuckle of her smallest finger and added a
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>pinch of salt
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>As she had stoked the fire when she first came in from the fields, the rice
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>began to cook right away. Masako watched as the water bubbled and
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>gained momentum into a boil. Her thoughts returned to Matsuda’s wife.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>What will you feed Tetsuo? Can you cook rice? Will he teach you to prepare
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the osushi and the misoshiro he loves to eat? Or will he come to love the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>food your people eat? And what food do you eat? Our food is so different
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>from hakujin food. It is strange to go into their markets and see the odd
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>things they sell there. How will you feel in a Japanese market? A stranger
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>in both places? I know so little. But if you know him and he you perhaps you
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>will come to know the things the other has lived with. I wish I could know.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>That night as Masako sat combing her hair her thoughts returned to Matsu
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>da’s wife. l’d like to talk to her. l’d like to ask her if she understands him.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>My life has not prepared me to understand men. Perhaps hers has. Per
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>haps she can tell me.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>It will be difficult for her among us. We Japanese are not an open-minded
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>people. It is easy for me to sit here wondering about her and wanting to ask
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>her questions. And yet another matter for me to go and talk with her. Could
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>I do it? Will any of us welcome her? It’s difficult to imagine. What would I
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>say to her? Tetsuo knows some English. Probably they speak in English. l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>wanted to learn to speak English too. If I could I might go talk with her. But
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>my husband does not want me to learn. It is because we women don’t get
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>opportunities to speak with Americans and thereby to learn that we stay
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>dependent on our husbands. But will Tetsuo teach his wife Japanese? If he
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>doesn’t, won’t she be as lonely as I am? Lonelier even. Who other than
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Tetsuo will she have to talk with?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>She imagined herself trying to talk to or to approach this woman. Heyro.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Mah namae Masako. How far could our conversation go? The questions I
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>want to ask delve deep into me and into her, I would think. I am barely able
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>to introduce myself. It is a hopeless thought to imagine conversation. And
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>do I really want to know Tetsuo now? Now that he belongs to another?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>What meaning would it have for me to understand him—the husband of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>another woman—among men?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Masako her husband’s hoarse whisper came from across the room. Masako
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>he said, walking up behind her. He began running his fingers through her
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>hair. Masako, you are so beautiful...She felt the roughness of his hands
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>stroking her arms. Kenji buried his face in her hair. She had just washed it
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>and he breathed deeply her fragrance. Rubbing his face back and forth in
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>its coolness, he felt the heaviness of her hair in his hands. Masako! Masako!
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>Come with me. Come with me. You are so beautiful, so beautiful.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>Feeling Kenji’s weight upon her, Masako let out a moan. Through the win-
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>dow she saw the sky clear of clouds and the night at its darkest black. Stars
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>twinkled in it like a field full of fireflies. Across the field was the Matsuda
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>house. There too the lights went out. Who is this woman, Matsuda’s wife?
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>she asked herself. Does she understand better than I

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Growing up, when I looked in the mirror, I used to see a skinny little
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>girl, with slanted eyes and dark coppery skin, and I was pleased. I had not
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>yet learned that dusky color would lock me in a prison for which there was
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>no key
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Much of my childhood, I was protected from obvious racial slights be
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cause Momma thought the world of her pretty brown baby, and Grandma
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>too. They worked hard, Momma and Gram, and they provided me with
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>examples of the realities of being a Black woman. Momma always told me
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in verbal and other ways, that I was important, that I was as good as “any
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>body” and better than most.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>During my adolescence, many Black people, insecure about their own
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>self-worth, projected their fears onto me and other dark brothers and sis
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ters. It made our lives miserable. All too often, I would overhear people
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>remark to Mama: “Such a pretty child, with such long hair, too bad she’s
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>so Black!” My soul cringes even now, whenever I remember those careless
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>remarks that hurt so much.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>In my later teens, I rebelled because of the limited societal and cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>roles dictated for a Black woman. White society and Black culture are still
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>defining roles for women and Black people. They are ever-enduring, long-
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>suffering, supportive, nurturing, mothers, sisters, aunts, grandmothers,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and wives. The common thread is dependency. The roles identified as “ap
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>propriate” are narrow and restrictive. They would not let me live up to my
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>full creative potential.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Now, I am careful about my life. I know I am not finished; there are
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>several choices I have yet to make, and many things I have not experienced.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>I am still in process, giving rebirth to myself. My life, connected to Gram’s
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and Mama’s, is a work in progress—a great Black woman’s tapestry that I
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>am working on. What a legacy these women have left me. I still experience
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>deep bitterness and frustration as I struggle against oppression to make my
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>voice heard. I rage against the injustices that wore my grandmother down,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and limited Mama’s life to one of survival. I rage for Gram, Mama, and me.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The lessons they have taught me, these strong, tough, loving women, are a

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cotton dress to register for freshman classes. I was paying my own tuition
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and I could not afford the expense of Central State or Wilberforce, colleges
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>for Negro youth. I knew little about my family’s roots except that my grand
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mother had come North under strain. A white landowner had run her hus
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>band off their small farm and my grandfather had been told to choose the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>land or his life. Then, this same white man had come to my grandmother
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and insisted that she become his mistress. “I told you that Charlie wasn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>no good. Go with me and l’Il help you raise your girls,” he said. Grand
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>mother, a Seminole African Negro, did not believe in submitting to white
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>racism and so she managed to bring her four girls up North. In her maturity,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>my mother had married my father, a steelmill worker. I was the first child
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>from my mother’s side to attend college.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Chewing on a brown pipe, a white professor said, “English departments
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>do not hire Negroes or women!” Like a guillotine, his voice sought to take
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>my head off. Racism in my hometown was an economic code of etiquette
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>which stifled Negroes and women.

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>catalogue, I went outside for relief.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>English departments do not hire Negroes or women” echoed inside my
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>head. After eating a baloney sandwich in the cafeteria, I returned to regis
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ter. Another staff person enrolled me.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>After graduation from the upper third of an elite white school, I had
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>worked as a page in the public library to pay my tuition on installment plan.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Pages shelved books, cleaned fingerprints, and checked out books for
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>librarians. Many white workers resented my presence and refused to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>speak to me. On my breaks I started reading the new books about the Civil
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Rights Movement. I planned to read my way past the bigots in the English
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>department. All Negro authors were excluded from the English curriculum,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>but I found some of them in the library.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Negro women were rare in the library. Mrs. Elsie Lee, a graduate of
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Tuskegee University, told me that I could not make any mistakes. She was a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>gentle woman who reminded me of the Negro teachers I had as a child. My
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>second and third grade teachers taught me to read independently. My
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>father’s sister stressed that I should always be independent. These women
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>protected me. “I have a librarian’s degree, but they will only let me work as
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>a clerk typist,” Mrs. Lee confided one day. I felt more anger.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Hostile white attitudes often permeated my dreams. Frankenstein, a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>stumbling white man, emerged from a coffin to haunt me. “Whiteness

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>suggested that I get married. To counter my nightmares about racism, I
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>joined the campus NAACP chapter and then I took a job typing at the adult
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>branch of the NAACP. Although I enjoyed talking to people who discussed

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>One day I was doing a mailing for the loc
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>NAACP chapter and a tall,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Lena-Horne-looking woman walked into their office. Wearing a blue negli
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>gee, she stood in satin blue slippers.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>“T’m cold,” she whined.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Her name was Cora Emerson and her father had owned the first Negro
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>funeral parlor in our town. The NAACP rented a room from the Emerson
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>mansion. Cora’s parents were dead and she missed the company of Negroes.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“You don’t have any clothes on,” remarked Mr. Lee, the NAACP pres
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ident.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I jotted down their exchange, which became a short story later. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>writing about conflict because my mother was demanding that I pay our
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>rent. She and my father had separated without him providing child support
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>or alimony. I was barely able to pay our rent and my tuition. Typing brought
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>me extra money, but completing college seemed remote.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>After working late one evening, I left to walk home. White cab drivers
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>did not drive into Negro neighborhoods and they would not let Negroes
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>drive cabs. Angry, I thought about my dinner which my two brothers al
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ways ate before I arrived home. Cora called out to me and invited me to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>stay with her for the school year. She was lonely.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I accepted Cora’s offer and left my mother’s home. Seated on a chaise
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lounge, Cora told me many stories about our race. Her legal mother was
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>white-looking, but would not have sexual relations with her wealthy hus
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>band. Mr. Emerson had taken a mistress and had Cora by her. Mrs. Emer
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>son was forced to raise Cora and adopted a son. After Fisk University, a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>medical doctor for a husband, and concubinage to a rich white man, Cora
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>had returned home to drink. Those were my options—to look white, to marry
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>a professional, or to suffer, according to Cora. Her words injured me more
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>deeply than the racist professor who hated Negroes and women. She said,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>“Negroes have to go to schools like Fisk. You’Il never get out of a white
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>college. You’re a pretty brown. My step-mother sent me with two trunks of
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>clothes and a fur coat. I was the only woman with a full-length mink coat in
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>90 degree weather.” Her words stung me and I wrote a term in my journal
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>—mulatto racism. This was white bigotry transformed into an art among
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>middle-class, European-looking Negroes.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>As the years passed, I became aware of a link between racism and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sexism. Teachers in English departments would teach Ibsen’s A Doll’s
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>House to analyze the degradation of women. However, they would not give
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>me credit for reading Richard Wright’s Native Son because white men
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>feared any images of a Black man and a white woman together. I could
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>understand imagery of white women, for they were seldom excluded from
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>literature. For example, Nathaniel Hawthorne’s “The Birthmark” por
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>trayed man’s love for science, which rivaled his love of woman after elec-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tricity was discovered. Hawthorne portrayed a scientist who killed his
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>obedient wife by removing a birthmark to make her a perfect woman. His
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>story predicted white Western man’s affair with technology which has led
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to much human destruction. White women were feeling this symbolic death
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and depersonalization when Black women were combatting racism.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>We read Hemingway’s A Farewell to Arms in which men were “preg-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>nant” with bullets and the heroine died in childbirth. I was sensitive to how
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>harmful technology had become because of the anti-war movement on cam
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>pus. Yet literature did not reflect the destruction I was experiencing.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Richard Wright’s The Long Dream came the closest to expressing some of
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>my reality. A Black male father with a white-looking mistress showed his
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>son the body of a castrated Black man. His father tried to teach him to have
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>sex with women as “whitish” as possible, but to avoid the blacker-skinned
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>woman. He said, “Son, there ain’t nothing a white woman’s got that a black
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>woman ain’t got. ... When you in the presence of a white woman, remem-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>ber she means death.” Ironically, our integrated Civil Rights Movement
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>became middle-class white women’s opportunity to fight racism and to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>mate with Black men. Black women who did not have sex-role problems in
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>the Black community had racist white women conflicts. My grandmother
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>saw white men castrate Black men, but I witnessed my white friends setting
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>up remedial reading programs to seduce older, illiterate Black men.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>The women in our student NAACP chapter started reading more Negro
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>authors. How had decent white people and some Negroes acquired hateful
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>feelings about our race and sex? I turned to Richard Wright’s Twelve Mil
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>lion Black Voices, Dr. Du Bois’ Black Reconstruction, James Baldwin’s The
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>Fire Next Time, and Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun. Then the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>library purchased Gwendolyn Brooks’ poetry, Margaret Walker’s works,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>Dr. King’s speeches, and authors called “protest writers.” These writers
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>indicted the African slave trade, racism, and economic discrimination for
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>the condition of Negroes. All of them described an alienation from the land
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>of our birth. Some of the women like me cut our hair into “Afros” and wore
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_75' n='N075'/>African clothing. We bought Nina Simone and Miriam Makeba records. We
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_76' n='N076'/>tried to blacken our “double consciousness” which Dr. Du Bois examined in
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_77' n='N077'/>Souls of Black Folks. Feeling like a Negro and an American was a strife that
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_78' n='N078'/>could tear our souls apart. I felt that tension.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_79' n='N079'/>Because Black and white protest writers lessened my despair, I con
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_80' n='N080'/>tinued to search for their writings. I found books with poems and essays

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>William C. Bryant, and Walt Whitman. One of the librarians, a German
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>from World War II, encouraged me to read and to remain in college. She
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>was more honest about race hatred than a white female instructor who

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>for students. The link between racism and sexism surfaced again. While

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>faculty from the university, a Black male priest tried to exploit us sexually.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>easily make friends with younger writers. LeRoi Jones/Amiri Baraka an

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>his rape-the-white-woman lines. Needless to say, I became more interested
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>in feminism. We moved to New York City and I applied to Columbia’s School
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>of the Arts. I became friends with Kgositsile and read African writers like
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Buchi Emecheta. In the meantime, my husband had withdrawn funds from

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>short stories, and a novel. One day a fiction instructor said, “Don’t write
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>about Negroes. James Baldwin has already done that theme.” Frank Polite,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>a poet with a bread and wine disposition, had taught me that honesty was

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>African and Caribbean authors to the curriculum. I could not understand
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>middle-class Black insanity. The Black administrators preferred to assist
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>middle-class foreign students from the Third World. These students were
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>arrogant tutors and they were hired by Miss Lawrence, the coordinator of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>English. When I resumed my studies at Columbia, Miss Lawrence was
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>furious. Oddly, my success with Black students made me the target of Black
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>insanity. Every obstacle was placed in my path. I enrolled in a fiction class
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>with Paule Marshall, the West Indian novelist. Miss Lawrence thought that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>she had scheduled me so I would have to miss studying with the author of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Brown Girl, Brownstones. I sketched a journal question: “Which is worse
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Black insanity or white racism?&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Our Black insanity warfare was unbelievable. I left NYU, earned a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Master’s on Black writers, and wrote a text at Teacher’s College. That text,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>English for People Who Hate English, served to get me an interview to teach
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in the CUNY system.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>When many of my male students argued that neither Nanny nor Leafy in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God had been raped, I
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>knew that male supremacy was retarding male development at York Col-
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>lege. Male supremacy repressed thought in academia. For example, my
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Nigerian chairman did not know my references—John O. Killens and Gwen-
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>dolyn Brooks. Yet, as I taught, he respected my ability and supported me
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>when Black male students protested against my feminist critique.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Black women felt the violation of Nanny and Leafy in very personal
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>ways. They cried for Nanny and despised Leafy. Several women said that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>they hated having to look like their oppressor, the white woman, to be con-
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>sidered beautiful by Black men. In addition, native New Yorkers had mixed
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>feelings about Leafy’s daughter, Janie. Brown- and black-skinned women
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>with wooly hair said that they were tired of losing Black men to mulatto
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>women, Latin women, and Asian women. Ironically, they liked to identify
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>with Janie because darker women had a chance to experience being de
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>sired by Black men.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>Women in the class observed how the wife of a slavemaster had beaten
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>Nanny and had said this battering was one cause of hostility between white
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>and Black women. Could white women encourage sexism in white men?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>The white wife said to Nanny, “Ah wouldn’t dirty mah hands on yuh. But
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>first thing in de mornin’ de overseer will take you to the whippin’ post and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>tie you down on yo’ knees and cut de hide offa yo’ yaller back.” Not only did
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>slave women have to tolerate rape by owners, but they also had to bear the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>jealous rages of white wives.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_75' n='N075'/>The rights of male supremacy were so upheld that the Black men ex
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_76' n='N076'/>cused the rape of Leafy, Nanny’s blonde child. Didn’t the marriage pro
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_77' n='N077'/>posal revoke the schoolteacher’s use of force on this blonde virgin? Their
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_78' n='N078'/>Eyes allowed us a way to discuss sexism. Black or white men could brutal
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_79' n='N079'/>ize a “fox” like Leafy, for she was a bastard. Several Black men said that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_80' n='N080'/>they could dominate bastards like Leafy and Janie more easily than darker
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>women. Janie was not a feminist; she would bow.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Caribbean women were more open to a critique of male supremacy and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>more oblivious to racism. In a 1938 essay, “Women in the Caribbean,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Hurston wrote: “Naturally women do not receive the same educational
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>advantages as men. This sex superiority is further complicated by class
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and color ratings. But if a woman is wealthy, of good family and mulatto,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she can overcome some of her drawbacks. But if she is of no particular
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>family, poor and black, she is in a bad way indeed in that man’s world.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Caribbean women helped Black American students to see sex as a meta
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>phor for power. Thus, to discuss the element of conquest in sex was not to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>be disloyal to Black men. I argued that Hurston probably felt more free to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>examine sexism in the Caribbean. Their men protested less.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I raised this question of sex as a metaphor for power in a Caribbean
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>literature class, as well as Folklore, Negritude, and Black Church classes.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Since there were no white students present, we were able to analyze
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>authors of African descent. Three women had given us insight into the par
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ticular kind of sexism our men practice. They prefer European-looking
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>women. Hurston’s “Women in the Caribbean,” Gwen Brooks’ Maud Martha,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and Paule Marshall’s essay “To Da-duh, In Memoriam” explained that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women with African features have been made neuter by slavery and that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>they have been kept defeminized by bigoted attitudes in our families.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Most of the men in literature about people of African descent have a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>racist male-supremacist outlook on women and life. To show that they have
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>status, some men want white women. This was why a man like Frederick
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Douglass, who married a white feminist, was resented by the Black women
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of his day. Oddly, Ida B. Wells’ acceptance of Douglass’ second wife caused
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>him to support her anti-lynching campaign, but Ida came to understand the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>racist nature of Black male sexism when Dr. Du Bois humiliated her at the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>founding of the NAACP. (He refused to read her name on the list of NAACP
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>founders.) The white woman had become the ultimate power symbol to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>some men. Thus, Ida B. Wells wrote about Mary White Ovington, who
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>served as chairman of the NAACP executive committee. She said: “She has
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>basked in the sunlight of adoration of the few college-bred Negroes who
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>have surrounded her, but has made little effort to know the soul of a Black
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>woman; and to that extent she has fallen far short of helping a race which
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>has suffered as no white woman has ever been called upon to suffer or to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>understand. I cannot resist the conclusion that, had I not been so hurt over
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the treatment I had received at the hands of the men of my own race and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>thus blinded to the realization that I should have taken the place which the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>white men of the committee felt I should have, the NAACP would now be a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>live, active force in the lives of our people all over the country.” The power
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>of a white woman in a social change group rendered an early Black femi
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>nist powerless. I stopped wondering why Black American women suspected
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the Women’s Movement, for Ida’s wounds were still bleeding.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>There are many women, however, actively fighting racism in the Wom
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>en’s Movement. Dr. G. Berger of the Brooklyn College Institute of Women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Studies for Secondary School Faculty is one such woman. Because so many
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>students in New York City are of Black and Hispanic origins, Dr. Berger
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>hired me and a Puerto Rican feminist to teach the literature of Black and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Hispanic women. Some of the white feminists resisted our curriculum. They
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>said that the high schools would not allow them to teach feminist writers.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Also, a few women did not want Black or Latin teachers. My colleague did
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>not have sufficient enrollment and so she lectured on Hispanic women writ
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ers in my class, which was overcrowded. At the end of the summer course,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>most students said that they enjoyed Chase-Riboud’s Sally Hemings, Hur
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ston’s Their Eyes, Audre Lorde’s poetry, Hansberry’s essay on the Adolf
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Eichmann trial, Alice Walker’s Meridian, Ntozake Shange’s For Colored
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Girls, and other Black women’s voices.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>A few Latin women and white men were very supportive and argued
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>that they would struggle to change conservative curriculums in the public
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>schools. The three Black women in the course said that they had learned
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>about the Black woman’s vision, but criticized feminism for not strengthen
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>ing the family. One poem everyone liked was written by Gabriela Mistral.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>Yo no quiero que a mi nina/ la vayan hacer princesa
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>(“I do not wish that my daughter/grows up to become a princess.”)
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>I marvelled at the progressive thought of Latin and Caribbean women.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>Were it not for fiction writers like Zora Neale Hurston, some Black writers
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>would be behind our sisters of color.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>Many years ago, an American literature professor had cursed the des-
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>tiny of “Negroes and women.” There was truth in his ugly words. Have you
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>ever had a Black woman for an English teacher in the North? Few of us are
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>able to earn a living. For the past few years, I have worked as an adjunct in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>English. Teaching brings me great satisfaction; starving does not. Ironically,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_75' n='N075'/>publishing houses are saying that they are not going to publish Black writ-
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_76' n='N076'/>ers anymore. As I revise the second draft of my novel, I still remember the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_77' n='N077'/>red color of the face which said, “English departments do not hire Negroes
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_78' n='N078'/>or women.” Can women change this indictment? These are the fragments I

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_16_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I opened my eyes at the sound of a radio placed in the sand

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>In the second novel, it goes like this:

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>ly of what happened, and what happened is one
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>of the most important insights in the books

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>is because it is so unusual for a woman as light

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>all. He just slapped her around a bit to show he

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the fields. It aroused a sort of envy in both men
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and wômen. The way he petted and pampered

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>An astute reader would realize that this is the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>real reason Tea Cake is killed by Janie in the end.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>cutting the master’s throat. But never desired or
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>romantically loved, because she does not care for
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>aesthetic&quot; suffering. Sexual titillation is out, be

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>so readily, and besides, she lets you know she

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>drawn to write about a black black woman be-
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>cause he was so black himself, and blackness
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>was a problem for him among other blacks lighter
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>than himself, as it was among whites. We can
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>continue to respect and love many of these writ
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ers, and treasure what they wrote because we
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>understand America; but we must be wary of
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>their depictions of black women because we
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>understand ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>In his landmark essay “Of the Dawn of Free
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dom” (1903), W.E.B. Du Bois wrote: “The problem
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of the twentieth century is the problem of the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>color-line—the relation of the darker to the light
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>er races of men in Asia and Africa, in America
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and the islands of the sea. It was a phase of this
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>problem that caused the Civil War. This is a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>true statement, but it is a man’s vision. That is to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>say, it sees clearer across seas than across the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>table or the street. Particularly it omits what is
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>happening within the family, “the race” at home;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>a family also capable of civil war.

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In paraphrase of this statement I would say

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>a cause for special celebration. But was it? So
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>much of the mother was obliterated, so much

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Even when they did join, the rewards were
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>not always equitable or just. All too frequently
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Asian-American women labored quietly behind
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>their more vocal and demonstrative white sisters,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and watched them get the better jobs and the

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>color were invited to join the white feminist move

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>hoods. But rarely did white women seek out or

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>their community on their terms.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>All along, Asian-American women did not

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>in the process of obtaining this newly defined lib

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that Asian-American women must, nevertheless,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>understand and articulate as best they can their

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>lest others speak for them.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>What, then, are their major priorities? Asian
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>American women must first of all be assured of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>economic security and legal protection. These
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>must also be secured for family and community
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>since their minority status places racial, com
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>munity, and group needs as primary, even before
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feminist considerations. This is true, no matter
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>how financially well-off an Asian-American wom
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>an may become. She cannot afford to entertain
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the fantasy that she has become totally accepted
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>as American because her face, features, and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>body will mark her as Asian first. She is, by birth,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>a “marginal person” in America. If she has main

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>she will have to deal with deeper issues of cultur

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>wherein she may be required to act more Asian
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>among Asians and more American among non
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Asians. She may have to learn to “talk up” like a
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>white American to lessen the chances of job dis

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Second, no matter to what degree she identi
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>fies with and works alongside white feminists for
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>her personal and collective liberation, she cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lose sight of the fact that she will always be
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>viewed and treated by many white Americans in
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>a compromising way: they may both admire and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>resent her advancing status and role in society.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Will they, for example, acknowledge and share
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>or transfer their power and resources into her
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>capable hands to manage? In this battle zone of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>power politics, she needs to have her security
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and identity firmly built on her ethnic and cul
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tural base, or else she will not be able to survive
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the crossfires of upward mobility. She can never
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>forget that if she loses, she will be thrown right
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>back into her ethnic community, seeking support
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and sustenance.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Third, she needs to examine her priorities
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>carefully and budget her time wisely because her
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>fractured bi-cultural identity and life in America
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>demand it. Is her main concern where to build
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>her career and how to get there? If so, she needs
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>to acquire more culture-appropriate American
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>skills and strategies to increase her chances of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>success. If, however, she is trying to survive with
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>her husband and children, she may decide to de
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>vote more of her energies to community efforts
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>which benefit her family directly. If she is a young
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and single woman, she needs to decide if she is
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>going to be “more Asian” or “more American” in
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>her dating preferences, her social patterns, and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>what her own cultural tradition means to her.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Finally, her bi-cultural background and role
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>in America offers her a greater range of choices
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>from which to adopt values and approaches than
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>a mono-cultural role would permit. She can pro
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>gress in the American culture of mobility and in
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>dependence when it suits her, but can also re
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>treat into her Asian cultural haven of inter
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>dependence and stability when she is tired and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>worn out from struggling to get ahead. She can
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>work for equality through women’s groups and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>join her local ethnic community to combat racism.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>In all her varied choices and roles, she is an

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>On October 15, 1981, one hundred women in Ithaca, New York, brought
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>a “dish to pass” to the Unitarian Church parlor. They came to honor

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>From an open workshop on art and politics, the major metaphor for our

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>We’re fortunate in Ithaca to have a herstory rich in both Abolition and

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>We were not trying to gloss over the suffragist betrayal of black women,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>nor the distrust that exists now between the races. But we hoped that
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the pride in the strong women of our heritages and an experience of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>warmth would provide a context for a future dialogue about the fragile
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>relationship between women of different races.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>I knew l’d learn something tonight. Being a freshman and all, I feel it&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>...It made me remember my great-grandmother, her touch, her color,

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>So we created a potluck dinner, with a program equally balanced be

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a long continuity from grandmother to children to children’s children.

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Can you imagine only five short days ago tonight was just an idea in a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>few people’s minds? Sunday we began planning. On Monday we started
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to talk to women in the community. On Tuesday we invited the guests of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>honor. On Wednesday the singers were approached. This woman came
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>forward to offer a poem, that one to hang an etching from Harriet Tub
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>man’s grave. “Backstage” we who’ve been planning it feel like a miracle
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>somehow happened, and that miracle is your spontaneity and strong
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>networks that made this possible! —Suzanne Lacy
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>One woman sang spirituals, another sang Emily Dickinson’s poems set to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>music. Someone read Susan Griffin’s poem on Harriet Tubman, and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Mrs. Washington read from a book about how her great aunt was the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>first woman to receive a pension from the army. Mrs. Blauvelt told us
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>about the history of women’s suffrage in Ithaca and how her red-haired
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>mother became a feminist after visiting a sweatshop. In the warm inter
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lude after they spoke, the guests settled deeper into their seats, and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>someone asked what came next. It seemed to all as if we had come to a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>beginning rather than an ending...
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>I am amazed by how few people I know in this room, and l’ve been here
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>11 years. I think it would be just fantastic to do this again, if we each
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>brought the people we know. ... To begin a dialogue is very very impor-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tant—to view this as a beginning, not as a once in a lifetime happening.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>That would be very sad. —Carolyn Whitlow
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>One at a time each woman in the room rose to introduce herself to the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>others. After the first few women spoke, it was clear that here, in the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>experiences of each woman, was the real “heart” of the evening. This
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>was the beginning of the dialogue:

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I retired here from New York about 19 years ago. l’m so glad to see that
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>something else is coming up to take the place of my old women’s club
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>For 14 years or so we had a lot of “dish to pass,” but for some reason
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>they were discontinued. I think it’s the nicest thing when women get
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>together and eat together, and I love to see these young people. I can
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>remember when suffrage came up and I worked for it, and I can see that
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women have really come a long way.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>l’m Lillian Johnson and I came here and ate a lot of food! When I heard
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>about the dinner this afternoon I said, “Oh! My CR group is held tonight,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>what am I going to do?” So I ran over there and said, “Come on to this
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>thing!” and here we are!
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>l’m Sally Lee and l’m a cytologist at the community hospital. I’m a di

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>very badly. When I first came here it was very lonely, you know, and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>this woman here next to me took me under her wing. History-wise, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the first black woman to work in the J.J. Newberry’s here, and as a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>woman I was the first to work at Tomkins Hospital cytology lab.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I am Kumiko. Originally I came from Japan, 22 years ago. That makes it
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>exactly half my life in Ithaca. I am an architectural designer; I am an

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I am Kumiko’s daughter, Noni, and I was born in Ithaca.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I was coerced into coming here tonight, but l’m glad I did. My name is
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Deborah Jamison. l’m the administrative assistant loan officer in Ithaco
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Neighborhood Housing Services. We’re the people that run around and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>do all the little fixin’ up in the downtown area. l’m also on the board oj
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the Southside Center and I want to do a little advertising plug for our
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>auction. There will be assorted objects there for people to browse
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>around and look at and better prices. You cannot miss it! Tonight has

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>My name is Joan. l’ve wanted to say something all evening but l’m so
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>shy. l’ve always felt the meals I prepare for my family are works of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>I’m Blanche Thompson and I used to work with Mrs. Washington in the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women’s club. In 1940 we met with a group of women at Southside Com
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>munity Center and we unveiled a monument to Harriet Tubman. I praise
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>God for being able to be in your midst tonight, because one time today l
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>told Mrs. Washington I wouldn’t be able to come. I have arthritis and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>heart condition and I didn’t think l’d be able to drive, but truly the Lord
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>made the way for me to be here tonight. I enjoyed the dinner and I
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>enjoyed being with you tonight, so just pray for me.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I’m Bernice Miller. l’ve been knowing Mrs. Washington a long time, and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she and I talk half the night all the time!
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I’m Pearl Murray, and I cook at one of the fraternity houses at Cornell.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>From there, I cook at home. The door is always open so that anybody
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that would like to, come, and there’s always a cup of tea or something
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>waiting there. Mrs. Washington is a lovely person, a lovely friend, and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>we don’t talk at night...I can never get her on the phone! Everybody
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>else is talking to her! Anyway, I catch her on the weekends. Many many
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>more happy nights like this, and food—I love to cook!
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>My name is Joan Alber. l’m a member of the Bernadette Powell defense

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>where I work, and I would love to do it for a function like this!
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I feel really tongue-tied around all you fascinating people. l’m a part-

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>great night and l’d like to see it continue. There’s so many important
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>issues we could work on, something for everybody and even still there’s
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>work to go around.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The morning after the dinner, a small planning group met to brainstorm
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ideas for the future. Nancy had always wanted to stage tours of under
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ground railroad stations with dramatic enactments along the way. Mar
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ilyn suggested a city-wide patchwork quilt, each square a portrait of a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>woman important to a woman resident. The tree painting could be signed
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>again and again, becoming a symbol of evolving networks. Another din
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ner might honor all the ethnicities in Ithaca—big enough to fill the foot
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ball stadium!
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We met that morning because we knew that our single dinner, no matter
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>how successful as a first experience, would not substantially address
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>racism and sectarianism among the women of Ithaca (as one black wom
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>an said before the dinner, “It’s the second meeting where the shit starts
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to come down!”). Nor would it create a particularly deep experience of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women’s community where there was as yet little recognition of it. It
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>seemed to usthatthe process we had set in motion needed to be nurtured
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with subsequent events. I left a tired but enthusiastic planning group
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and returned to Los Angeles. They continued meeting two or three times,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and then stopped.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>When I went to Ithaca I set up a question for myself: How long was it
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>necessary to be in a place in order to produce a networking perform
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ance, and how long could the process set in motion by the artwork be
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sustained afterward? I wondered if it would be possible to adopt the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>model of the suffragist “stumper” who traveled from town to town rais
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing the vote—a person-to-person consciousness-raising and community
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>building process, a kind of interaction subsumed in our culture by mass
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>media. Could we create a network among women across the country
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>through performances? In Ithaca I learned that in the right community,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>with the support of activists there, a very moving event could be pro
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>duced in a week. But the lack of time to build a follow-up group and the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>unfamiliarity of the goals and processes of such performance events,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>together with the press of people’s normal lives, seemed to contribute to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>our inability to sustain energy after the performance.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>This issue is related to another problem with such performances: as rich
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>an experience as one evening might be, the real problems of racism, the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>daily perpetuation of oppression and its institutionalization, are stagger
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ing in their enormity. How can we even presume to touch upon them
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>with a single evening, particularly one clothed in good feelings rather
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>than with real underlying hurt and anger? The contradiction with broad
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>based networking is that the purpose (at least the apparent and stated
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>purpose) must be unthreatening and wide enough in its appeal to attract
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>many different kinds of women—sometimes appearing hopelessly “lib
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>eral” when measured by a radical yardstick—yet were we to pose more
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>difficult political issues at these beginning stages we might run the risk
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of attracting only the converted.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>It is important to remember when assessing such artworks that though
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>they may approach the problems of real life, the things they offer are not
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>always the same as political strategies. Artists cannot take the place of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>activists; exactly what they can offer to political movements, aside from
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>“illustrating” the cause, is not always clear. They may be able to offer
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>us models and strategies; only careful analysis and questioning will
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>show that. The Tree dinner was developed on the premise that over
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>coming oppression on an individual level begins with dialogue, and that
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a dialogue is facilitated by experiences of pleasure in being with one
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>another—building, if ever so slowly, situations of trust. This may or may
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>not be an effective long-term strategy for dealing with racism; in the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>short term, for that night, the experience of love among the women in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that room was undeniable. l’m really not sure how much art can do
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>toward social change. One thing l’m sure it can do, however, is to offer
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>us a vision of the possible; it can realize, over and over, metaphors for
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>community that create for us, if only temporarily, the experience of the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>relationships we one day hope to have with each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Suzanne Lacy is a feminist performance artist from Los Angeles. She explained,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>during the performance at Cornell: “T’m an artist but I don’t paint; I do perfor-
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>mance art, which is essentially theater that takes place in real life with each of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>us as an actor playing herself.

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>from all of you.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I want you to stop talking in abstractions and

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and consciously and publicly affirm the need for

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>can affect the community immediately.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The first thing I want people to examine is how

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>This essay has an interesting herstory. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>read aloud at the first meeting of the Fayetteville
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>women’s racism workshop in March 1980. From
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>what I understand, the statement was very well
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>received. Sexuality was selected as a key issue to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>focus on in future meetings.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Numerous white women thanked me in the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>following weeks for sending the statement. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>typed by someone in the workshop on a good
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>typewriter and I got the original. A group on the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>way to the west coast asked my permission to re-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>print the article.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>All of which is very gratifying, except that the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>racism workshop fizzled out. Fewer and fewer
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>people showed up for the meetings, until the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>workshop ended, only weeks after it began.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>As far as I know, no white woman took re-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sponsibility for individual acts of racism toward
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>any women or children of color. However, a

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>issue of race except me.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The essay sat in my writing box for two years
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>before I resurrected it. I submitted a copy to a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>woman of color who was editing an anthology on
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>dialogue between lesbians of color and white les
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bians.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>She loved it. Her lover loved it. She wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>use it to open an anti-racism workshop.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>This raised an important question in my mind:
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Why did this essay sit in my box for two years?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Did I let the silent message of the racism work
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>shop convince me that my work wasn’t valid, no
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>matter what people verbally said? Because they
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>obviously weren’t going to deal with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>The realization is overpowering to me that
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that’s what words like support&quot; and “valida
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tion mean—the difference between important

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>It is not that women of color do not write. We
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>don’t get recognition for it. We don’t get identi
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>fied as “important feminist writers” the way
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>white women do, either.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>It takes a lot of time and money to pursue pub
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>lication, even in women s&apos;presses. I saw a notice
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>in a women writers’ newsletter recently that said

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>doing that? You can bet your ass Gloria Steinem
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and the ladies at Ms. magazine will still see their
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>names in print. Besides, often the cost of return
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>postage is greater than the cost of xeroxing an
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>article. And who the hell wants to pay to receive
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>their own rejection slip?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>These may seem like small details, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>doesn’t take too many of them to pile up before
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>people like me are excluded. Again.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>The message the racism workshop transmitted
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>to me was: “Okay, spic, we can’t just ignore you
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>this time and you may have some valid gripes but

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>On April 4, 1979, the four of us met to discuss
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>consciousness-raising guidelines for women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>groups working on the issue of racism. All of us
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>had had experiences, as white and Black women,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>thinking and talking about racism with white

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>based on it.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>We feel that using consciousness-raising to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>explore our racism is particularly useful and ap

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sential for getting at how each of us is racist in a

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>action possible. The women’s movement has be
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>gun to address racism in a way that no previous
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>movement has, because we have a growing un

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in how we interact with other women. Doing CR
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>acknowledges that how we feel can inhibit or
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>lead to action, and that how we actually treat
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>people does make a difference.

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>what is happening. CR about racism is not merely

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>well as what can be done to work against it. This
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>work originated from our search for ways to

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>whites need to raise consciousness about racism
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>among other white people. In every class we

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ever our specific topic. But we think it is crucial
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>to focus specifically on the ways in which institu
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tional racism victimizes all people, and especially
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>how it functions systematically to oppress people
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of color.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In order to accomplish these goals, we first
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>provide information about institutional racism
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that clarifies the relationship between personally

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and the structural and political means by which
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>racism is maintained in our society. When we
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>first began teaching about this issue, our focus
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was almost entirely on this structural level, and
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>some students responded with defensiveness,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>helplessness, and even anger and blame toward
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>one another. We were dissatisfied with these re
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sults because we felt they did little to change stu
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>dents’ understanding of racism or enable them to
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>act more effectively against it.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>A more productive approach, we felt, would
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>be one that facilitated nonjudgmental and non
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>defensive ways for participants to explore the

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>for both participants and workshop leaders.

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>1. We make the assumption that each person
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>is attending the workshop because she wants to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>work against racism and has a sincere desire to

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>2. We state that the purpose of the workshor
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>is not to attack or blame each other. We are not

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>We begin teaching about racism by defining
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>what we mean when we use the term. While this
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>may seem elementary, our experience has con
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>firmed that students have many definitions in

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>students in the discussion of the issue, we ask
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>class members what the word “racism” means to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>them. Typically, the answers include examples of

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>feel, and when they say, “I feel bad, or I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>guilty, we talk about guilt: What is it? Where

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>their experience. This exercise has been usefu
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in helping white women become aware of white
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>racism on an intense, emotional level. Many
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>women have found it to be a profound experience
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>enabling them to understand the meaning of the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>more subtle forms of racism in a way that dis

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>varied, including sadness and anger, although
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>occasionally there will be little reaction. It is im
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>portant to remind participants to listen to each
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>other in a nonjudgmental manner. If judgments

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Unable to deal with these feelings, white people
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>often become detached, denying the existence of

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>is to help white people to discharge their racist
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>stereotypes and feelings, people of color should
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>not work with whites. Third World people do not

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>which takes about 20 minutes, these groups can

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>In another discharge exercise, students spend
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>10 minutes talking in dyads about their earlies

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>It is important for students to describe specific

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in turn treats her partner as her parent, saying
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the thoughts and feelings she has about the inci

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>racist incident. She then recalls a racist situation
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>which she did not interrupt, what stopped her
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and what she could do differently were she in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that situation again. The purpose of this exercise
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>is to sensitize students to the fact that nearly

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>the examples just discussed, or we give study

			<pb n='73'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>have encountered a number of problems. Like all
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>whites, we experience our own resistance to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>working on racism, which results partly from the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>fact that we had no models for dealing with the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>complexities of teaching/learning about racism
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>from our own educational experience, and our
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>colleagues in the university provide few exam
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ples. We also find it painful to acknowledge and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>point out the racism that exists among feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>because we spend a great deal of time with stu
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>dents, analyzing our experiences as women, the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>interrelatedness of racism and sexism, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>hope feminism offers for change. To say now that
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feminists, too, are racist is bitter medicine, in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>deed. On a personal level, we experience our
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>own white guilt and, as we examine racism, we
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>have to be willing to see ourselves in everything
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>we say. Because racism is such a difficult issue,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>we know that a confrontation could develop
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>among students or between ourselves and stu

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>But such frightening possibilities demonstrate
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the necessity of doing this work. Pushing these

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>occur results in “over-control” of the class and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>prevents any real learning. It is more helpful to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>admit that we are scared and to discuss with stu
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>dents our difficulties. There are real reasons for
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>these reactions, and it is important not to blame
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ourselves for them. As a result, we do not have to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>put energy into keeping up a front and can work
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>more effectively. We hope that by sharing our
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>feelings with them students will feel free to ex
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>plore the issue and be less fearful that they may
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>appear racist or that they need to demonstrate
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>how free of racism they are. We ask students for
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>support for ourselves and for one another, and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>we ask for feedback that will help us evaluate the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>work we are doing together on this issue. Stu
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>dents are most often very helpful in teaching us
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and each other about racism and in assisting us
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>in improving the methods we use. Racism is a dif

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>It is imperative that white people work
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>against racism at a personal/emotional level as

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>called art can have a political impact, and that in the making of art and of
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>all cultural artifacts our identities as women play a distinct role. We hope
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>theory, as well as generate new creative energies among women. It will be
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to broaden
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ing the definition and function of art
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>HERESIES is published by a collective of feminists, some of whom are
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists; our fields include
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>history, architecture, filmmaking, photography, and video. While the
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>themes of the individual issues will be determined by the collective, each
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>issue will have a different editorial staff, composed of women who want to
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>work on that issue as well as members of the collective. HERESIES provides
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>experience for women who work editorially, in design and in production.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>An open evaluation meeting will be held after the appearance of each
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>issue. HERESIES will try to be accountable to and in touch with the inter
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>national feminist community.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lives, our arts, and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connec
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tions are clarified, they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>between artist and audience, and to understand the relationship between
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art within the present
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because they are
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>nor to the competitive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_10_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art.
