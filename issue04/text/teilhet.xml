            <p>Examine the claim: nonliterate art is
               a system of communication which man-
               ifests the ideologies and beliefs that
               bring order and definition to a person’s
               culture. This statement seems fine, but
               who makes these art forms and whose
               view does the culture indeed reflect?
               have come to realize that the arts, the
               hieratic arts in particular, reflect male
               behavior and opinion, for it is men who
               dominate the “important” arts. Wom-
               en artists (and their art forms) play a
               more equivocal cultural role because
               they cannot work in certain materials
               or use specialized tools or technology
               and, in many cultures, cannot make
               figurative images.1 But we shall neither
               analyze nor interpret the role of the
               woman artist in nonliterate cultures un-
               til we have examined the role of the
               male artist.</p>
               <p>Most of the documentation of nonlit-
               erate art assumes that only a man can
               be an artist. This man, depending on
               the cultural area, must possess talent,
               skill, intelligence and, on occasion.
               genealogical rights of privilege. Polyne-
               sia has a distinct class of professional
               artists to which one can belong only if
               one is born male and has the appropri-
               ate lineage and natural talent.? In Mel-
               anesia talent and competitive skill rath-
               er than genealogy are the requisites for
               the coveted position of artist, but it is
               still only the male who qualifies.? The
               men often serve an apprenticeship since
               the ritual meaning and knowledge of
               the objects they make are as important
               as learning the essential skills and exer-
               cising the necessary talent. In contrast
               to Oceanic cultures, in the Arctic it is
               generally believed that all male adults
               are able to make art. As Edmund Car-
               penter comments: “carving is a normal,
               essential skill (for the Eskimo), just as
               writing is with us.”4 In Africa the posi-
               tion and training of the male artist
               ranges between the extremes of Poly
               nesia and the Arctic.</p>
               <p>Though the social status of the male
               artist varies in these societies, as do
               their artistic skill and training, the
               women have uniformly limited access
               to the art arena. Even in societies such
               as that of Polynesia, where they have
               political and economic importance,
               women work in “barkcloth and weav
               ing, but the important hard-media
               crafts Jare the preserve of men."5 In
               Melanesia, where the political and ec-
               onomic power lie mainly in the hands of
               the “Big Men, women work in pottery
               and weaving. In many African cul-
               tures, the Yoruba of Nigeria for exam
               ple, women can achieve political and/
               or economic importance and are not en
               tirely excluded from ritual, yet
               women do the spinning, dyeing, mat-
               ting, and the potting; and the remaind
               er of the crafts are practiced by men."6</p>
               <p>Douglas Fraser points out that
               primitive man, though he may not
               have a word for art
               almost always
               differentiates between objects produced
               by a slow, repetitive
               process, such as
               weaving or pottery (craf
               and other
               objects of paramount significance for
               his culture. He relegates craft work to
               inferiors (i.e., women); only men, as a
               rule, practiced carving and painting.
               Fraser’s observation is accurate, but
               Andrew Whiteford, in response to
               Fraser, raises the question of whether
               the crafts made by women can be con-
               sidered, from a Western perspective,
               any less an art form than the art
               made by men. In reference to American
               Indian cultures, Whiteford writes:
               That one type of painting is realistic,
               religious, and male-produced, while the
               other is geometric, secular—although it
               may have religious connotations we do
               not know about—and female-produced
               does not suffice to put them in different
               categories. If we insist upon separating
               them, we are led to the disparaging
               conclusion that Indian men created
               sacred art: women only manufactured
               mundane crafts.8</p>
               <p>Our aesthetic and cognitive response
               to these art forms made by women is of-
               ten different from the response in the
               cultures that produced them. We may
               indeed designate many of the objects
               made by women as art.” But we must
               realize that we differentiate between
               art and craft” in terms of ideas of
               innovation,"“creativity” and “signif-
               icant form; by strict Western defini-
               tion most nonliterate arts would then
               fall into the category of craft. This dis-
               tinction between art and craft by West-
               ern standards is thus an arbitrary one
               when applied out of context to nonliter-
               ate art: women artists are neither more
               nor less innovative and creative within
               the media they use than are men artists.</p>
               <quote>The specific difference between the art-
               ist and non-artist seems to be one of de-
               gree. This is more obvious in a non-lit-
               erate, or so-called primitive society,
               than in our own. In pre-European Ha-
               waii, for example, nearly all women
               made bark cloth called kapa (tapa),
               decorating it with highly creative de-
               signs. In a broad sense most of these
               women were artists, some better than
               others, for some examples of tapa dis-
               play more intuitive inventiveness and
               mastery of technique than others."9</quote>
               <p>Many nonliterate cultures distin-
               guish between what might be called
               secular, utilitarian objects and religio-
               political, status objects. The latter are
               classified either by their use or their

              <p>ritual process of manufacture, or in
               some cases, by a finer quality of work--
               manship. For example, in the Mar-
               quesas, a serving bowl not made by a
               male artist with deep knowledge of
               magic and ritual would be just a bowl
               because it had not been properly initi-
               ated into the Universe.1° Both men and
               women produce secular objects, but in
               most cultures it is the expert male artist
               who usually works on the culturally de
               termined, more important art ob-
               jects. (We must remember that it was
               the Western world—mainly via male
               anthropologists and art historians-
               that introduced the concept of “art to
               nonliterate cultures, and determined
               what would qualify as art, with until
               recently, little corroboration from the
               indigenous people themselves.) The
               issue here, however, is not whether we
               accept the objects produced by women
               as art, but why most women were
               and are traditionally denied access to
               the specialized role of artist as creator
               of religio-political objects. The relevant
               factor is that however art is defined, all
               nonliterate cultures distinguish be-
               tween the art produced by men and
               that produced by women; and this is
               our concern here.</p>
               <p>The disparities of style, technique
               and media between men and women
               artists appear to be universal. In most
               cultures women are rarely allowed to
               make anthropomorphic or zoomorphic
               forms; these are the prerogative of men.
               In most cultures women are rarely per-
               mitted to make objects requiring the
               knowledge of ritual process or the skill
               and knowledge of manipulating certain
               specialized tools. And there seems to be
               a universal taboo against women's            
               sculpting in hard materials such
               wood, bone, ivory, stone, gold and
               metal compounds; these materials are
               used exclusively by men.1 Women can
               work only with soft, malleable materi-
               als: clay, gourds, basketry, leather or
               weaving. We can therefore say that a
               distinction exists (in traditional nonlit-
               erate societies) between the arts made
               by men and women.</p>
               <p>Franz Boas has commented that the
               stylistic differences he observed in an
               Eskimo community arose both from
               differences in the technical processes
               and (even more) from the fact that men
               do the realistic work and women the
               clothing and sewn leather work.12 Wil-
               liam Bascom pursues Boas’s notion
               that a sexual division of labor must also
               be considered in regard to stylistic dif-
               ferences:</p>
               <quote>In painting, for example, there are
               marked contrasts between the represen-
               tational designs of men and the geomet-
               ric patterns of women among the
               American Indians of the Plains and the
               Great Basin; and the same is true in
               bead-working. Among the Ashanti and
               the peoples of the Cameroun grass-
               lands, the anthropomorphic pottery
               pipes made by men contrast sharply
               with the pottery produced by women.13</quote>
               <p>He has also noted that artists divided
               within a society by sex and/or craft
               may develop distinct styles, just as iso-
               lated subtribes do. Both Boas and
               Bascom address the broad issue of dis-
               tinct styles within one society, and each
               notes that when the men and the wom-
               en work in the same medium their
               products are markedly distinguishable.
               Robert Rattray, working among the
               Ashanti of Ghana, also notes this dis-
               tinction: “Men do not fashion pots or
               pipes unless they represent anthropo-
               morphic or zoomorphic forms, for
               women are forbidden to make these.15</p>
               <p>Such a distinction is also observed
               among American Indians: Whiteford
               found that women’s art, excluding
               tourist art, rarely portrayed animal and
               human forms.16 The media shared by
               men and women are also distinguished
               by technique or process. For example,
               Yoruba men and women both weave.
               The men use a horizontal, narrow band
               loom. The women, however, use a ver-
               tical cotton loom. Men may have
               adopted the horizontal loom because it
               can produce an endless strip of cloth,
               thereby relegating the more restrictive
               or “inferior process of the vertica
               loom for the women.18 Roslyn Walker,
               however, suggests that the women s'use
               of the vertical loom is a practical
               distinction, since the vertical loom is
               not placed against the abdomen and al-           
               lows a woman to continue weaving dur-
               ing pregnancy.”19 Her argument is not
               compelling since women are only preg-
               nant for a few years of their working
               life.</p>
               <p>Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic
               forms are usually reserved for the more
               important or sacred religio-political
               representations of deities, ancestors
               and benevolent and malèvolent spirits
               or divine personages. One might con-
               clude that women are restricted from
               making these forms because of their
               powerful association with the superna-
               tural. But, among the Anang of Nigeria
               and other societies, human and animal
               figurines are used as house decorations
               and toys.2° Since these figures are pure-
               ly secular, we might question why
               women are not allowed to make them.
               Women cannot make them because
               they are carved in wood; they would
               probably be allowed to make a rudi-
               mentary toy figure in clay. But as wom-
               en do not generally make these images
               they would not necessarily be able to
               make even a clay figure, so it is not
               surprising to discover that women do
               not try. In the final analysis, one must
               conclude that anthropomorphic and
               zoomorphic forms are of such para-
               mount importance that making them is
               a privilege given almost exclusively to
               men.21 There are exceptions to this re-
               striction: certamn women have extra-
               ordinary talents and skills not unlike a
               shaman, for which particular societies
               make allowances. 1 will return to this
               point later.</p>
               <p>Certain oral traditions relate how
               women once made anthropomorphic
               images. One such story is reported by
               Rattray. The Ashanti people told him
               about a potter, Denta, who became
               barren because she modeled “figure
               pots. Thereafter, according to the
               Ashanti, women did not make highly
               ornamented pottery.22 Rattray was also
               told that women were forbidden to
               make anthropomorphic forms because
               they required greater skill.23 (In con-
               nection with the grave punishment of
               becoming barren, Ashanti women are
               forewarned that they do not have the
               greater skill, which implies the skill of
               ritual knowledge.) Little literature is
               available relating specifically to the
               prohibition against women s making
               anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms,
               but of the accounts that 1 know, women
               who initiated the making of such im-
               ages were either killed, sworn to secrecy
               or made barren.2 That some women
               initially created figurines may relate to
               their innate role as natural creator of
               anthropomorphic forms. Adrian Ger-

               that the woodcarver, the maker of
               wooden images, has a special place in
               the Asmat society. Just as a new human
               being develops in the body of a woman,
               so does wood come to life in his hand.
               His creativity, however, belongs to
               another sphere. From the woman
               comes the life of this world, whereas he
               creates supernatural life.”25 One might
               also argue that women, as creators of
               human beings, had no subliminal need
               to create anthropomorphic representa-
               tions. But if that were the case, men
               would not have thought it necessary to
               restrict the women’s imagery.2 One
               could surmise that women, with their
               innate powers to give birth in the real
               world, were already too powerful and
               to balance that power men took as their
               prerogative the right to create super
               natural life in the forms of anthropo-
               morphic and zoomorphic images.</p>
               <p>Some women, mentioned above, are
               allowed to make anthropomorphic and
               zoomorphic forms in soft materials
               such as clay. A survey showing the cul-
               tural distribution of these women has
               not been compiled. Women in Melane-
               sia (i.e., Wusi, New Hebrides, and the
               Chambri lakes district of New Guinea
               and Africa make figurative images in
               terra cotta. Robert Thompson, in his
               article “Abatan: A Master Potter of the
               Egbado Yoruba, gives us an excellent
               portrait of a woman artist. Both Aba-
               tan’s mother and maternal grandmoth-
               er were potters. Unlike male artists, she
               had no formal training. She learned her
               technique and inspiration from the con-
               stant observation of her mother.
               Abatan is known for her figurative
               vessels (awo ota eyinle), a vessel for the
               stones of Eyinle, a Yoruba god with
               an amazing synthesis of powers of the
               hunt, herbalism, and water.</p>
               <p>Abatan’s parents believed that she
               came into the world through the grace
               of Eyinle. Accordingly, as an invoca-
               tion, she received the name of the deity
               before his transformation, Abatan...
               As the senior member of the cult of
               Oshun and Eyinle at Oke-Odan,
               Abatan lives a life of prestige, balanced
               just short of hauteur. . .."28 Thomp-               
               son stresses the fact that Abatan is a
               women artist of stature among the Eg-
               bado Yoruba. She is not an ordinary
               woman, she has religio-political and ec-
               onomic status. But had she not been
               born the daughter of a potter and not
               come into the world through the grace
               of Eyinle and not been talented, she
               would not have had the opportunity to
               make figurative pots and accrue status.
               This safeguards the making of figura-
               tive images from incursion by just any
               woman.</p>
               <p>Among the Plain Longuda of Niger-
               ia, certain women are allowed to make
               anthropomorphic and zoomorphic pots
               for the Kwandlha cult.29 The master of
               Kwandlha must be an artist as well as a
               healer, for the spirits of diseases will
               not take up their abode in poorly ex-
               ecuted Kwandlha vessels. Dasumi, of
               the village of Guyuk, is respected for
               her knowledge and skill in making the
               Kwandlha pots. She is woman past
               child-bearing years, and unlike
               Abatan, she did not inherit her posi-
               tion. In the early 1960s Dasumi was
               plagued with a series of illnesses; she
               went to Moudo, an elderly woman liv
               ing nearby, to be cured. Moudo told
               Dasumi that the Kwandlha were wor-
               rying her, they were calling her to be
               come a member of the cult. Dasumi ap-
               prenticed with Moudo for about two
               years before she became a master of the
               Kwandlha.</p>
               <p>Dasumi specializes in children’s dis-
               eases; when a child is sick, the mother
               will consult Dasumi. She examines the
               child and then takes one of her diagnos-
               tic Kwandlha pots from their own spe-
               cial hut (tanda Kwandlha). If the par-
               ticular Kwandlha stays submerged in a
               basin of water, then her diagnosis is
               correct; if not, she will take another
               Kwandlha and repeat this process until
               one stays submerged. The child is given
               some medicine and the mother gives
               Dasumi some of the special red clay re-
               quired to fashion a Kwandlha. Dasumi
               will touch the child’s body with the red
               clay, beseeching the spirit of the disease
               to leave the child and acknowledge that
               she will be making an abode for it. In
               seclusion Dasumi will create, with the
               coil and mold method, a Kwandlha pot
               that personifies that disease. Gurgu-
               burile, for example, is a pot given a
               human form: the feet are the base of the
               pot, the legs, arms and belly make up
               the body of the pot, the neck is the neck
               and the open mouth of the head is the
               mouth of the pot. Gurguburile is
               covered with festering sores, one arm is
               eaten away and the other holds a cala-
               bash for water. This anthropomorphic
               pot is used to cure leprosy.</p>
               <p>Upon completing a pot, Dasumi
               gives it to the mother to sun dry for four
               days before firing. Once fired, Dasumi
               returns to begin the ritualized process
               of calling the spirit of the disease to
               leave the child and enter the Kwandl-
               ha; this entails a special Kwandlha
               language, the sacrifice of a chicken or
               goat and a special drink called Sinke
               contained in a special terra-cotta urn,
               Suthala. Dasumi is paid in kind or coin
               for her work.</p>
               <p>Though Dasumi works within an
               iconographic tradition, she is allowed
               to introduce new elements as long as it
               pleases the spirits. She was, when 1
               interviewed her in 1968, more famous
               than Moudo, her teacher. My infor-
               mant, Elam Robaino, attributed this to
               her artistic skills as a maker of Kwandl-
               ha pots. The spirits of the diseases are
               pleased with her pots; they like their
               abodes.</p>
               <p>I asked Dasumi if men made
               Kwandlha pots; she replied that a man
               in Purokayo village, some four miles
               from Guyak, makes small ones for chil-
               dren. There is also an old man in Kuryi
               village who makes Kwandlha from
               wood, but it takes him much time to do
               it. She added that her grandson, who
               was three, seemed to have a calling for
               the Kwandlha; her daughters were not
               called to the profession. 30</p>
               <p>Both Dasumi and Abatan were
               called to their particular cults and both
               proved to have the necessary artistic
               skills to make figurative vessels; one
               inherited the profession, the other ap-
               prenticed. Of equal importance is the
               fact that their own society made allow-
               ances for women of unusual talent to
               enter the male domain of the figurative
               arts.</p>
               <p>Lacking sufficient data from other
               societies, one can only conjecture that
               the tradition of making figurative im-
               agery is open, in certain societies, only
               to exceptional women—women who
               cross the boundary between the sacred
               and profane.</p>
               <p>More universal in its application is
               the taboo against women s working
               with hard materials and certain special-
               ized tools. Although terra-cotta in
               comparison with wood is a relatively
               permanent medium, the women work</p>
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_102.jpg" n="102" xml:id="img_0102"/>
            <p>
               this medium when it is soft and malle
               able. That it is transformed when fired
               into a relatively hard and durable sub
               stance does not appear to be an issue.</p>
               <p>The hard materials used as a primary
               medium by male artists are usually rat-
               ed in most nonliterate cultures accord-
               ing to their relative importance. The
               scale of relative importance, power or
               sanctity of the medium varies from cul-
               ture to culture, but the culturally de-
               fined criterion is generally determined
               by the material’s durability, scarcity,
               the skill and/or technology necessary to
               work it and the medium s'innate magi-
               co-religious properties. As a general
               rule, the more important materials are
               reserved for the more important deities
               or supernatural forces. Among the Yor-
               uba, wood is rarely employed to repre-
               sent the gods because of its perishable
               nature. Wood is used, however, for vo-
               tive sculpture representing priests or
               devotees.32 To the Asmat, who live in
               an alluvial mudflat that lacks stone or
               metal ores, wood becomes the impor-
               tant medium. Wood is so important in
               this culture that man and tree are re-
               garded as interchangeable concepts:
               the human being is a tree and the tree is
               a human being.33 That wood is a mor-
               tal” living substance can enhance its
               value as a symbolic referent, as intimat
               ed by the Asmat man/tree equivalent.
               In cultures that have a variety of
               materials to choose from, one also
               finds, as with the Yoruba, that the mor-
               tal-decaying aspect of wood relegates
               its use to the more human realms asso-
               ciated with ancestor spirits, culture he-
               roes and demigods, as well as priests
               and devotees. Because of its accessibil
               ity and the varying skills of adeptness
               cessary to carve it, wood is a populai
               medium in nonliterate cultures.</p>
               <p>Stone is valued for its durability, its
               magical origin and the skill necessary to
               carve it. Many nonliterate cultures
               have access to stone, but few utilize its
               potential (as sculpture in the round in
               contrast to petroglyphs)—possibly be
               cause they lack the tools and necessary
               knowledge to carve it. Polynesians
               knew how to work stone (volcanic tuff),
               but none achieved the monumental
               scale of the Moai on Easter Island.
               African artists worked in stone, but few
               if any today carry on the tradition of
               their forefathers.</p>
               <p>Where stone is worked extensively,
               the stone (like wood) is graded in im
               portance. To the Canadian Eskimos.
               for example, hardness is more impor-
               tant than color or shininess; only the
               weaker and less competent Eskimos
               carve soft stone which is “jokingly re
               ferred to as ’women’s stone.</p>
               <p>The hard, white ivory of the walrus
               tusk is still the Eskimos’ favorite mater-
               ial.35 “The desire to use ivory as an ad-
               junct to stone carving is powerful in
               nearly all areas, whatever the nature of
               the local stone."36 As Nelson Graburn
               explains, the ivory is desired for its
               maleness. The forward thrust of the na-
               tural form is associated with male as-
               sertion.”7 It should be noted that with
               the introduction of the tourist market,
               women have been encouraged to carve.
               But the women only carve occasionally
               and “they do not seem to have im-
               pressed their values on the activity.”38</p>
               <p>Whale ivory was also valued in Poly-
               nesia; in Hawaii the whale ivory (lei
               niho pałaoa) necklace was tapu to all
               except the chief (alii). In Melanesia
               pigs tusks are highly valued as are ele-
               phants tusks in Africa. In former
               times, elephant ivory could only be pos-
               sessed and used by the divine chief
               (Oba) of Benin, Nigeria. In addition to
               the given, man-defining metaphor of
               that particular ivory-bearing animal or
               mammal, the form, color and density of
               the ivory enhances its symbolic refer
               ence to the male genitalia. Ivory
               carved or in its natural state, always
               signals important religio-political con
               cepts. Bone, human or otherwise, is al-
               so an intrinsic carrier of religio-political
               concepts.</p>
               <p>Metals, because of their permanence
               and technical manufacture, are an es-
               teemed material. Though the cultures
               of Oceania did not manufacture metals,
               they were quick to trade with Euro-
               peans for this desirous material.
               Among the Gola of Liberia,“the skill of
               working with metals was considered
               one of the most mysterious and remark-
               able forms of knowledge in the tradi-
               tional culture.”32 The traditional
               bronze or brass casters and the black-
               smiths of Africa are often distinguished
               in that the former are creators of “art
               objects and the latter creators of secular
               objects, such as tools and weapons.
               Both can, however, create art forms;
               both belong to a separate caste, guild or
               disjunctive social group signaling that
               both have mysterious powers” in con-
               nection with the process of manufactur-
               ing metals. That the working of metals
               is a male prerogative also refers to the
               use of metal objects in war and hunt-
               ing. Precious metals such as gold and
               silver reflect the splendor and panoply
               of the conjoined realms of man and
               god.</p>

               <p>The above is not an exhaustive sur-
               vey of hard materials, but it gives a
               summary view of the values and ideol-
               ogies men have attributed to certain
               materials. In short, it seems that men
               have come to identify their maleness
               with materials they have explicitly or
               implicitly chosen as their exclusive pre-
               rogative. Women work in soft materials
               that “best reflect their femaleness. In
               comparison with hard materials, these
               are generally less enduring, fragile,
               more pliable, secondary or subservient,
               common and secularly oriented to
               women s work: i.e., the home, garden.
               cooking and childraising. Originally
               there may have been little or no status
               differentiation between the media; that
               is, the men’s materials were not neces-
               sarily better than the women’s mater-
               ials, until a conscious effort was made
               to give certain materials qualities of
               status and importance. It is plausible
               that women initially had less leisure
               time than men did and therefore turned
               their creative talents toward the mater-
               ials close at hand to make the objects
               necessary for domestic life, without
               identifying with the material. But as
               sex roles became more defined, the art-
               making habits developed into political
               moves, and the material that the men
               initially worked in was given an imag-
               inary power to justify male seizure of
               power and status over women. I believe
               the values and ideologies attributed to
               certain materials were a male invention
               to keep women in their place because 1
               find it curious that women did not
               choose to explore the use of different
               media once the society became more
               settled. Evidence in fact indicates that
               women must have tried to work in other
               materials, otherwise there would not be
               so many tapus against women achiev-
               ing this goal.46</p>

               to work hard materials. In many non-
               literate cultures the artist’s tools are
               somewhat animistic; they are thought
               to possess intelligence, given their own
               family names, and in some areas, such
               as Polynesia, their own genealogy.
               Tools can accrue prestige, power and
               sanctity, for it is the conscious, con-
               joined effort of tools and men that
               create carvings. Carving is a religious
               act; among the Ashanti and other Afri-
               can societies, sacrifices and prayers
               were made to the tools to ask them for
               their assistance and freedom from acci-
               dents.“ In Hawaii the artist “conse
               crated his tools by a sacrifice and a
               chant to insure that sufficient mana
               was contained in them, consequently
               insuring the efficacy of the image, ’the
               house of the god.””42 By ritualizing the
               artist’s tools, women were barred from
               using them because, as sources of pollu
               tion, women would nullify the tools’ ef-
               ficacy. Women were also handicapped
               in that they could not work in the harc
               materials necessary to make their own
               tools. By restricting women from using
               specialized artistry, tools or technology,
               men have safeguarded hard materials
               for their own use. Many scholars have
               commented on the fact that “the act of
               carving should exhibit those qualities
               central to the male hunting and sex
               role.”43 Tools and technology in the
               hands of women would cause an imbal-
               ance in the equipose of sexual labor.</p>
               <p>In addition, a certain cosmology of-
               ten clearly ordains the privilege of carv-
               ing to men. In the Anang society we are
               told that women do not carve because
               the Creator God, Abassi, “wills it and
               has instructed the fate spirit not to as-
               sign the craft to a female.”4 In New
               Ireland there is a legend that the first
               woodcarver learned his craft from a
               ghost. The woodcarver instructed stu
               dents who then became famous artists
               Women were not only excluded from
               art and ritual, they could not even see
               the objects or use the sacred word for
               them, alik or uli, on threat of being
               choked to death by men.45</p>
               <p>For the “important arts” men have
               developed an elaborate process of man-
               ufacture regulated by a prescribed set
               of rituals. The special, prescribed ac-
               tions, repeated over and over again,
               lend continuity and stability to the rit-
               ual. These formal actions, sanctioned
               by religion, are thought to have an eso-
               teric importance which is only fully
               comprehensible to the initiated male
               artists. Rituals have many levels of sig
               nificance, but it is possible that the
               ritualization of the art process devel-
               oped, in part, as a further precaution to
               prevent women from entering this do-
               main. Women have rituals of their own
               and in some cases are allowed to join
               the men’s rituals, but women do not
               have a prescribed set of ritualized ac-
               tions in the creation of their arts. Even
               though Abatan and Dasumi worked in
               the realm of the supernatural, made
               figurative images, and, in the case of
               Dasumi, used a special red clay, thein
               artistic processes were not ritualized
               This signifies that women’s artistry
               deals with the more profane real time
               and space.</p>
               <p>The ritualized making process has
               many variants among nonliterate cul-
               tures, but the majority, if not all, share
               the belief that women are sources of
               pollution. Strict precautions must
               therefore be taken to exclude women
               from these ritualized activities. In Poly-
               nesia tapus of unsacredness “were as-
               sociated for the most part with women,
               to whom dangerous spirits were likel
               to attach themselves, and who were at
               times in a contaminated state psychi-
               cally; and with sickness and death
               which were the signs of the presence of
               fearful demons.46 This equation is               
               present (in varying degrees) in other
               nonliterate cultures, and an important
               aspect of the ritualized artistic process
               is to purify and protect the male artist
               from malevolent forces, which include
               women. In all nonliterate cultures the
               most dangerous form of pollution is
               connected with menstrual blood. Men-
               strual blood was regarded among the
               Maoris of New Zealand as a human be-
               ing manqué.“ The Mbum and Jukun
               of Nigeria segregated menstruous
               women because the household gods
               found the menstrual blood abhorrent.49</p>
               <p>An Ashanti “woman might not carve a
               stool—because of the ban against men-
               struation. A woman in this state was
               formerly not even allowed to approach
               wood-carvers while at work, on pain of
               death or of a heavy fine. This fine was
               to pay for sacrifices to be made upon
               the ancestral stools of dead kings, and
               also upon the wood-carver’s tools.
               Rattray believes that the abhorrence of
               the unclean woman “is based on the
               supposition that contact with her, di-
               rectly or indirectly, is held to negate
               and render useless all supernatural or
               magico-protective powers possessed by
               either persons or spirits or objects.
               Even by direct contact, therefore, an
               un-clean woman is capable of breaking
               down all barriers which stand between
               defenseless man and those evil unseen
               powers which beset him on every
               side.”5° This belief, with subtle varia-               
               tions, is common to all nonliterate cul-
               tures.</p>
               <p>Not only is there a tapu against men-
               strual blood, but, in addition, most
               male artists have to abstain from sexual
               intercourse because they believe it has
               an adverse effect on their work. In Oce-
               ania sexual intercourse can endanger or
               nullify a carver’s mana. In Africa an
               Anang carver will not have sexual inter-
               course the night before he begins an
               important carving because his work is
               impeded.5 “Too many acts of inter-
               course is thought to weaken him for a
               day or two, inhibit his desire to carve
               and his creative impulse, cause him to
               shape his pieces poorly, and lead him to
               cut himself."52 The carver's fear of               
               wounding himself, of bleeding, is a
               prominent concern which can relate to
               punishment, death and menstrua.

               that should the wife be unfaithful,

               <p>Warner Muensterberger (1951) was
               the first, to my knowledge, to address
               the issue of women’s exclusion in the
               arts of nonliterate cultures. His article
               emphasized why men felt it necessary
               to exclude women from the major art-
               making processes. In summing up he
               writes:</p>
               <quote>The overanxious exclusion of women
               discloses the regressive tendency in-
               volved. The artist relinquishes com-
               munication with an inhibiting or dis-
               turbing environment. Women are
               phobically avoided. . . . The regressive
               tendency for isolation is a security
               measure. Affect is being avoided. Ob-
               jective reality is denied while strength is
               gained from the narcissistic retreat to a
               level of omnipotent fantasy. ..
               these are the conditions under which
               artistic activity among primitive peo-
               ples is possible, then two seemingly
               contradictory tendencies are at work:
               the necessary isolation indicates that
               distance from the oedipal mother is
               sought. The menstruating woman is
               avoided or even dangerous. On the oth
               er hand, reunion with the giving
               mother of the preoedipal phase is
               wanted.</quote>
               <p>Muensterberger's Freudian interpre-
               tation is one viewpoint on the seemingl
               universal exclusion of women in the
               arena of “important arts. There are
               however, other ways to examine this
               phenomenon.</p>
               <p>The paradigm for the ritualized pro
               cess of man’s creations may be found in
               the cultural behavior of women durin,
               their menstrual cycles, pregnancy and
               childbirth. When men work on import
               ant objects, they usually do so in seclu
               sion or with other men of status. And
               should they carve in the sanctuary of
               the men’s house, this interior is often
               referred to as the womb.55 When wom-
               en have their menstrual period they us
               ually move to a special house of se-
               clusion or some equivalent; and in
               many cultures there is also a specia
               childbearing area. In these situations
               both the men and women are, in effect
               particularly powerful, negatively or
               positively, and must be removed from
               the realm of the ordinary. During the
               process of creation, both men (creating
               important objects) and women (creat
               ing human life) are subject to specific
               tapus imposed upon them for their own
               and their creation’s protection and the
               implied protection of others. These re
               strictions vary from culture to culture,
               but vulnerability in creation is common
               to both men and women in all nonliter
               ate cultures. If the tapus are broken
               men may cut themselves with their
               tools, miscarve a spiritless object or
               even die; women may miscarry, give
               birth to a dead or deformed child or die
               in labor.</p>
               <p>Analogous to this concept is the Poly-
               nesian belief that a new (art) object is
               comparable to a newborn child.</p>
               <quote>Like the child, the canoe, house, or oth-
               er object had a soul and a vital principle
               that required strengthening, for all ob
               jects were conscious and animate. ..
               It is evident that the new object, as a
               living being, needed the same kind oj
               rites to free and protect it against evil
               and to endow it with mana and othei
               necessary psychic qualities, as did the
               human infant.</quote>
               <p>In looking at other nonliterate cul-
               tures we can find parallels between the
               consecrating” of “important” objects
               and the consecration ceremonies for
               children, particularly the male infant.</p>
               <p>A final point concerns the “creativ
               ity” of male artists. George Kubler
               writes: “Many societies have accord-
               ingly proscribed all recognition of in
               ventive behavior, preferring to reward
               ritual repetition, rather than to permit
               inventive variations.”57 Under different
               situations, inventive variations can and
               do occur, but in the main, the ritualizec
               art process constrains innovation and
               free self-expression. Hieratic art em-
               phasizes repetition and encourages
               clever and ingenious manipulation of
               the iconographic elements within a giv-
               en iconography. Because women do not
               have their own ritualized process of art-
               making and their art is not hieratic, it
               follows that women artists can be more
               innovative and more self-expressive in
               the arts than men. Women, however
               are restricted in their use of materials
               and lack of specialized tools, but as typ-
               ified by the work of Abatan and Das-
               umi, they have a great deal of freedom
               in the way they interpret the existing
               iconographic elements and add on new,
               inventive iconographic elements.s
               suggest that the style and technique of
               the arts produced by women is a better
               indicator of the society’s changing no-
               tion of aesthetics than that of the arts
               produced by men. The objects made by
               women are used by everyone: as the
               culture’s aesthetic norm changes, the
               women’s art is the first to reflect this
               since these arts are nonhieratic. In the
               hieratic arts of men, an innovation con-
               joined with an aesthetic change intro-
               duces a state of anxiety as the artist's
               risk factor is high. To introduce an in-
               novative form, the male artist risks his
               religio-political status. He risks offend-
               ing the supernatural realm and the rul-
               ing chiefs. Male artists who do not
               work within a ritualized process and
               are not making hieratic art are apt to be
               the ones with lesser ability and are
               therefore not as reliable as a source of
               aesthetic notion.</p>
               <p>It appears, then, that women are be-
               lieved to have greater innate powers
               than men. Women have the power to
               create and control life. They control life
               through death as signified by the
               menses and abortion. Without children
               the family lineage dies, as do all the an-
               cestors who live in the supernatural
               world. The continuity between the
               present and the past is broken. Women
               are feared and respected for their cre-
               ative powers. Conversely, women who
               are barren lose status; in nonliterate
               cultures a barren woman is undisputed-
               ly grounds for divorce.
               To balance women’s innate powers,</p>
            
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_105.jpg" n="105" xml:id="img_0105"/>
            <p>
               men have created external powers that
               slowly became steeped in ritual and cer-
               emony and sanctioned by the authority
               of the supernatural realm. Women, in
               the main, were excluded from the rit-
               uals of men and more or less con-
               strained in their economic and political
               power. There are exceptions, including
               those women past child-bearing age
               who are viewed as men among
               women. The male artists rival the wom-
               en’s innate powers as both are in the
               position to manipulate the forces of cre-
               ation and continuity.</p>
               <p>How and why women were relegated
               to the less important arts is a gray area
               of conjecture; 1 do not believe it is a
               question of female preference. Rather,
               it is likely that the dominant male
               group has claimed the hieratic arts for
               itself consistently: the men make them
               because they are important and they
               are important because the men make
               them. Should the less dominant group
               (which shall remain unspecified) do
               something valuable, then the men will
               adopt that too. It has been a zero-sum
               game of distribution. The hieratic arts
               became instruments to articulate mean-
               ing structures and problems; in addi-
               tion they were a powerful way to con-
               trol women. Male hieratic art has been
               promoted in general by males to main-
               tain their own importance. It is no won-
               der that men, particularly in nonlit-
               erate cultures where women have
               achieved prominence on political, eco-
               nomic and even religious levels, have
               rarely, if ever, allowed the women to
               create the “important arts. The old
               belief systems bound by tradition are
               hard to break, as witnessed by the scar-
               city of contemporary women artists
               from the third world.</p>

               searching for her pigs, was forced to spend the
               night in a cave. “Her spirit went away in a dream
               and saw a house in which goblins were at work
               plaiting a sun. She saw how it was made, anc
               when they had finished she returned back to her
               home, and then showed her knowledge to the
               men of the village. When they had learned exact
               ly how to make a sun, they hanged the woman, to
               punish her for dealing with sacred matters. To-
               day the oara is sacred and women must not see it.
               Even a glimpse of it meant death for a woman.

               of this type are interesting; it is possible that the

               make string-figure art; the string figures are an
               example of no-status art as it is mainly a “wom-
               an’s pastime.” However, when the men make str-
               ing figures it is useful. Nevertheless, as an essen-
               tially women’s art the string figures reveal a

               new string game designs but do not tell the men
               about them. One Yirrkalia woman, Narau, had
               a repertoire of over 170 string figures, many of
