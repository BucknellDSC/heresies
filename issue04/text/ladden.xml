               says Fascinating Womanhood, which ranks self-effacement
               with God and the flag, “remember, when you cast your bread

               the martyred woman today: passive and awed by powerful

            <p>
               A look at early Christian history shows that woman’s lot was
               anything but a lot. Man’s marriage to woman was grudg
               ingly conceded as a necessary evil.1 She was a “foe to friend
               ship, an inevitable penance . . . a domestic peril.”2 It was
               officially questioned whether woman had a soul (in 585, the
               Council of Macon decided that she did, but only by a single
               vote).? Repeatedly admonished to “be in subjection to (her
               own husband,”4 she was, at best, “a natural temptation, a
               ”5 A weak vessel for man s seed, she was a
               coveted calamity.
               plaque on which he could mount his sexual organ.</p>
               <p>For the religious woman, who naturally believed her life
               worthless, there were few alternatives. She could dumbly
               worship the saints or, if ambitious enough, she could emulate
               them: St. Simon Stylites ate very little; St. John of the Cross
               licked the sores of lepers.° And while some women performec
               no less austerely (St. Rose ate nothing but sheep’s gall, ashes
               and bitter herbs, and she drank the blood of a sick patient),
               many—martyred through constant devotion and sacrifice-
               displayed a peculiar brand of sensuality.</p>
               <p>Veronica Guliani—who went to bed with, and kissed, and
               suckled a lamb, the lamb being a symbol of Christ—is per
               haps atypical. But not Mechthilde of Madgeburg, who pre-
               ferred to see Jesus as “charming,” affectionate and 18 years
               old. Nor Margaretha of Ypern, who thought herself “en-
               gaged” to Jesus. Nor Christine Ebner, who imagined she
               carried Jesus’ child. The church deliberately inspired such
               sensuous imaginings. “Ever let the Bridegroom sport with
               will put his hand through the hole in the door and will touch
               With nuns “marrying” Christ in a formal
               your belly ...
               ceremony—their “1 love Christ into whose bed I have en
               tered” being roughly equivalent to the modern “I do”—it is
               not surprising that, while most martyrs sought to transcend
               the body, female martyrdom at times unveiled a complexion
               entirely its own. Pocked with the scars of lacerations and
               burnings, flushed with desire for a polygamous, heterosexual
               Jesus, it encouraged a centuries-long tradition of woman's
               self-sacrifice and suffering for man. For only by cleaving to a
               seeming savior or holy man could a woman hope to rise even
               a fraction as much as she had fallen.</p>
              <p> Take the example of Margaret-Mary Alacoque, a particu
               larly fervent practitioner. She shafted a novice for rivaling
               her holiness, lest she rival her also in the Savior’s affections.
               And while her frequent convulsions were probably due to
               austerity—she drank mostly dirty wash-water, and drank
               nothing at all from Thursday to Sunday (though she occas-
               ionally licked up vomit with her tongue)—she was hotly fe
               verish with love of Jesus, even tattooing his name on hei
               chest with a small knife. (When the scars healed, she burned
               in the insignia with a candle.) Such actions were proof of a
               beautiful soul.</p>
               <p>Suffering has long been a value in the west. An attribute of
               saints and a must for martyrs, it has also lately been required
               of the artist, who, as Susan Sontag aptly notes, now replaces
               the saint as exemplary sufferer.” And Sontag’s tenet, 1 think,
               can be reversed: the saint, or martyr, was a kind of artist in
               earlier times. Aestheticians like Jacques Maritain would
               seem to agree, seeing art as “makling) a form shine on the
               matter,” form being “the profound splendor of the soul shin
               ing through .. . the principle . . . of pain and passion.” Liv
               ing in true perfection, he says, “may be metaphorically de-
               scribed as an art . . . an art which only the saints mastei
               fully.</p>
               <p>Now, that Margaret-Mary wasn’t perfect is not impor-
               tant; it’s enough that the church assures us she was. What is
               important is that she was an exemplary sufferer if there ever
               was one. She suffered; she suffered wholly and completely
               and this gave her a decided advantage. For, notes Sontag,
               quoting from the diary of a suffering artist, only through
               such total surrender can we “disarm the power of suffering 
               make it our own creation, our own choice,”1° By giving in to
               suffering, we mold it, reshape it. We sublimate suffering into
               art.</p>
               <p>That life and art can be one and the same is an old idea.
               John Dewey” upheld it, defining art as any activity reshap-
               ing experience more meaningfully, coherently and vividly
               than ordinary life allows. “Emotion,” he says, “is . . . the
               cementing force.” By selecting and coloring, it unifies the
               disparate events of experience, transforming them into an
               experience. “The enemies of the aesthetic, says Dewey,
               are neither the practical or the intellectual. They are the
               hum-drum.</p>
               <p>However repugnant Margaret-Mary’s actions may seem
               by male aesthetic criteria Margaret-Mary was an artist and
               her martyrdom was art. It dictated her every action, and her
               every action was contrived to reflect a beautiful soul.
               Martyrdom provided her with a form for her life, and
               through it she assumed control over the fragmented matter of
               her existence. She indulged in suffering; it engrossed her,
               diverted her, and thoroughly absorbed her. Pain became
               objectified. Life became a passionate performance (indeed.
               her breast resembled a theater marquee), soulful, dramatic
               cohesive, consistent and meaningful. By classical definitions
               of art, her life, in assuming a magnitude and order, fulfilled
               the conditions of the beautiful. In fact, martyrdom for Jesus,
               and later secularized martyrdom for man, has been one of
               woman’s most pervasive and enduring traditional art forms.</p>
               <p>For Margaret-Mary was not alone in indulging in suf
               fering; other women matched her passion. Christine Ebner
               etched out a cross on the skin of her chest and tore it off.
               Mary Magdalene dei Pazzi had herself cut, trampled.
               whipped and burned. Christine of St. Trond had herself
               bound, hung, racked, buried and baked. Surely, Christian-
               ity’s chapter on the martyrs and mystics is one of the most
               astounding chapters in history. Less astounding, perhaps.
               are the women who, like Felicula or Saints Agnes and
               Agatha, opted for tortures over marriage. These women were
               saving themselves for Christ and wouldn’t succumb. But
               there were also martyrs among those who did, like Therese, a
               nineteenth century madwoman and would-be mystic whose
               longing for Christ drove her insane until finally, distracted,
               demoralized and institutionalized, she wrote: “Now I only
               believe in God and suffering. I feel it is necessary to get mar-
               ried.”12 Therese was deranged, but her resignation reflected
               a sordid truth: for many who lived in later centuries, mar
               riage itself had become yet another form of martyrdom,
               supplying an aesthetic where none existed.</p>
               <p>The altruistic female sacrificing for a husband was an old
               ideal. The twelfth-century Marie de France featured her in
               Eliduc where a wife graciously surrenders her husband to a
               woman he loves. Years later, she welcomes the new wife into
               her convent where, sisters in Christ, the two women are
               bound again by love for a single man, the husband and
               Christ being, metaphorically, one and the same</p>
               <p>By the fourteenth century, with Chaucer s and Boccac-
               cio’s patient Griselda, the emphasis had changed.13 A female
               Job, Griselda stands obediently by while her husband humil
               iates her, repudiates her—even when she believes he mur
               dered her children; her only concern is to meet his wants,
               however cruel they seem to her. Now the love of one woman
               for another is strongly de-emphasized—relief can only come
               from man—and man s worth is wholly unquestioned, wom
               an s soul seeming all the greater for his cruelty.</p>
               <p>It was this ideal which began to flourish in the eighteenth
               century. Because Protestantism had changed woman s role,
               transposing mystical values to the domestic sphere, latei
               centuries saw the revival of the martyrdom aesthetic in a new
               light. Aestheticians since Fichte had taught that beauty was
               subjective—a manifestation of the beautiful soul—many be
               lieving, with Muller, that the highest art was the art of life.
               Now, soulful woman could approach the sublime without ev-</p>

            <p>
               er leaving her immediate neighborhood, not to mention fore-
               going a trip to heaven. Just as, classically, art was a lofty
               reflection of nature, the good wife was a lofty reflection of
               man, so lofty in fact, that she ceased to have substance alto-
               gether (a Dorsetshire wedding ceremony likened her to “
               Mirrour which hath no image of its own”).15 A young girl
               (pupilla) was said to exist in the pupil of every man’s eye,16
               and while this classically meant man s perceptions were soul-
               ful, now it stood for another tenet: that woman should only
               exist in the glazed eyes of man. She was wife only—merely a
               part of her husband’s family, famulus meaning servant on
               slave. As Fichte had also taught: “[Woman’s) own dignity
               requires that she should give herself up entirely as she is . .
               and should utterly lose herself in (her husband).”17</p>
               <p>Now Christ was absent. As with Jane Eyre in the Bronte
               novel, woman was to persist dutifully in soulful devotion to a
               cynical master and, eventually, his contemplation of her-
               distanced and mystical in her suffering goodness—might
               touch his soul and effect his overt transformation. Just as
               Jane restored the blinded Rochester’s vision, so could wom-
               an, like the highest art, elevate a husband’s vision, turning
               cynic into believer, teaching and delighting. A classical rep-
               resentation of beauty, she incited compassion and pity, if not
               fear.</p>
               <p>But such idealizations were fiction, pure fairy tale.
               Bronte’s Jane was, in real life, de Sade’s Justine. A perpetual
               victim, she often suffered for men who were unrelenting,
               unrepenting.</p>
               <p>With religious executions a thing of the past and passion-
               ate martyrdom for Christ wholly repugnant to the Protestant
               ethic, the clergy, who now found marriage desirable, trans-
               ferred the imagery of Jesus onto the husband with new, if
               pedestrian, significance. The female martyr was now
               plunked down in the family cottage where, virtuous and sex-
               less, she suffered for her family. There, mystical and beauti-
               ful, she persevered. Determined and powerless, she perse-
               vered. John Ruskin’s directive was typical: “(Woman must
               be) instinctively, infallibly wise—wise, not for self-develop-
               ment, but for self-renunciation.</p>
               <p>In fact, she hadn’t much choice. The rise of capitalism
               had, by the eighteenth century, aggravated woman s econ-
               omic dependence while it banished traditional duties from
               the home. Domestic spinning, weaving, brewing and baking
               had once been essential and, however tedious, had used up
               time. Now, with moral prohibitions still further diminishing
               woman’s activities, idleness exposed the void. By roman-
               tically and utterly surrendering to suffering, woman might
               become absorbed; life’s form might assume a grandiose
               beauty, masking the pettiness of its content. As before, il
               woman could exalt her suffering, she could shape it, perfect
               it; she could languish in contemplation of her own sorrow.
               Formalized and ritualized, it aesthetically formed and in-
               formed her life. And the aesthetic became an anaesthetic
               For no matter how sentient martyrdom’s manifestations, it
               numbed woman to her own insignificance, protecting hei
               from the more genuine pain of small emotions. The niggling
               void became flushed with feeling, feeling believed to soften
               and deepen the soul. Or so believed Madame de Stael, whose
               exposition on suffering also credited the virtues of habitual
               submisiveness. Her tract was written to justify suicide. No
               wonder.19</p>
               <p>Martyrdom was still an art: no longer for Jesus, no longer
               even for a powerful man whose cruelty masked a beautiful
               soul. It was now martyrdom for any man, be he a stern patri-
               arch or a sodden drunk, or a stemn patriarch and a sodden
               drunk. As Tolstoy saw it: Wives should be loving, unobtru-
               sive and unassuming—“comforters of the drunken, the
               weak, and the dissolute.”2° Or in Fichte’s words: The wife of
               a degenerate husband “is held all the more in esteem the gen-
           
           
               . . . she bears it,” though still, she must appear to be
               “lost in the man of her choice.”21 Wet nurses to alcoholics,
               wives soaked their men with spirit, and disappeared.
               In 1920, in a perverse tribute to pained sensibility, Mar-
               garet-Mary Alacoque was canonized. Her emblem was the
               Sacred Heart. It was increasingly presented more and more
               bloodily—grotesque, fiery, disembodied, now an isolate
               lump of throbbing muscle—the pulsing symbol of a female
               aesthetic and the badge of hundreds of Catholic schools.
               The good woman, it thumps, is all heart.</p>
               <p>But its beat is getting ever weaker. Like the allure of habit-
               ual sacrifice itself. Like the utter devotion (submission) for
               which it stands—one passion, indivisible, with guilt and op-
               pression for all. Woman’s fluid acquiescence has leaked its
               glamour, and women are letting women know it.
               Sacrifice is self-abuse. Death to martyrdom.</p>

               very point: she cannot rationally will to be free.” In other words, any wom-
               an who chooses freedom is necessarily irrational; thus, she cannot sensibly
               assess her motives or use her freedom. It is curiously circular reasoning.</p>
