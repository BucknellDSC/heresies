            <p>
               "Even more important than the discovery of Columbus,
               which we are gathered to celebrate, is the fact that the Government
               has just discovered women.” These words were voiced not by a
               present-day feminist but by Bertha Honoré Palmer, a wealthy
               Chicago socialite, at the dedication ceremonies of the World’s Co
               lumbian Exposition in October 1892. While the Fair did indeed
               mark the 400th anniversary of Columbus’s discovery of the New
               World, more importantly it became the site of an international
               forum of women artists, writers, educators, scientists and craftsper
               sons. Government recognition, although not enthusiastic, aided the
               construction of the Woman’s Building and the establishment of the
               Woman’s Branch of the Auxiliary Congress which served as a public
               podium for the discussion of women’s status and rights.</p>
               <p>In fact, the very existence of the Woman’s Building can be credit-
               ed largely to feminists active in the late 1800s. For instance, in
               January 1890, when the United States Congress was considering
               establishing the Fair, Susan B. Anthony and other prominent fem-
               inists urged the Senate to guarantee women an active role in its plan-
               ning. As a token gesture a Board of Lady Managers was authorized,
               and although it had as many members as the men’s Columbian
               Commission, the latter actually ran the Fair. Nonetheless, the
               Woman’s Department of the Exposition, responsible for the Wo-
               man’s Building, its contents and overall management, was legally
               recognized and funded by the United States Government.</p>
               <p>Despite a certain second-class status, the women who par-
               ticipated in and managed portions of the Fair wielded considerable
               authority. One of the major reasons for this was the presence of Ber-
               tha Honore Palmer, President of the Board of Lady Managers, who
               was appointed to oversee the day-to-day operation of the Woman’s
               Building and the Auxiliary Congress. She was the wife of a powerful
               Chicago millionaire, Potter Palmer, the builder of Chicago s famous
               Palmer House, who, not coincidentally, was a promoter of the Fair
               and one of its largest financial sponsors. Bertha Palmer, however,
               was an extraordinary woman in her own right. Her participation in
               the Exposition and that of other wealthy and socially prominent
               women, including textile designer and educator Candace Thurber
               Wheeler, in the Exposition’s work, helped elevate the view of
               women’s art so that it was no longer viewed as an amateurish
               domestic hobby but as a serious endeavor.</p>
               <p>But there was another reason for American women’s finally being
               included in so auspicious a gathering as a World’s Fair. With the
               rapid rise of industrialization in America following the Civil War
               Washington found it politic to become officially involved with wom-
               en’s employment in industry if not full female suffrage.</p>
               <p>While critics of feminism maintained that woman’s status was
               rooted in her economic dependence on man, one unalterable fact re
               mained: the rise of industrialization required a larger labor force to
               operate mass-production machinery than could be supplied by
               males. Women filled that gap. Thus, the number of women working
               for pay outside the home doubled from four to eight million between
               1890 and 1910; a previously untapped economic resource was now
               being utilized. In addition, industrialization and invention of the
               telephone, typewriter and telegraph created the need for the office
               girl.</p>
            <p>
               The Industrial Revolution also had profound social implications.
               In search of jobs young women (most of them single), like young
               men, flocked to large urban centers. Upon arriving in the city their
               social status immediately and perceptibly changed. Young, alone
               and economically independent, they were freed of their age-old
               dependence on home and family. Thrown together for the first time,
               these women forged close ties of friendship, and before long discov-
               ered by acting in consort they could be a powerful political force
               One of their very first actions was to agitate for the right to vote,
               which was then denied them.</p>
               <p>The Woman’s Department was, from the outset, plagued with
               difficulties. As work progressed on the Fair, the government backed
               away from its original commitment to the Woman’s Building and
               individual states had to assume the responsibility for funding its
               various exhibits. As a result, the Woman’s Building, one of the
               smallest at the Exposition, was granted only 8200,000 for its
               construction out of an estimated total of $12,700,000 budgeted for
               grounds and buildings. In addition, most of the women artists rep-
               resented in the Woman’s Building not only contributed their time
               and work free, but also had to absorb shipping and installation costs
               for displays of their work; men whose works were commissioned
               were usually paid in advance.</p>
               <p>Other forms of blatant discrimination continually hampered the
               efforts of the Board of Lady Managers and eventually determined
               the use to which the Woman’s Building was put. The building was
               not originally intended to be used for exhibit space; it was planned
               as the headquarters for women connected with the Fair. But, as
               Bertha Palmer noted: the building “. . . has been forced into that
               relation with the rest of the Exposition because of the partial exclu-
               sion of women elsewhere.”2</p>
               <p>Bertha Palmer summarized the difficulties the women had en-
               countered in an address she delivered at the opening of the
               Woman’s Building: “We have been obliged to march with peace of-
               ferings lest hostile motives be ascribed to us.”3 She went on to ad-
               vocate the liberation of women and made it clear that the Woman’s
               Building and its contents represented opportunities to advance the
               cause of women’s rights, especially those of working women. She
               said, perhaps with tongue in cheek:</p>
               <quote>Without touching upon politics, suffrage, or other irrelevant is-
               sues, this unique organization of women for women will devote itselj
               to the formation of a public sentiment which will favor woman’s in
               dustrial equality, secure for her work the consideration and respect
               which it deserves, and establish her importance as an economic fac-
               tor. To this end it will endeavor to obtain and install in these
               buildings exhibits showing the value of her contributions to the in-
               dustries, sciences and arts, as well as statistics giving the proportion-
               ate amount of her work in every country.4</quote>
               <p>In order to fulfill this commitment, the organizers included as
               part of the exhibition records of women’s professional and economic
               status, reports from social, industrial and cooperative associations
               and a compilation of statistics on women’s legal, social, political and
               economic status in countries throughout the world. It was the aim of
               the Board to see that this information was “. . . placed on record as</p>
            
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_048.jpg" n="48" xml:id="img_0048"/>
            <p>
               public documents among the archives of every country.”5 The
               Woman’s Department further supplied information to women on
               employment possibilities and training. It was the first time that such
               a comprehensive survey of women s activities and conditions in
               every part of the world had been made. The overall impact of this
               contribution still has not been fully evaluated.</p>
               <p>Another far-reaching and innovative idea was the Children’s
               Building. It was conveniently located next to the Woman’s Building
               and provided a place for women to leave their children safely in the
               hands of a trained staff for a small fee while they viewed the exhibits
               at the Fair. The Children’s Building contained a large gymnasium,
               a library, a workshop, a nursery and several other departments. The
               workshop contained every kind of machine and mechanical device,
               giving both boys and girls an opportunity to learn how to use tools
               and develop their mechanical abilities. As such, it is probably the
               earliest example of a day-care center. Like other projects organizec
               by women at the Fair, the Children’s Building was given no money
               by the Exposition authorities and was completely financed by the
               Board of Lady Managers.</p>
               <p>The architect for the Woman’s Building was Sophia G. Hayden.
               In 1890, she became the first woman to complete the four-year
               course in architecture (with honors) from the Massachusetts In-
               stitute of Technology. Hayden’s design was selected from twelve
               others and she began supervision of the building’s construction in
               July 1891. She designed her building in the neoclassic style which
               was enjoying a revival at the time and was required by the Exposi-
               tion committee.</p>
               <p>The elaborately ornamental Hall of Honor formed the spine of the
               structure and rose to the building’s full two-story height. Sixty-seven
               and a half feet wide and 200 feet long, it was topped by a skylight.
               The Hall of Honor was reserved for the core of the fine arts exhibits
               in the Woman’s Building. The major decoration of this important
               room was left to six American artists: Mary Cassatt, Mary Mac
               Monnies, Lucia-Fairchild Fuller, Amanda Brewster Sewall, Rosina
               Emmett Sherwood and Lydia Emmett.</p>
               <p>Sherwood and Emmett were sisters who had both studied with
               William Merritt Chase at the Art Students’ League in New York
               and later in Paris at the Julian Academy. Sherwood’s mural was ti-
               tled, “The Republic’s Welcome to Her Daughters.” Her sister’s
               mural, “Music, Art and Literature, showed the three disciples
               personified by three female figures. Fairchild-Fuller, a Bostonian,
               had also studied with Chase at the League and was a successful min-
               iature painter. Her mural, “The Women of Plymouth, depicted
               Pilgrim women and children engaged in domestic chores. Sewall
               was born in upstate New York, studied at Cooper Union and with
               Chase and William Sartain at the League in Paris. For her mural,
               Women in Arcadia, she was awarded a bronze medal by the Co-
               lumbian Commission.</p>
               <p>The two most famous women artists participating in the
               building’s decoration were MacMonnies and Cassatt. MacMon-
               nies’s 60-foot mural, “Primitive Woman,” located on the north tym-
               panum of the Hall of Honor, was one of the largest ever painted by a
               woman. It was divided into three sections that illustrated the roles of
               ancient women as wives, mothers and workers. Cassatt’s commis-
               sion to decorate the south tympanum on the subject of modern
               woman was her first commission in America and her first attempt at
               mural decoration. Cassatt’s space was identical to MacMonnies’s,
               but Cassatt divided her mural into three separate panels with three
               allegorical themes. The central and largest panel was “Young
               Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge and Science.” In the
               right-hand panel were three women who personified the “Arts,
               Music and Dancing, and in the left-hand panel were “Young Girls
               Pursuing Fame.</p>
               <p>Also decorating the Hall of Honor were murals and paintings,
               etchings and engravings contributed by American, German, Austri-
               an, English, French and Spanish women. In addition, sculpture
               and numerous handicrafts were displayed. There was even a bas-
               relief entitled “Ophelia made by the famous French actress, Sarah
               Bernhardt. Finally, names of important women from around the
               world in the arts, sciences, literature and other disciplines were
               recorded.</p>
               <p>Running along the easterly side of the Hall of Honor were rooms
               largely devoted to the technological side of women’s contributions.
               Among these rooms were two Scientific rooms, an Inventions room
               and an Educational room.</p>
               <p>Passing through the corridors, the visitor could then enter the
               Northern Pavilion (on the north side of the building) or the South-
               ern Pavilion (on the south side). In the Northern Pavilion were ex-
               hibits from countries such as Russia, Australia and England. The
               Russian section was especially notable. A remarkable reproduction
               of a Byzantine gate of the twelfth century marked the entrance. It
               was made of oak and joined together without a single nail. The
               wood surface was overlaid with gold leaf. The work was designed
               and constructed solely by Russian women. Exhibits of cottage
               industries from Scotland and Ireland included hand-knitted stock-
               ings and gloves, shawls and ecclesiastical vestments, as well as many
               fine examples of embroidery and needlework. Examples of uniquely
               Irish lacemaking techniques could be seen in displays of Irish point
               lace, Limerick lace and Carrickmacross lace. The Northern
               Pavilion also included exhibits of stained glass designs, wallpaper
               and silk designs, book-cover designs and book illustrations, con-
               tributed by American and foreign women.</p>
               <p>The most notable exhibit in the Northern Pavilion was that of
               American Applied Arts. The handicraft contributions (specifically,
               needlework and embroidery) of the Associated Artists Society, one
               of the first American schools of embroidery and design, as well as
               the woven textiles and tapestries, were among the best examples of
               handwork in the Woman s Building. This exhibit had been organ-
               ized by Candace Thurber Wheeler, who lent her considerable ar-
               tistic and managerial talents to the Woman’s Building and oversaw
               its interior decoration. It is fair to say that the American renaissance
               in embroidery and needlework was initiated and largely affected by
               Wheeler. Thanks to her perseverance and clout, needlework ex-
               hibits at the Columbian Exposition were no longer predominantly
               English or European, as they had been in the Centennial Exposition
               seventeen years earlier.</p>
               <p>Walking along the Loggia for a breath of fresh air and a fine
               overall view of the Exposition grounds, the visitor could then tour</p>
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_049.jpg" n="49" xml:id="img_0049"/>
            <p>
               the Southern Pavilion which was devoted to exhibits of lacemaking,
               embroidery, fan painting, jewelry, silverware, carved wood, leather
               and fans. These exhibits came from France, Italy, Mexico, Japan
               Spain, Belgium, Austria, Germany, Sweden and Norway, as well as
               far-off places such as Siberia, Siam, Ceylon, Brazil and the Cape of
               Good Hope. One of the most popular exhibits was that organized by
               the Japanese Woman’s Commission. Two rooms of a typical
               Japanese dwelling were carefully reproduced. The inclusion of such
               details as fine inlaid boxes, polished steel mirrors and a woman’s
               boudoir gave the spectator a true sense of having actually visited a
               Japanese home. Another exhibit of special interest was the collec
               tion of lace sent by Queen Margherita of Italy which traced the
               history of lacemaking in that country as well as in all other lace-
               making countries.</p>
               <p>The elevator, a welcome feature of the building at this point of the
               tour, would then whisk the visitor to the gallery floor of the
               building, which contained exhibits primarily from the United
               States.</p>
               <p>Running along the east wall of the gallery floor were the Californ-
               ia, Cincinnati, Kentucky and Japanese rooms (the Japanese exhib-
               ited here as well as in the Southern Pavilion). The California room
               was warmly inviting with its ceilings, doors and wainscoting all
               made of rich, mellow redwood. The room was decorated with
               stained glass designed and executed by American women.</p>
               <p>The Cincinnati room, the largest and most important room of this
               section of the gallery, served as the Managers’ Drawing Room. Its
               display of pottery executed by Cincinnati women underscored
               women’s unique contributions to the craft. Of special interest was
               Rookwood Pottery, an adaptation of the art nouveau style with flat,
               linear floral patterns and varied glazes—all of which had gainec
               Rookwood an international reputation for fine ceramics craftsman-
               ship. In addition to examples of Rookwood Pottery decorated by
               the Rookwood Pottery founder, Mrs. Maria Longworth Nichols 
               Storer, there were pieces created by members of the Cincinnati Pot-
               tery Club. M. Louise McLaughlin, founder of the Pottery Club in
               1879, had developed an unusual method of underglaze painting and
               “Losanti Ware, a hard porcelain with a feldspathic glaze fired at a
               low temperature. Examples of her work were included in the Cin-
               cinnati room exhibit.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the most important room, next to the Hall of Honor, was
               the Library, located directly opposite the Cincinnati room on the
               west side of the gallery. The interior decoration, including the dark,
               carved oak bookcases, was the work of Candace Thurber Wheeler,
               Dora Wheeler Keith, her daughter, decorated the Library’s ceiling.
               She chose an allegorical theme appropriate to the room: a male
               figure represented Science; Literature was personified by a woman
               standing beside Science, and Imagination, also a female figure,
               stood between the two, symbolizing the reconciliation and binding
               of one to the other. More importantly, the Library contained over
               7,000 volumes of American and foreign women’s writings (including
               such great authors as Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, George Eliot,
               the poetess Harriet Monroe, Louisa Alcott and Susan B. Anthony
               making it the largest such collection at that time. Two Records
               rooms flanked the Library and contained statistics of woman’s work
               in several countries.</p>
               <p>Also located on this side of the gallery was the English Training
               School for Nurses. It was a model of a room for the instruction of
               nurses and contained all sorts of medical and surgical instruments
               along with portraits of women who were famous for their contri-
               butions to nursing and medicine, such as Florence B. Nightingale.
               After visiting the English Training School for Nurses, the fair-
               goer could walk through the north corridor to the Assembly Room
               which was used for meetings, lectures and concerts, and then on to
               the large Model Kitchen. The kitchen was equipped with the most
               modern appliances then available and staffed with teachers who in-
               structed women in the science of preparing nutritional foods and
               even in preparing Indian corn.</p>
               <p>The visitor might pleasantly end the tour by resting and dining in
               the garden cafe of the Woman’s Building—a quiet oasis in green in
               which, reputedly, the best food at the Fair was to be found.
               The significance of the exhibits of the Woman’s Building was
               multifaceted. By making the achievements of many fine women art-
               ists and craftswomen more widely known, they corrected miscon-
               ceptions about women’s artistic abilities and made it clear that
               women held an important place in the history of the arts. In addi-
               tion, the Woman’s Building provided a forum for presenting the
               theme of the changing roles of women. Facts were available for
               public and personal consumption, and as they cut across social and
               class barriers, must have had a considerable impact on both sexes.
               For women, especially, the new sense of history, pride and ac
               complishment alone was worth the long and arduous struggle to
               make their building and its contents public.</p>
