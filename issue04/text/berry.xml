   <head><title>Quill Art</title></head>   
   <byline>Carolyn Berry</byline>
   <p>
               Quillwork, the decoration of anima.
               skins with dyed and natural porcupine
               quills, was unique to North American
               Indian culture and practiced only by
               women. This art form probably origin-
               ated in the Great Lakes area and the
               surrounding woodlands. As white inva-
               sion and colonization intensified, the
               various tribes of corn farmers originally
               inhabiting the area migrated west to the
               Plains where eventually their culture
               centered on buffalo hunting. The Chey-
               enne were one such tribe who brought
               with them women s ancient art of quill-
               work.</p>
               <p>A balance of power existed within
               Cheyenne society. Chiefs were men,
               but there were memories of women’s
               holding this position. Cheyenne society
               was matrilineal. Women owned the
               tipis in which they lived with their hus-
               band, daughters, daughters’ husbands
               and unmarried sons. A wealthy man
               could have more than one wife; fre-
               quently sisters married the same man.
               If the first wife didn’t approve of her
               husband’s choice she could divorce
               him, although she might commit sui-
               cide (by hanging herself with her
               braids). Chastity was highly honored;
               girls and women wore the chastity rope.
               Seduction and rape were extremely rare
               (as was murder). Girls puberty was
               celebrated ritually, and women main-
               tained their own societies, traditions,
               religious beliefs and secular position.
               Sharing of work by women made possi-
               ble the long hours necessary for such a
               precise and painstaking art as quill-
               work.</p>
               <p>Quills, obtained from porcupines
               which the men hunted, were removed
               promptly, sorted into different sizes
               and stored in bladder bags. The largest
               and coarsest quills, taken from the tail,
               were used in broad masses of embroid-
               ery. Medium quills came from the back
               of the animal and small ones from the
               neck. The finest were taken from the
               belly and were used for the most deli-
               cate lines so noticeable in the exquisite
               work to be found in early specimens.
               After sorting, the quills were boiled
               with natural dyes usually found locally,
               although Cheyenne would travel great
               distances to find plants needed for par-
               ticular colors. Dye stuffs included
               moss, stones, buffalo-berries, wild
               grapes, cattails, oak bark and many
               other barks, flowers and seeds. The in-
               gredients and process were often kept
               secret. Eventually quills were colored
               with commercial dyes or soak-
               Pair of quilled moccasins
               ed with dyed trade cloth.</p>
               <p>Quills were sewn onto skins Indian, Heye
               tanned by the women; in this
               Foundation
               process, many days long, the
               skin was stretched, scraped,
               bleached, softened and
               stretched once again. Tanning
               tools were handed down by
               women from generation to
               generation. After tanning the
               skins, the woman would cut
               and shape the leather into the object
               she intended to embroider with quills.</p>
               <p>As she worked, the woman held a
               supply of quills in her mouth to soften
               them so they could be flattened. Since
               they would split if punctured, quills
               were held to the skin between rows of
               stitches or with a stitch over each quill.
               Sinew, dried black grass and fine roots
               were used for sewing. The sinew thread
               was kept moist except for one end,
               which was licked, twisted and let dry to
               stiffen. This was then threaded through
               holes made in the hide with an awl. Ex-
               tra sewing supplies were carried in a
               quill-decorated purse trappers called
               possible-sacks, in which women also
               kept small ornaments, medicine, count-
               ers for gambling, plum stones for the
               seed game and clothes for small child-
               ren.</p>
               <p>Countless articles for daily and ritual
               use were embroidered with quills: to-
               bacco and tinder bags, work bags,
               knife cases, cradles, burden straps,
               moccasins, shirts, leggings, arm and leg
               bands, robes, horse trappings, dresses,
               deerskin rolls for braided hair, lodge
               linings, stars for lodges, back-rests, pil-
               lows, lodge sacks, flutes, saddles
               combs, stick rattles for dancing and
               ceremonial gift pipes.</p>
               <p>The two distinct natural surfaces-
               the soft tanned hide and the stiff col-
               ored quills—made an extraordinary
               and beautiful art form. The quills were
               shiny, almost translucent, as if some
               spirit of the animal remained. Later
               when beads were used in many of the
               ancient quill patterns, old people often
               complained that they had no life, that
               beads were dead. Though quills were
               individually small, the mass of a rope
               decorated with them was large and
               glowing, colorfully accentuating the
               wearer's movements.</p>
               <p>Quillwork was not only beautiful but
               conveyed important symbols. To a               
               considerable extent each article de-
               corated had a characteristic design
               which bore some relation to the use of
               the article or the attributes of its
               owner.””3 A quilled bag for a baby to
               handle was suspended from an elabo-
               rately quilled baby-carrier. The bag               
               contained the child’s umbilical cord
               and was carried for her or his life on the
               left side.</p>
               <p>Some designs were specific to either
               women or men. Turtle designs were
               worn only by women. They were “used
               on the yoke of a woman s dress and leg-
               gings and at the head or side of the ba-
               by-carrier or cradle . . . as a talisman.
               The U-shaped design below the yoke of
               the woman s dress represented the
               breast of the turtle, the wing-like exten-
               sions corresponding to the sides of the
               shell. Used symbolically the turtle de-
               sign had power over the diseases pecu-
               liar to women and also over birth and
               infancy.”</p>
               <p>The red line, much used in both
               quill and beadwork, was known as the
               life span or the trail on which woman
               travels, and was regarded as symbolic
               of that portion of a woman s life during
               which children may be born. Red lines
               or stripes on articles used by women
               were often associated with womens
               functions and virtues and symbolized
               the good life.”5 The face of a girl at her
               first menstrual period was painted with
               red lines (or she might be painted red
               all over). Red lines around the edge of a
               lodge indicated that people coming into
               the camp would be fed by the women
               living there.</p>
               <p>In Cheyenne quillwork the majority
               of designs were abstract. They “had
               significance above specific happenings
               and were related to religion. These de-
               signs were composed of symbols which
               followed the pure geometric forms
               woman s art). Later they acquired a
               protective connotation in which a cir-
               cle, spiral or some other motif repre-
               sented the power which would offer
               magical aid or give comfort to the one
               for whom the needlework was made.
               Circles representing the ancient sacred
               circle were used in both women’s and
               men s'art. Women added quilled circles
               to robes as holy protective objects.</p>
               <p>In the art of the Cheyenne (and the
               Sioux) a spiderweb design was quilled
               onto a child’s robe by a medicine wom-
               an as a symbol of power and future
               well-being. Since a spider s work fre-
               quently has been a metaphor for
               women s weaving and embroidery, this
               recurrent design may have had symbol
               ic importance for the Cheyenne. The
               analysis of women s iconography has
               been overlooked in most descriptions of
               their work, which also discount the
               women s style as merely decorative
               because it is abstract.</p>
               <p>When Americans or others
               commissioned an Indian woman to
               quill or bead an object, they often
               expected a replica of something
               beautiful they had seen and ad-
               mired. The showman Buffalo Bill
               asked a famous Cheyenne woman,
               “The Bead Woman, to make a dec-
               orated shirt for him, but was unhap-
               py with it because it was a floral de-
               sign. When he ordered another one</p>

            <p>
               from another Cheyenne woman he was
               again disappointed. He was not aware
               that “the Cheyenne designs are a sa-
               cred trust that comes down the wom-

               <p>As quillworkers women participated
               in creating ritually important objects.
               They worked with the men in the crea-
               tion of scalp shirts which held the hair
               of enemies killed and horses wounded
               in battle. Only the bravest men could
               possess them, and only the most moral
               women decorated them. Men hunted
               the animal and women tanned the skin.
               Men painted the shirt and women quill-
               ed or beaded the panels with sacred de-
               signs. Each did the work under strict
               supervision of an honored person of
               their sex who had done the work before
               and was ritually approved.</p>
               <p>Sacred quillwork was permitted only
               to members of the Quillworkers Society
               which, like the Women’s War Society,
               consisted of the most courageous and
               skilled women, known as Mon in i heo,
               the selected ones.1° Quillwork “must be
               done in prescribed ceremonial fashion.
               and the (initiate must be taught to per-
               form it by some member Jof the Socie-
               tyj who had previously done the same
               thing. The making and offering of such
               a robe [or other item) in the prescribec
               way secured the maker admission to the
               Society of women who had done similar
               things.”11 A candidate would announce
               her intention to embellish a certain
               item, usually to bring protection to a
               child or warrior or to fulfill a sacred
               vow. If the Society approved, a crier
               announced the plan to the tribe.</p>
               <p>The woman prepared a feast for
               members of the Society. These individ-
               uals reviewed past creations—the de-
               signs and the circumstances—very
               much as warriors recounted their
               coups. After the feast an old woman
               was asked to make the design for the
               robe, which she drew on the skin with a
               stick and white clay.12 Throughout the
               long period of work to make the robe or
               other objects there were many strict ob-
               servances. If the woman made a
               mistake in sewing, a brave man who
               had counted many coups was called               
               upon. Reciting his experiences, he slip-
               ped his knife under the sinew to cut the
               thread. The completion of the object
               was announced by the crier of the Soci-
               ety and ceremonies followed.</p>

               <p>Cheyenne tradition respected the
               Quillworkers Society whose “origins
               were sacred, for their ritual and cere-
               monies came from the Man who mar-
               ried the Buffalo Wife. The traditions
               concerning the Buffalo Wife are, in
               turn, linked to the coming of the Sun
               Dance ceremonies from the Buffalo
               people themselves.13 Part of the
               strength and power that enabled the
               women to do the work emanated from-
               the sacred bundle associated with the
               Society." Their work was so important
               that a warrior could count coups on a
               completed work under certain condi-
               tions.</p>
               <p>Glass beads and woolen and cotton
               cloth became valued trade items for the
               Plains tribes. As early as 1595 Euro-
               peans were considering what color
               beads provided the best rate of ex
               change.15 Women adopted beads for
               traditional and innovated designs. By
               1850 cloth was replacing skins for use
               as robes or being combined with skin
               on various articles.16 Quilling was the
               preferred way to embellish highly religious objects, even after beadwork had
               become popular.</p>
               <p>Around the time the tribe was being
               relocated in Oklahoma (Indian Ter-
               ritory), many fine old pieces were trad-
               ed for horses, especially when one
               group, the Northern Cheyenne, started
               returning to its native lands. Traders,
               aware of how extraordinary these ob-
               jects were, had begun to obtain them in
               the mid-19th century and maybe earli-
               er. It is remarkable that any of the fra-
               gile quillwork survived the years of
               warfare and relocations during which
               the Cheyenne struggled for their very
               existence as a culture. Because of the
               reverence in which sacred quillwork
               was held, skins decorated with ceremo-
               nial symbols were handed down for
               centuries from one generation to
               another.1</p>
               <p>Today Cheyenne women make bead-
               work in the old way, but it is slow, as it
               has always been. No one doubts its val-
               ue or beauty, but the women say no one
               will pay for the labor necessary to make
               elaborate pieces with customary care.
               Despite the difficulty for Cheyenne
               women of obtaining materials and the
               necessity of their selling work for in-
               come, the Beadworkers Society still
               sponsors women’s honored work, con-
               tinuing traditional tribal values. Its ex-
               istence reflects the strength of Chey-
               enne women—particularly as a force
               for maintaining their culture in the rap-
               idly-changing world in which they now
               live.</p>
