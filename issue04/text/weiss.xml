                  <title>ALLLAIDE ALSOP ROBINEAU: 
                  Ceramist from Syracuse</title></head>
                  <byline>Peg Weiss</byline>
               <p>
               Adelaide Alsop Robineau (1865-
               1929) who worked and lived most of her
               life in Syracuse, New York, was one of
               the foremost ceramists of her time and
               is today regarded by many as America s
               greatest ceramist. She was a perfec-
               tionist: in 25 years of continued cre-
               ativity she produced only 600 works
               which she deemed worthy of survival.
               Nearly every known piece is a superior
               example of its type, whether it be the
               grand feu (high-fire) porcelain at which
               she excelled or stoneware; crystalline
               glaze or flammé; excised or pierced egg
               shell.</p>
               <p>Born in Middletown, Connecticut,
               the daughter of an engineer and invent-
               or, Adelaide Alsop was artistically tal-
               ented and determined to be self-
               supporting. She first turned to the dec-
               oration of porcelain, teaching herself
               the technique from books. She was
               soon proficient enough to become a
               teacher of porcelain painting, a career
               she pursued for several years at St.
               Mary s Hall school in Minnesota. In
               the early 1890s she returned to New
               York where she studied painting briefly
               with William Merritt Chase, still sup--
               porting herself as a china decorator.</p>
               <p>At 34, she married Samuel Robineau
               whom she had met in the Midwest.
               They joined G. H. Clark in Syracuse to
               found and publish Keramic Studio with
               Adelaide Robineau as editor. The new
               porcelain painters’ magazine soon dom-
               mated the field. A typical issue might
               include descriptions of new materials
               and techniques, an art historical article
               on Chinese porcelain painting and
               Robineau’s own designs and writings.
               Keramic Studio complemented another
               nationally known magazine published
               in the Syracuse area, The Craftsman.
               Edited by Gustave Stickley, creator of
               Mission furniture, it promoted the
               ideals of the international arts and
               crafts movement inherited from Wil-
               liam Morris. The magazines were ex-
               tremely influential to the development
               and flourishing of the American arts
               and crafts movement, achieving na-
               tional circulation in a short time.</p>
               <p>In 1903, Samuel Robineau translat-
               ed and published in Keramic Studio a
               series of articles by Taxile Doat, the
               Sevres master, on the making of grand
               feu porcelain. Adelaide Robineau had
               longed to create new forms and inspired
               by these articles she went to study with
               Charles Binns at the pottery school in
               Alfred, New York. She then set up her
               own kiln at home and fired her first
               batch of porcelains, with her husband
               serving as her advisor and technician.
               She experimented alone, however, with
               different clay bodies and developed a
               remarkable range of glazes, fixed and
               flowing, crystalline and matte, for
               which she is famous. She also ex-
               perimented endlessly to adjust Doat s
               formulas to her own materials and
               discovered a special variety of Texas
               kaolin that lent itself to her re-
               quirements of translucency and
               strength.</p>
               <p>In 1903-1904, the Robineaus built a
               house and separate studio on a hillside
               overlooking Syracuse which Adelaide
               designed with an architect friend,
               Catharine Budd. The studio building
               consisted of three stories: the kiln area
               on the first floor, the pottery on the se-
               cond and a playroom for the three
               Robineau children on the third. Having
               the children nearby while mother pur-
               sued her profession was considered
               drastically modern when the Rob-
               ineau home was featured in American
               Homes and Gardens in 1910. The
               buildings still stand on Robineau Road
               in Syracuse.</p>            
            <p>
               Adelaide Robineau’s brilliant experi-
               ments included the oxblood flammé of
               Chinese tradition, crystalline glazes in
               blue, white and maize, crackles and in-
               laid slip designs. She undertook a chal-
               lenge most of her contemporaries
               thought was impossible: the creation of
               eggshell coupes or shallow rimles
               bowls with excised designs. Because the
               paper-thin porcelain clay is so brittle, i
               can only be worked in the dry state
               and carving it requires extraordinary
               patience and delicacy. Of her 12 at-
               tempts at eggshell pieces, only three
               survived. The third, with a beautiful,
               excised design of swans, was broken
               in Detroit on its way to an exhibition.</p>
               <p>In 1910 Robineau was invited by Ed-
               ward G. Lewis, founder of the
               American Women’s League, to teach at
               University City Pottery at St. Louis,
               Missouri, and to work there with Tax-
               ile Doat. According to Paul Evans,
               “for a short time the University City
               Pottery had the most notable group of
               ceramic artists and experts thus far
               associated with an institution in this
               country. While there the Robineaus
               founded another magazine, Palette and
               Bench, under Lewis s sponsorship.</p>
               <p>It was also in St. Louis that Robin-
               eau created the magnificent “Scarab
               Vase which won a grand prize at the
               1910 Turin International Exposition. It
               required 1,000 hours of labor and two
               firings. Also called “The Apotheosis of
               the Toiler, the vase is decorated with
               an excised design of scarabs, a symbolic
               reference to the patience and skill
               demanded of the craftswoman. It is of
               translucent porcelain with an unglazed
               background and a relief design in a
               semi-opaque white glaze. Accents in
               pale blue-green are achieved with a
               thin, fixed, semi-opaque copper glaze.6</p>
               <p>In the “Poppy Vase of 1910, Robin-
               eau expressed a personal style that the
               influential New York critic, Royal Cor
               tissoz, later called a blending of
               precious qualities—of knowledge, skill,
               judgement, taste, and above all, the
               sense of beauty.”7 This vase, 6¼ inches
               high, is decorated with an exquisite
               poppy and leaf design which was first
               excised and then inlaid with colored</p>


            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_056.jpg" n="56" xml:id="img_0056"/>
            <p>
               slips. In the firing, the glazes remained
               perfectly set within the inlay, coloring
               and hardening to produce the effect of a
               transparent enamel over the whole.
               Small as it is, the vase has a monu-
               mental quality typical of Robineau s
               best work.</p>
               <p>Another masterpiece is the “Viking
               Ship Vase of 1905. With rich matte
               and semi-matte glazes of blue, green,
               brown and cream, the modest form is
               decorated with a typical Art Nouveau
               Viking ship motif, wave-tossed around
               its rim, a symbol of human trans-
               cendence over the vicissitudes of life. In
               a remarkable tour de force, the Viking
               ship motif is transformed from relief to
               sculpture in the delicately pierced, in-
               dependent stand which supports the
               vase.</p>
               <p>Vase after vase displays exquisite in-
               vention, from the subtle striations of
               the “Snake Bowl” with its delicate rep-
               tilian head, to the iridescent crystals of
               a small untitled white vase. Stylistical-
               ly, the work ranges from restrained and
               elegant adaptations of Art Nouveau or
               arts and crafts movement taste to the
               orientalizing manner of the eggshell
               coupes to Art Deco urns.</p>
              <p> Her work was so specialized and
               technically difficult that Robineau
               could not expect great moneta
               rewards. Whereas Louis Comfort Tif-
               fany in New York and Lalique in
               France employed many workers and
               turned out multiple versions of their
               patterns, Robineau’s creations were
               unique. Once in an attempt to increase
               her income, she tried to mass-produce
               porcelain doorknobs, but the endless
               repetition so frustrated and bored her
               that the operation ceased almost as
               soon as it began.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, she was richly reward-
               ed by professional recognition during
               her lifetime. Her work was introduced
               to the public at the 1904 St. Louis Ex-
               position and in 1905 Tiffany and Co.
               became an agent for the Robineau por-
               celains. She was selected to exhibit at
               the Musee des Arts Décoratifs and at
               the Paris Salon in 1911, was awarded
               Grand Prize at the 1915 San Francisco
               Exposition, and received special prizes
               and awards from the Art Institute of
               Chicago and the societies of arts and
               crafts in Detroit and Boston. She re-
               ceived an honorary Doctor of Ceramic
               Science degree from Syracuse Universi
               ty in 1917 and in 1920 she joined the
               faculty. The Metropolitan Museum
               mounted an unusual one-person me-
               morial exhibition of her work.</p>
               <p>According to Samuel Robineau’s ac-
               counting, she earned only about
               810,000 from the sale of her work. To-
               day it is considered priceless, a fact she
               anticipated in an hitherto unpublished
               letter:</p>
               <quote>In the days of the ancient Chinese pot-
               ters, Emperors paid fabulous prices for
               examples of their work, and nobility
               vied with each other to posess (sic) each
               piece which came perfect from the pot-
               ter s hands. All through the ages kings
               and wealth have been patrons and
               eager purchasers of art crafts, not only
               of former times but of contemporary ar-
               tists. It remained for grand America,
               who (sic) has been too busy just grow-
               ing, to neglect contemporary and native
               arts and crafts so that no country is so
               lacking in native craftsmen and crafts
               work. ... they the few patrons) have
               failed to see that contemporary talent
               has to be encouraged by purchase of the
               best in native work. [She expresses
               pleasure in Carter’s interest in adding
               her work to the museum’s collection
               and to encourage him and his board,
               she suggests the following) . . . as a
               simple matter of “boosting Syracuse
               such a collection might be a drawing
               card. When a city wishes to be called to
               sit up higher in the seats of honor, like a
               good business man she would put her
               best foot forward, if she has anything
               above the average, she writes it in large
               letters, if she has anything unique, she
               blazons it abroad—Syracuse has at
               least two unique boasts to make—there
               is the salt which gives its savor—And
               there are the Robineau Porcelains!</quote>
               <p>She then suggested a purchase plan
               involving her own donation of some
               works as an incentive to the board of
               the Syracuse Museum, and concluded:</p>
               <quote>In this way Syracuse will have such a
               collection as no other museum will ever
               have the opportunity of purchasing
               even for double the amount. And when
               the Syracuse Art Museum (sic) is
               quoted in future articles as having
               fine example of the work of this or that
               artist it will be added that Syracuse s
               unique glory is its collection of the por-
               celains of its townswoman the only
               individual maker of art porcelain in this
               country, one of the.few—the very few
               in the world and the only woman to at-
               tain such prominence in ceramics. All
               of which sounds very conceited from
               me but which is true neverthe-
               less. . .9</quote>
               <p>Clearly, Robineau was not one to be
               easily deterred. Her tenacity and con-
               fidence in her craft was further shown
               in an article she wrote for The Art
               World in 1917:</p>
               <quote>This fascinating work unfortunately is
               not a paying proposition, but it has
               given me the satisfaction of doing orig
               inal work, work which has not been
               done in this country before and may not
               be done again. . . . I often dream of all
               the things I would have done if I had
               begun earlier in life or if I had been fi-
               nancially independent so that 1 could
               have devoted myself entirely to my por-
               celains. The pieces I have produced are
               few in number, but they represent in
               design and shape the best that was in
               me and I hope that some of them may
               be an inspiration to some artist of the
               future, who perhaps will be able to do
               more and better work than 1 have
               done.10</quote>

               Adelaide Alsop Robineau need not
               have been so modest. Just as she pre-
               dicted, Syracuse does consider her
               work one of its glories. The Everson
               Museum still celebrates her memory in
               its regular Ceramics Exhibitions,
               inaugurated in her honor in 1932.
               Nearly half a century after her death
               she is admired by aspiring artists who
               covet the perfection of the “Poppy
               Vase or “The Viking Ship, or one of
               the unnamed but brilliant crystalline-
               glazed vases. She was a high-fire porce-
               lain maker, a “high-fire person and an
               artist of the highest caliber.</p>
               
              <p> 1. According to her husband’s recollection,
               All the unsatisfactory pieces were re-
               glazed and refired until they came out
               good or (were) entirely spoiled. (Sam-

               firing technician has been underscored
               by their daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth

               spondence courses and invited talented
