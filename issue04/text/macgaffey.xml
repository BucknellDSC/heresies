            <head><title>Kongo Pottery: Woman’s Art from Zaire </title></head>
               <byline>Janet MacGaffey</byline>
            
            <p>The superb work done by some
               African potters has been neglected as
               an art form and, since pottery is fragile
               and hard to transport, few examples of
               their work appear in museums. Potters
               among the Kongo people of Western
               Zaire in Central Africa are women and
               in the region in which I lived during the
               course of anthropological fieldwork.
               they make a matte black ware. Its pro-
               duction continues to flourish in the face
               of competition from factory-made pro-
               ducts, although on a smaller scale than
               in the past, because the potters have
               adapted the form and function of thei
               pots to changing social conditions.</p>
               <p>One of these potters is Mayivangwa
               Thérèse. Watching her making a pot
               one is struck by her absolute absorption
               and obvious satisfaction and enjoyment
               in perfecting its shape and decorating
               it. Sometimes she sings to herself as she
               smoothes a surface or incises a hatched
               band of decoration. Her meticulous
               care in achieving a perfectly shaped pot
               or delicately attached molded ornamen-
               tation is the mark of a perfectionist and
               her works are masterpieces of the pot-
               ter’s art.</p>
               <p>To reach her village, Mbanza Man-
               teke, 1 found a local truck carrying
               passengers and produce. The houses in
               Manteke are strung along the road and
               vary from cement block to adobe brick
               to wattle and daub. Arriving in the vil-
               lage on a hot afternoon I found Mayi-
               vangwa sitting on a mat behind her
               house making pots. She does not do this
               every day since potting is a part-time
               occupation that has to be fitted in with
               all the other things a Kongo woman
               does. Women produce and prepare all
               the food—sowing, cultivating and har-
               vesting the crops—as well as fetching
               water and firewood, and caring for their
               homes and children. When potting,
               Mayivangwa works for most of the day.
               making a number of pots in each of
               several styles, drying and storing them
               until she has a number suitable for
               firing.</p>
               <p>The village of Mbanza Manteke has
               a population of 582. It is the seat o
               local government for the district and
               has a school, dispensary and the offices
               of the mayor and police, but most of the
               villagers are subsistence farmers with
               little monev. The village is isolated
               from town life with its stores and busi-
               nesses, which is why Mayivangwa’s
               pots are still in demand in the village
               despite the influx into Zaire of ename
               ware, cheap crockery and aluminum
               pots and pans.</p>
               <p>Traditionally pots were made for
               purely utilitarian purposes; their decor-
               ation and artistic merit varied accord-
               ing to the talent and creativity of the
               potter. Big conical vessels for cooking
                  <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_120.jpg" n="120" xml:id="img_0120"/>
               were set over an open fire on three
               hearthstones; small bowls were used for
               eating and drinking; small water car-
               riers fit into a long, narrow, plaited
               palm-frond basket carried from the
               spring on a woman’s head; large jars
               two feet high were kept in houses to
               store and cool water.</p>
               <p>A Kongo woman has a budget separ
               ate from her husband’s; once she has
               fed her family she can do what she
               wants with the surplus produce of hei
               fields and keep the proceeds if she sells
               it. Likewise a potter keeps the money
               she earns from selling pots.</p>
               <p>Mayivangwa sells her pots for a
               small sum in the village: in 1965 the
               price was about 25 cents. Sometimes
               she takes some to Kinshasa where thej
               fetch about six dollars in the Ivor
               Market, a big market in the city center
               catering to tourists and the wealthy
               The reason for the higher price in the
               city is a change in the function of these
               pots: from being considered purely util
               itarian objects they are now in demand
               in the city as items of traditional art
               For some time Mayivangwa has been
               making a number of purely ornamenta
               pottery pieces, as well as the traditional
               utilitarian forms, to cater to this new
               art market. Some examples are shown
               here: two elephants, a water pot in the
               form of a chicken and a duck. They re-
               flect the influence of European orna-
               mental china animals that Mayivangwa
               has seen in stores or that have been
               brought home to the village by sailors.
               but she has created her own African-
               ized version, decorated with molded
               snakes and lizards. These creatures
               also appear on her water pots. Their
               significance is that they are considered
               by the Kongo to be mediators betweer
               this world and the other world of the
               dead: in Kongo cosmology water and
               amphibians are believed to mediate be-
               tween the two worlds.</p>
               <p>At the National Fair in Kinshasa in
               1970 some of Mayivangwa’s pitchers
               and ornamental pieces were exhibited.
               She had previously won prizes at sim-
               ilar events. Hers were the only pots
               from Lower Zaire in the exhibit; potters
               of her ability are rare in this area.
               Generally potters pass on their skills
               to a relative. Mayivangwa is teaching
               her sister who lives in Kinshasa. Thes-
               Kongo women are adapting to industri
               alization and urbanization by main-
               taining traditional forms appropriate to
               life today and responding creatively to
               changing needs.</p>
