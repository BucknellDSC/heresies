               "ART HYSTERICAL NOTIONS"
               OF TROORESSANDCULIURE
               Valerie Jaudon and Joyce Kozloff</p>
            <p>
               ZIs feminists and artists exploring the decorative in our own paintings, we were curious about the pe-
               jorative use of the word “decorative” in the contemporary art world. In rereading the basic texts of
               Modern Art, we came to realize that the prejudice against the decorative has a long history and is based on
               hierarchies: fine art above decorative art, Western art above non-Western art, men’s art above women’
               art. By focusing on these hierarchies we discovered a disturbing belief system based on the moral super
               iority of the art of Western civilization.
               We decided to write a piece about how language has been used to communicate this moral superiority
               Certain words have been handed down unexamined from one generation to the next. We needed to take
               these words away from the art context to examine and decode them. They have colored our own history
               our art training. We have had to rethink the underlying assumptions of our education.
               Within the discipline of art history, the following words are continuously used to characterize what has
               been called “high art”: man, mankind, the individual man, individuality, humans, humanity, the human
               figure, humanism, civilization, culture, the Greeks, the Romans, the English, Christianity, spirituality,
               transcendence, religion, nature, true form, science, logic, purity, evolution, revolution, progress, truth,
               freedom, creativity, action, war, virility, violence, brutality, dynamism, power and greatness.
               In the same texts other words are used repeatedly in connection with so-called “low art”: Africans,
               Orientals, Persians, Slovaks, peasants, the lower classes, women, children, savages, pagans, sensuality,
               pleasure, decadence, chaos, anarchy, impotence, exotica, eroticism, artifice, tattoos, cosmetics, ornament,
               decoration, carpets, weaving, patterns, domesticity, wallpaper, fabrics and furniture.
               All of these words appear in the quotations found throughout this piece. The quotations are from the
               writings and statements of artists, art critics and art historians. We do not pretend to neutrality and do not
               supply the historical context for the quotations. These can be found in the existing histories of Modern Art.
               Our analysis is based on a personal, contemporary perspective.</p>

               WAR AND VIRILITY
               Manifestoes of Modern Art often ex-
               hort artists to make violent, brutal
               work, and it is no accident that men
               such as Hirsh, Rivera, and Picasso like
               to think of their art as a metaphorical
               weapon. One of the longstanding tar
               gets of this weapon has been the decor
               ative. The scorn for decoration epito-
               mizes the machismo expressed by Le
               Corbusier, Gabol Pevsner and Marin-
               etti/Sant’Elia. Their belligerence may
               take the form of an appeal to the ma
               chine aesthetic: the machine is idolized
               as a tool and symbol of progress, anc
               technological progress is equated with
               reductivist, streamlined art. The in
               stinct to purify exalts an order which is
               never described and condemns a chaos
               which is never explained.</p>

               El Lissitsky, “Ideological super-
               structure, 1929:
               “Destruction of the traditional...

               called for.
               “Manifesto of the Futurist Paint-
               ers, 1910:
               “The dead shall be buried in the

               PURITY
               In the polemics of Modern Art, pur-
               ity represents the highest good. The
               more the elements of the work of art are
               pared down, reduced, the more visible
               the purity. Here Greenberg equates
               reductivism with rationality and func-
               tion. But it is never explained why or
               for whom art has to be functional, nor
               why reductivism is rational. Among
               artists as diverse as Sullivan, Ozenfant
               and de Kooning, we found the sexual
               metaphor of “stripping down art and
               architecture to make them nude or
               pure. The assumption is that the art-
               ist is male, and the work of art (object)
               female.

               Clement Greenberg, “Detached Ob-
               servations, 1976:
               “The ultimate use of art is construed
               as being to provide the experience of
               aesthetic value, therefore art is to be
               stripped down towards this end.
               Hence, modernist functionalism,
               essentialism’ it could be called, the
               urge to purify’ the medium, any
               medium. Purity’ being construed as
               the most efficacious, efficient,
               economical employment of the me-
               dium for purposes of aesthetic
               value.
               Louis Sullivan, “Ornament in Archi-
               tecture, 1892:
               it would be greatly for our aes-
               thetic good, if we should refrain
               from the use of ornament for a per-
               iod of years, in order that our
               thought might concentrate acutely
               upon the production of buildings
               well formed and comely in the
               nude.</p>
            <p>
               Amédée Ozenfant, Foundation
               Modern Art, 1931:
               “Decoration can be revolting, but a
               naked body moves us by the har-
               mony of its form.
               Willem de Kooning, “What Abstract
               Art Means to Me, 1951:
               “One of the most striking of abstract
               art’s appearance is her nakedness,
               an art stripped bare.</p>
            <p>
               PURITY IN ARTASA
               HOLY CAUSE
               Purity can also be sanctified as an aes-
               thetic principle. Modern artists and
               their espousers sometimes sound like
               the new crusaders, declaring eternal or
               religious values. A favorite theme is
               that of cleansing art. The ecclesiastical
               metaphor of transcendence through
               purification (baptism) is used to uphold
               the “Greek tradition (as in the van de
               Velde quotation) or the “Christian
               tradition (as in the Loos quotation).
               Cleansing and purification are some-
               times paired with an exalted view of the
               artistas a god, as in Apollinaire s' desire
               to “deify personality.

               Painters, 1913:

               THE SUPERIORITY OF
               WESTERN ART
               Throughout the literature of Western
               art there are racist assumptions that de-
               value the arts of other cultures. The an-
               cient Greeks are upheld as the model,
               an Aryan ideal of order. Art in the
               Greco-Roman tradition is believed to
               represent superior values. Malraux
               uses the word “barbarian and Fry the
               word savages to describe art and art
               ists outside our tradition. The non-
               Western ideals of pleasure, meditation
               and loss of self are clearly not under-
               stood by the exponents of ego assertion,
               transcendence and dynamism.

               David Hume, “Of National Charac-
               ters (on Africans), 1748:
               “There scarcely ever was a civilized
               nation of that complexion nor even
               any individual, eminent either in ac-
               tion or speculation. No ingenious
               manufactures amongst them, no
               arts, no ściences.
               Roger Fry, “The Art of the Bush-
               men, 1910:
               “. . . it is to be noted that all the peo-
               ples whose drawing shows this pe-
               culiar power of visualization (sen-
               sual not conceptual) belong to what
               we call the lowest of savages, they
               are certainly the least civilizable,
               and the South African Bushmen are
               regarded by other native races in
               much the same way that we look
               upon negroes.
               André Malraux, The Voices of Si-
               lence, 1953:
               “Now a barbarian art can keep alive
               only in the environment of the bar
               barism it expresses . .
               “. .. the Byzantine style, as the West
               saw it, was not the expression of a
               supreme value but merely a form of
               decoration.
               Roger Fry, “The Munich Exhibition
               of Mohammedan Art, 1910:
               “It cannot be denied that in course
               of time it [Islamic art) pandered to
               the besetting sin of the oriental
               craftsman, his intolerable patience
               and thoughtless industry.
               Gustave von Grunebaum, Medieval
               Islam, 1945:
               Islam can hardly be called creative
               in the sense that the Greeks were
               creative in the fifth and fourth cen-
               turies B.C. or the Western world
               since the Renaissance, but its flavor
               is unmistakable . . .</p>

               FEAR OF RACIAL
               CONTAMINATION,
               IMPOTENCE AND
               DECADENCE
               Racism is the other side of the coin of
               Exotica. Often underlying a fascination
               with the Orient, Indians, Africans and
               primitives is an urgent unspoken fear of
               infiltration, decadence and domination
               by the mongrels gathering impatient-
               ly at the gates of civilization. Ornamen-
               tal objects from other cultures which
               appeared in Europe in the nineteenth
               century were clearly superior to West-
               ern machine-made products. How
               could the West maintain its notion of
               racial supremacy in the face of these
               objects? Loos’s answer: by declaring
               that ornament itself was savage. Artists
               and aesthetes who would succumb to
               decorative impulses were considered
               impotent and/or decadent.

               Adolf Loos, “Ornament and Crime,
               1908:
               “I have made the following discov-
               ery and I pass it on to the world: The
               evolution of culture is synonymous
               with the removal of ornament from
               utilitarian objects. I believed that
               with this discovery I was bringing
               joy to the world; it has not thanked
               me. People were sad and hung their</p>
            <p>
               heads. What depressed them was the
               realization that they could produce
               no new ornaments. Are we alone, the
               people of the nineteenth century,
               supposed to be unable to do what
               any Negro, all the races and periods
               before us have been able to do?
               What mankind created without or-
               nament in earlier millenia was
               thrown away without a thought and
               abandoned to destruction. We pos-
               sess no joiner’s benches from the
               Carolingian era, but every trifle that
               displays the least ornament has been
               collected and cleaned and palatial
               buildings have been erected to house
               it. Then people walked sadly about
               between the glass cases and felt
               ashamed of their impotence.
               Amédée Ozenfant, Foundations of
               Modern Art, 1931:
               Let us beware lest the earnest effort
               of younger peoples relegates us to
               the necropolis of the effete nations,
               as mighty Rome did to the dilet
               tantes of the Greek decadence, or
               the Gauls to worn-out Rome.
               “Given many lions and few fleas, the
               lions are in no danger; but when the
               fleas multiply, how pitiful is the
               lions' lot!
               Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger,
               Cubism, 1912:
               As all preoccupation in art arises
               from the material employed, we
               ought to regard the decorative pre-
               occupation, if we find it in a painter,
               as an anachronistic artifice, useful
               only to conceal impotence.
               Maurice Barrés (on the Italian pre-
               Renaissance painters), 1897 (quoted
               in André Malraux, The Voices of Si-
               lence):
               And 1 can also see why aesthetes,
               enamored of the archaic, who have
               deliberately emasculated their virile
               emotions in quest of a more fragile
               grace, relish the poverty and petti-
               ness of these minor artists.</p>
            <p>
               RACISM AND SEXISM
               Racist and sexist attitudes characterize
               the same mentality. They sometimes
               appear in the same passage and are
               unconsciously paired, as when Read
               equates tattoos and cosmetics. The tat
               too refers to strange, threatening cus-
               toms of far-off places and mysterious
               people. Cosmetics, a form of self-orna-
               mentation, is equated with self-objecti-
               fication and inferiority (Schapiro). Ra-
               cism and sexism ward off the potential
               power and vitality of the other.
               Whereas nudity earlier alluded to wom-
               an as the object of male desire, here
               Malevich associates the nude female
               with savagery.</p>

               Herbert Read, Art and Industry,
               1953:
               “All ornament should be treated as
               suspect. I feel that a really civilized
               person would as soon tattoo his body
               as cover the form of a good work of
               art with meaningless ornament. Le-
               gitimate ornament I conceive as
               something like mascara and lipstick
               —something applied with discretion
               to make more precise the outlines of
               an atready existing beauty.
               Adolf Loos, “Ornament and Crime,
               1908:
               “The child is amoral. To our eyes,
               the Papuan is too. The Papuan kills
               his enemies and eats them. He is not
               a criminal. But when modern man
               kills someone and eats him he is
               either a criminal or a degenerate.
               The Papuan tattoos his skin, his
               boat, his paddles, in short every-
               thing he can lay hands on. He is not
               a criminal. The modern man who
               tattoos himself is either a criminal
               or a degenerate. There are prisons
               in which eighty percent of the in-
               mates show tattoos. The tattooed
               who are not in prison are latent
               criminals or degenerate aristocrats.
               If someone who is tattooed dies at
               liberty, it means he has died a few
               years before committing a murder.
               Meyer Schapiro, “The Social Bases

               HIERARCHY OF HIGH-
               LOW ART
               Since the art experts consider the “high
               arts of Western men superior to all
               other forms of art, those arts done by
               non-Western people, low-class people
               and women are categorized as minor
               arts, primitive arts,” “low arts, etc.
               A newer more subtle way for artists to
               elevate themselves to an elite position is
               to identify their work with pure sci-
               ence, pure mathematics, linguistics
               and philosophy. The myth that high art
               is for a select few perpetuates the hier-
               archy in the arts, and among people as
               well.

               It will be objected that such art for
               the masses as folk art was developed
               under rudimentary conditions of
               production—and that a good deal of
               folk art is on a high level. Yes, it is—
               but folk art is not Athene, and it's
               Athene whom we want: formal cul-
               ture with its infinity of aspects, its

               There is a hierarchy in the arts: de-
               corative art at the bottom, and the
               human form at the top.
               Because we are men.
               Andre Malraux, The Voices of Si-
               lence, 1953:
               “The design of the carpet is wholly
               abstract; not so its color. Perhaps we
               shall soon discover that the sole rea-
               son why we call this art decorative
               is that for us it has no history, no
               hierarchy, no meaning. Color repro-
               duction may well lead us to review
               our ideas on this subject and rescue

               “In the same sense that science is for
               scientists and philosophy is for phil-
               osophers, art is for artists.
               Joseph Kosuth, “Introductory Note
               by the American Editor, 1970:
               “In a sense, then, art has become as

               THAT OLD CHESTNUT.
               "HUMANISN
               Humanism was once a radical doctrine
               opposing the authority of the church,
               but in our secular society it has come to
               defend the traditional idea of man-
               kind” and status quo attitudes. The
               human values such authorities de-
               mand of art depend on the use of par-
               ticular subject matter or particular
               ideas of “human expression. Without
               humanist content, ornament, pattern
               and ritual or decorative elaborations of
               production are condemned as inhu-
               man, alien and empty. “The limits of
               the decorative, says Malraux, can be

               the generalities of “humanist” senti-
               ment characterize only a small part of
               world art, most of which is non-West-

               anyone prefer the false divisions of
               these writers, based on ethnic stereo-
               types, to a historical awareness of the

               l’art décoratif en France (on the
               Impressionists), 1896:
               Decorative art has as its aesthetic
               and for its effect not to make one
               think of man, but of an order of
               things arranged by him: it is a de-
               scriptive and deforming art, a
               grouping of spectacles the essence
               of which is to be seen.
               Rudolf Arnheim, Art and Visual
               Perception, 1954:
               “Paintings or sculpture are self-con-
               tained statements about the nature
               of human existence in all its essen-
               tial aspects. An ornament presented
               as a work of art becomes a fool’s par-
               adise, in which tragedy and discord
               are ignored and an easy peace
               reigns.
               Hilton Kramer, “The Splendors and
               hill of Islamic Art, 1975:
               .. . for those of us who seek in art

               the expectations of Western sensi-
               bility.
               “Perhaps with the passage of time,
               Istamic art will come to look less
               alien to us than it does today. I
               frankly doubt it—there are too many
               fundamental differences of spirit to

               DECORATION AND
               DOMESTICITY
               The antithesis of the violence and des-
               truction idolized by Modern Art is the
               visual enhancement of the domestic en-
               vironment. (If humanism is equated
               with dynamism, the decorative is seen
               to be synonymous with the static). One
               method “modernism has used to dis-
               credit its opponents has been to associ-
               ate their work with carpets and wall-
               paper. Lacking engagement with
               human form or the real world,” the
               work of art must be stigmatized as dec-
               orative (Sedlmayr and Barnes/de Maz-
               ia). So decorative art is a code term sig-
               nifying failed humanism. Artists such
               as Gleizes and Kandinsky, anxious to
               escape the tag of the decorative, con-
               nect their work to older, humanist
               aspirations.
               
               Aldous Huxley on Pollock’s Cathe-
               dral, 1947:
               'It seems like a panel for a wall-
               paper which is repeated indefinitely
               around the wall.

               one step nearer [to fine art) than a

               Hans Sedlmayr, Art in Crisis: The
               Lost Center, 1948:
               With Matisse, the human form was
               to have no more significance than a
               pattern on a wallpaper . . .
               Dr. Albert C. Barnes and Violette de
               Mazia, The Art of Cezanne, 1939:
               Pattern, in Cézanne an instrument
               strictly subordinated to the expres-
               sion of values inherent in the real
               world, becomes in cubism the entire
               aesthetic content, and this degrada-
               tion of form leaves cubistic painting
               with no claim to any status higher
               than decoration.</p>

               Albert Gleizes, “Opinion” (on Cub-
               ism), 1913:

               cient by which we may verify the le-
               gitimacy of our discoveries, avoid
               reducing the picture merely to the
               ornamental value of an arabesque or
               an Oriental carpet, and obtain an in-
               finite variety which would otherwise
               be impossible.
               Wassily Kandinsky, Über das Geis-
               tige in der Kunst, 1912:
               “If we begin at once to break the
               bonds that bind us to nature and to
               devote ourselves purely to combina-
               tions of pure color and independent
               form, we shall produce works which
               are mere geometric decoration, re-
               sembling something like a necktie
               or a carpet.</p>

               AUTOCRACY
               Certain modern artists express the de-
               sire for unlimited personal power. The
               aesthetics of modernism —its ego-
               mania, violence, purity-fixation and
               denial of all other routes to the truth—is
               highly authoritarian. The reductivist
               ideology suggests an inevitable,
               evolutionary survival of the (aesthetic)
               fittest. Reinhardt declares throughout
               his writings that all the world’s art must
               culminate in his pure paintings. Oz-
               enfant equates purism with a super-
               state. Mendelsohn believes the advo-
               cates of the new art have a right to
               exercise control.

               Ad Reinhardt, “There is Just One
               Painting, 1966:
               “There is just one art history, one
               art evolution, one art progress.
               There is just one aesthetics, just one
               art idea, one art meaning, just one
               principle, one force. There is just
               one truth in art, one form, one
               change, one secrecy.
               Amédée Ozenfant, Foundations of
               Modern Art, 1931:
               “Purism is not an aesthetic, but a
               sort of super-aesthetic in the same
               way that the League of Nations is a
               superstate.
               Erich Mendelsohn, “The Problem
               of aNew Architecture, 1919:
               “The simultaneous process of revo-

               radical changes in human relation-

               tude—the prejudice against the decora-
               tive in art—and found ourselves in a
               labyrinth of myth and mystification.
               By taking these quotes out of context
               we are not trying to hold these artists
               and writers up to ridicule. However, to
               continue reading them in an unques-
               tioning spirit perpetuates their biases.
               The language of their statements is of-
               ten dated—indeed, some of them are
               over a century old—but the sentiments
               they express still guide contemporary
               theory in art.
               Modernism, the theory of Modern
               Art, claimed to break with Renaissance
               humanism. Yet both doctrines glorify
               the individual genius as the bearer of
               creativity. It seems worth noting thai
               such heroic genius has always appeared
               in the form of a white Western male
               We, as artists, cannot solve these prob-
               lems, but by speaking plainly we hope
               to reveal the inconsistencies in assump-
