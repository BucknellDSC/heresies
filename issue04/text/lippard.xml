               Making Something from Nothing
               (Toward a Definition of Women’s “Hobby Art”)</head>
               <byline>Lucy R. Lippard</byline>
            <p>
               In 1968 Rubye Mae Griffith and
               Frank B. Griffith published a “hobby
               book called How To Make Something
               from Nothing. On the cover (where it
               would sell books) his name was listed
               before hers, while on the title page
               (where it could do no harm), hers ap-
               peared before his. It is tempting to
               think that it was she who wrote the
               crypto-feminist dedication: “To the
               nothings—with the courage to turn into
               somethings.” The book itself is con-
               cerned with transformation—of tin
               cans, beef knuckle bones, old razor
               blades, breadbaskets and bottlecaps in-
               to more and less useful and decorative
               items. As “A Word in Parting,” the
               authors state their modest credo: “This
               book . . . is simply a collection of ideas
               intended to encourage your ideas ..
               We want you to do things your way...
               Making nothings into somethings is a
               highly inventive sport but because it is
               inventive and spontaneous and origina.
               it releases tensions, unties knots of
               frustration, gives you a wonderful sense
               of pleasure and accomplishment. So ex
               periment, dare, improvise—enjoy every
               minute—and maybe you’Il discover, as
               we did, that once you start making
               something from nothing, you find you
               can’t stop, and what’s more you don’t
               want to stop!</p>
            
               <p>Despite the tone and the emphasis on
               enjoyment—unpopular in serious cir-
               cles—this “sport” sounds very much
               like fine or “high” art. Why then are its
               products not art? “Lack of quality
               will be the first answer offered, and
               “derivative” the second, even though
               both would equally apply to most of the
               more sophisticated works seen in galler-
               ies and museums. If art is popularly
               defined as a unique and provocative
               object of beauty and imagination, the
               work of many of the best contemporary
               “fine” artists must be disqualified
               along with that of many “craftspeo-
               ple,” and in the eyes of the broad audience, many of the talented hobbyist’s
               works would qualify. Yet many of these.
               in turn, would not even be called
               “crafts” by the purists in that field. Al-
               though it is true that all this name call-
               ing is a red herring, it makes me
               wonder whether high art by another
               name might be less intimidating and
               more appealing. On the other hand
               would high art by any other name look
               so impressive, be so respected and so
               commercially valued? I won’t try to
               answer these weighted queries here, but
               simply offer them as other ways of
               thinking about some of the less obvious
               aspects of the art of making.</p>
              <p> Much has been made of the need to
               erase false distinctions between art and
               craft, “fine” art and the “minor” arts.
               high” art and “low” art—distinctions
               that particularly affect women’s art.
               But there are also “high” crafts and
               “low” ones, and although women wield
               more power in the crafts world than in
               the fine art world, the same problems
               plague both. The crafts need only on
               more step up the aesthetic and financi
               respectability ladder and they will
               headed for the craft museums rathe
               than for people’s homes.</p>
               <p>Perhaps until the character of the
               museums changes, anything ending up
               in one will remain a display of upper
               class taste in expensive and doubtfully
               “useful” objects. For most of this cen-
               tury, the prevailing relationship be
               tween art and “the masses” has been
               one of paternalistic noblesse oblige
               along the lines of “we who are educated
               to know what’s correct must pass our
               knowledge and good taste down to
               those who haven’t the taste, the time,
               or the money to know what is Good.
               Artists and craftspeople, from William
               Morris to de Stijl and the Russian Con-
               structivists, have dreamed of socialist
               Utopias where everyone’s life is im
               proved by cheap and beautiful objects
               and environments. Yet the path of the
               Museum of Modern Art’s design de-
               partment, also paved with good inten-
               tions, indicates the destination of such
               dreams in a capitalist consumer society.
               A pioneer in bringing to the public the
               best available in commercial design
               the Museum’s admirable display of
               such ready-mades as a handsome and
               durable 39c paring knife or a 69c coffee
               mug has mostly given way to installa
               tions more typical of Bonnier’s, DR, or
               some chic Italian furniture showroom.</p>
               <p>It is, as it so often is, a question of
               audience, as well as a question of cate-
               gorization. (One always follows the
               other.) Who sees these objects at
               MOMA? Mostly people who buy 83.00
               paring knives and 88.00 coffee muge
               which are often merely “elevated” ex-
               amples of the cheaper versions, with
               unnecessary refinements or simplifica
               tions. Good Taste is once again an eco-
               nomic captive of the classes who rule
               the culture and govern its institutions.
               Bad Taste is preferred by those ingrates</p>
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_066.jpg" n="66" xml:id="img_0066"/>

               who are uneducated enough to ignore
               or independent enough to reject the im-
               positions from above. Their lack of
               enthusiasm provides an excuse for the
               aesthetic philanthropists, their hands
               bitten, to stop feeding the masses.
               Class-determined good/bad taste pat-
               terns revert to type.</p>
               <p>Such is the process by which both
               design objects and the “high crafts
               have become precisely the consumer
               commodity that the rare socially con-
               scious “fine artist is struggling to
               avoid. Historically, craftspeople, whose
               work still exists on a less exalted equi-
               librium between function and com-
               merce, have been most aware of the
               contradictions inherent in the distinc-
               tion between art and crafts. The dis-
               tinction between design and “high
               crafts is a modern one. Both have their
               origins in the “low crafts of earlier
               periods, sometimes elevated to the level
               of “folk art” because of their usefulness
               as sources for “fine art. A “designer
               is simply the craftsperson of the techno-
               logical age, no longer forced to do her-
               his own making. The Bauhaus became
               the cradle of industrial design, but the
               tapestries, furniture, textiles and tea
               sets made there were still primarily
               works of art. Today, the most popular
               housewares all through the taste gamut
               of the American lower-middle to upper-
               middle class owe as much stylistically
               to the “primitive or “low crafts—
               Mexican, Asian, American Colonial—
               as to the streamlining of the interna-
               tional style. In fact, popular design
               tends to combine the two, which meet
               at a point of (often spurious) simplic-
               ity, and to become “kitsch —diluted
               examples of the Good Taste that is hid-
               den away in museums, expensive
               stores, and the homes of the wealthy,
               mnaccessible to everyone else.</p>
               <p>The hobby books reflect the manner
               in which Good Taste is still unarguably
               set forth by the class system. Different
               books are clearly aimed at different
               tastes, aspirations, educational levels.
               For instance, Dot Aldrich’s Creating
               with Cattails, Cones and Pods is not
               aimed at the inner city working-class
               housewife or welfare mother (who
               couldn’t afford the time or the mater
               ials) or at the farmer’s wife (who sees
               enough weeds in her daily work) but at
               the suburban upper middle-class wom-
               an who thinks in terms of “creating,
               has time on her hands and access to the
               materials. Aldrich is described on the
               dust jacket as a garden club member, a
               naturalist, and an artist; the book is il-
               lustrated by her daughter. She very
               thoroughly details the construction of
               dollhouse furniture, corsages and
               arrangements” from dried plants and
               an occasional orange peel. Her taste is
               firmly placed as good” within her
               class, although it might be seen as
               gauche “homemade art” by the upper
               class and ugly and undecorative by the
               working class.</p>
               <p>Hazel Pearson Williams Feather
               Flowers and Arrangements, on the
               other hand, has the sleazy look of a
               mail-order catalogue; it is one of a craft
               course series and its fans, birdcages,
               butterflies and candles are all made
               from garishly colored, rather than na-
               tural materials. The book is clearly
               aimed at a totally different audience,
               one that is presumed to respond to such

               <p>The objects illustrated in books like
               the Griffiths are neither high art nor
               high craft nor design. Yet such books
               are myriad, and they are clearly aimed
               at women—the natural bricoleurs, as
               Deena Metzger has pointed out. The
               books are usually written by a woman.
               and if a man is co-author he always
               seems to be a husband, which adds a
               certain familial coziness and gives him
               an excuse for being involved in such
               blatantly female fripperies (as well as
               dignifying the frippery by his participa-
               tion). Necessity is the mother, not the
               father of invention. The home maker’s
               sense of care and touch focuses on sew-
               ing, cooking, interior decoration as
               often through conditioning as through
               necessity, providing a certain bond be-
               tween middle-class and working-class
               housewives and career women. (I am
               talking about the making of the home,
               not just the keeping of it; “good
               housekeeping” is not a prerogative for
               creativity in the home. It might even be
               the opposite, since the “houseproud’
               woman is often prouder of her house,
               her container, than she is of herself.)
               Even these days women still tend to be
               brought up with an exaggerated sense
               of detail and a need to be “busy, often
               engendered by isolation within a par-
               ticular space, and by the emphasis on
               cleaning and service. A visually sen-
               sitive woman who spends day after day
               in the same rooms develops a compul-
               sion to change, adorn, expand them, an
               impetus encouraged by the “hobby
               books.</p>
               <p>The overdecoration of the home
               and the fondness for bric-a-brac often
               attributed to female fussiness or plain
               Bad Taste can just as well be attributed
               to creative restlessness. Since most
               homemade hobby objects are geared to-
               ward home improvement, they inspire
               less fear in their makers of being self-
               ish or self-indulgent, there is no
               confusion about pretentions to Art, and
               the woman is freed to make anything
               she can imagine. (At the same time it is
               true that the imagination is often stimu-
               lated by exposure to other such work,
               just as real” artists are similarly de-
               pendent on the art world and the works
               of their colleagues.) Making conversa-
               tion pieces” like deer antler salad tongs
               or a madonna in an abalone shell grot-
               to, or a mailbox from an old breadbox,
               or vice versa, can be a prelude to break
               ing with the “functional” excuse and
               the making of wholly “useless objects.</p>
               <p>Now that the homebound woman
               has a little more leisure, thanks to so-
               called labor-saving devices, her pas-
               times are more likely to be cultural in
               character. The less privileged she is,
               the more likely she is to keep her inter-
               ests inside the home with the focus of
               her art remaining the same as that of
               her work. The better off and better
               educated she is, the more likely she is to
               go outside of the home for influence or
               stimulus, to spend her time reading, go-
               ing to concerts, theatre, dance, staying
               well informed. If she is upwardly
               mobile, venturing from her own con-
               firmed tastes into foreign realms where
               she must be cautious about opinions
               and actions, her insecurity is likely to
               lead to the classic docility of the mid-
               dle-class audience, so receptive to what
               experts” tell them to think about the
               arts. The term culture vulture is un-
               derstood to apply mainly to upwardly
               mobile women. And culture, in the
               evangelical spirit of the work ethic, is
               often also inseparable from good
               works.</p>

               Middle- and upper-class women, al-
               ways stronger in their support of “cul-
               ture than any other group, seem to
               need aesthetic experience in the broad-

               world, for which educated women, at
               least to some extent, have been pre-
               pared, has been denied them, and
               because they have the time and the
               background to think—but not the
               means to act. Despite the fact that mid-
               dle-class women have frequently been
               strong (and anonymous) forces for
               social justice, the earnestness and
               amateur status of such activities have
               been consistently ridiculed, from the
               Marx Brothers’ films to the cartoons of
               Helen Hokinson.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, the League of Women
               Voters, the volunteer work for under-
               funded cultural organizations, the
               garden clubs, literary circles and
               discussion groups of the comfortable
               classes have been valid and sometimes
               courageous attempts to move out into
               the world while remaining sufficiently
               on the fringes of the system so as not to
               challenge its male core. The working-
               class counterparts are, for obvious
               reasons, aimed less at improving the lot
               of others than at improving one’s own,
               and, like hobby art, are more locally
               and domestically focused in unions,
               day care, paid rather than volunteer
               social work, Tupperware parties—and
               the PTA, where all classes meet. In any
               case, the housewife learns to take deri-
               sion in her stride whether she intends to
               be socially effective or merely wants to
               escape from the home now and then
               (families are jealous of time spent else-
               where).</p>
               <p>Women’s liberation has at least be-
               gun to erode the notion that woman’s
               role is that of the applauding spectator
               for men s creativity. Yet as makers of
               (rather than housekeepers for) art, they
               still trespass on male ground. No won-
               der, then, that all over the world, wom-

               daring enough to consider creation out-
               side traditional limits are finding an
               outlet for these drives in an art that is
               not considered “art, an art that there
               is some excuse for making, an art that
               costs little or nothing and performs an
               ostensibly useful function in the bar-
               gain—the art of making something out
               of nothing.</p>
               <p>If ones only known outlets are
               follow-the-number painting or the
               ready-made “kit art offered by the
               supermarket magazines, books like the
               Griffiths open up new territory. Sug-
               gestions in “ladies and handiwork
               magazines should not be undervalued
               either. After all, quilt patterns were
               published and passed along in the 19th
               century (just as fashionable art styles
               are in today s art world). The innova-
               tive quilt maker or group of makers
               would come up with a new idea that
               broke or enriched the rules, just as the
               Navajo rug maker might vary brilliant-
               ly within set patterns (and modern ab-
               stractionists innovate by sticking to the
               rules of innovation).</p>
               <p>The shared or published pattern forms
               the same kind of armature for painstak-
               ing handwork and for freedom of ex-
               pression within a framework as the
               underlying grid does in contemporary
               painting. Most modern women lack the
               skills, the motive and the discipline to
               do the kind of handwork their foremothers did by necessity, but the stitch-
               like mark” Harmony Hammond has
               noted in so much recent abstract art by
               women often emerges from a feminist
               adoption of the positive aspects of
               women’s history. It relates to the
               ancient, sensuously repetitive, Penelo-
               pean rhythms of seeding, hoeing, gath-
               ering, weaving, spinning, as well as to
               modern domestic routines.</p>
               <p>In addition, crocheting, needlework,
               embroidery, rug-hooking and quilting
               are coming back into middle- and
               upper-class fashion on the apron strings
               of feminism and fad. Ironically, these
               arts are now practiced by the well-off
               out of boredom and social presure as
               often as out of emotional necessity to
               make connections with women in the
               past. What was once work has now be-
               come art or “high craft—museum-
               worthy as well as commercially valid.
               In fact, when Navajo rugs and old
               quilts were first exhibited in New York
               fine arts museums in the early 1970s,
               they were eulogized as neutral, ungen
               dered sources for big bold geometri
               abstractions by male artists like Frank
               Stella and Kenneth Noland. Had they
               been presented as exhibitions of wom.
               en’s art, they would have been seen
               quite differently and probably would
               not have been seen at all in a fine an
               context at that time.</p>
               <p>When feminists pointed out tha
               these much-admired and strong
               works were in fact women’s crafts,
               one might have expected traditional
               women’s art to be taken more seriously,
               yet such borrowings from “below
               must still be validated from above.
               William C. Seitz’s Assemblage show
               at the Museum of Modern Art in 1961
               had acknowledged the generative role
               of popular objects for Cubism, Dada
               and Surrealism, and predicted Pop Art,
               but he never considered women s work
               as the classic bricolage. It took a man,
               Claes Oldenburg, to make fabric sculp-
               ture acceptable, though his wife, Patty
               did the actual sewing. Sometimes men
               even dabble in women’s spheres in the
               lowest of low arts—hobby art made
               from throwaways by amateurs at home.
               But when a man makes, say, a maca-
               roni figure or a hand-tooled Last Sup-
               per, it tends to raise the sphere rather
               than lower the man, and he is likely to
               be written up in the local newspaper.
               Women dabbling in men’s spheres, on
               the other hand, are still either inferior
               or just freakishly amazing.</p>
               <p>It is supposed to be men who are
               handy around the house, men who
               fix things while women make the
               home. This is a myth, of course, and a
               popular one. There are certainly as
               many women who do domestic repair.
               as men, but perhaps the myth was de-
               vised by women to force men to invest
               some energy, to touch and to care about
               some aspect of the home. The fact re-
               mains that when a woman comes to
               make something, it more often than not
               has a particular character—whether
               this originates from role-playing, the
               division of labor, or some deeper con-
               sciousness. The difference can often be
               defined as a kind of positive frag-
               mentation or as the collage aesthet-
               ic—the mixing and matching of frag-
               ments to provide a new whole. Thus the
               bootcleaner made of bottlecaps sug
               gested by one hobby book might also be
               a Surrealist object.</p>
               <p>But it is not. And this is not entirely a
               disadvantage. Not only does the ama-
               teur status of hobby art dispel the need
               for costly art lessons, but it subverts the
               intimidation process that takes place
               when the male domain of “high” art is
               approached. As it stands, women—and</p>
            <pb facs="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BucknellDSC/heresies/main/issue04/images/Heresies_04_068.jpg" n="68" xml:id="img_0068"/>
            <p>
               especially women—can make hobby art
               in a relaxed manner, isolated from the
               real” world of commerce and the pres-
               sures of professional aestheticism. Dur-
               ing the actual creative process, this is
               an advantage, but when the creative
               ego s attendant need for an audience
               emerges, the next step is not the galler-
               ies, but to become a cottage indus-
               try. The gifte shoppe, the county or
               crafts fair and outdoor art show circuit
               is open to women where the high art
               world is not, or was not until it was
               pried open to some extent by the femin-
               ist art movement. For this reason,
               many professional women artists in the
               past made both public art” (canvases
               and sculptures acceptable to galleries
               and museums, conforming to a combin-
               ation of the two current art world
               tastes) and private or closet art
               (made for personal reasons or “just
               for myself”—as if most art were not).
               With the advent of the new feminism,
               the private has either replaced or
               merged with the public in much wom-
               en’s art and the delicate, the intimate,
               the obsessive, even the cute and the
               fussy in certain guises have become
               more acceptable, especially in feminist
               art circles. A striking amount of the
               newly discovered closet art by ama-
               teur and professional women artists re-
               sembles the chotchkas so universally
               scorned as women’s playthings and
               especially despised in recent decades
               during the heyday of neo-Bauhaus
               functionalism. The objects illustrated
               in Feather Flowers and Arrangements
               bear marked resemblance to what is
               now called Women’s Art, including a
               certainly unconscious bias toward the
               forms that have been called female
               imagery.</p>
               <p>Today we are resurrecting our moth-
               ers', aunts and grandmothers activi-
               ties—not only in the well-publicized
               areas of quilts and textiles, but also in
               the more random and freer area of
               transformational rehabilitation. On an
               emotional as well as on a practical
               level, rehabilitation has always been
               women’s work. Patching, turning col-
               lars and cuffs, remaking old clothes,
               changing buttons, refinishing or re-
               covering old furniture are all the
               traditional private resorts of the eco-
               nomically deprived woman to give her
               family public dignity. This continues
               today, even though in affluent Western
               societies cheap clothes fall apart before
               they can be rehabilitated and inventive
               patching is more acceptable (to the
               point where expensive new clothes are
               made to look rehabilitated and thrift
               shops are combed by the well-off).
               Thus “making something from nothing” is a brilliant title for a hobby book,
               appealing as it does both to housewifely
               thrift and to the American spirit of free
               enterprise—a potential means of mak-
               ing a fast buck.</p>
               <p>Finally, certain questions arise in re
               gard to women’s recent “traditionally
               oriented” fine art. Are the sources
               direct—from quilts and county fair
               handiwork displays—or indirect—via
               Dada, Surrealism, West Coast funk, or
               from feminist art itself? Is the resem-
               blance of women’s art-world art to hob-
               by art a result of coincidence? Of influ-
               ence, conditioning, or some inherent
               female sensibility? Or is it simply
               another instance of camp, or fashion-
               able downward mobility? The problem
               extends from source to audience.</p>
              
               <p>Feminist artists have become far more
               conscious of women’s traditional arts
               than most artists, and feminist artists
               are also politically aware of the need to
               broaden their audience, or of the need
               to broaden the kind of social experience
               fine art reflects. Yet the means by which
               to fill these needs have barely been ex-
               plored. The greatest lack in the femin-
               ist art movement may be for contact
               and dialogue with those amateurs
               whose work sometimes appears to be
               imitated by the professionals. Judy
               Chicago and her co-workers on The
               Dinner Party and their collaboration
               with china painters and needleworkers,
               Miriam Schapiro’s handkerchief ex-
               changes and the credit given the women
               who embroider for her, the “Mother
               Art” group in Los Angeles which per-
               forms in laundromats and similar pub-
               lic/domestic situations, the British
               “Postal Art Event, and a few other ex-
               amples are exceptions rather than the
               rule. It seems all too likely that only in
               a feminist art world will there be a
               chance for the “fine arts, the minor
               arts, crafts, and hobby circuits to
               meet and to develop an art of making
               with a new and revitalized communica-
               tive function. It won’t happen if the
               feminist art world continues to be ab-
               sorbed by the patriarchal art world.</p>
               <p>And if it does happen, the next ques-
               tion will be to what extent can this work
               be reconciled with all the varying cri-
               teria that determine aesthetic quality
               in the different spheres, groups, and
               cultures? Visual consciousness raising,
               concerned as it is now with female im-
               agery and, increasingly, with female
               process, still has a long way to go before
               our visions are sufficiently cleared to
               see all the arts of making as equal pro-
               ducts of a creative impulse which is as
               socially determined as it is personally
               necessary; before the idea is no longer
               to make nothings into somethings, but
               to transform and give meaning to all
               things. In this utopian realm, Good
               Taste will not be standardized in
               museums, but will vary from place to
               place, from home to home.</p>
