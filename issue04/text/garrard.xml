                  <p>“Until now, no one has been serious and pas-
               sionate, and certainly no one has been argumen-
               tative, concerning attitudes toward women. (1969) Cynthia Gornick, “Women and Creativity</p></epigraph>

            <p>
               In what way has the discipline of art history been affected
               by feminism and women’s studies?</p>
               <p>On one level the answer is obvious. We all know a great
               deal more about women artists of the past than we did even
               five years ago, thanks to the efforts of a growing number of
               scholars who are devoting their research skills to this area.
               Yet for the most part, this new knowledge remains
               hermetically sealed in its own world, not touching and often
               not touched by traditional methods and assumptions of the
               discipline. Women artists are discussed in courses on women
               artists, are written about in feminist journals, are grouped in
               single-sex exhibitions, and if I sound churlish about these ac-
               tivities, which surely have their positive effects, it is only
               with apprehension that we will all—feminist historians, ar-
               tists and critics—remain trapped in a great cultural ghetto of
               our own devising if we do not now begin to force the issue of
               integration. It is indeed time to put women artists in the
               regular art history curriculum, and most important, in the
               standard survey textbooks, so they can be seen by the next
               generation of students as natural phenomena, and not exotio
               hothouse plants.</p>
               <p>But there are other questions for art history raised by
               feminism. How has thinking changed? Should it not have
               changed? A generation of scholars in the early twentieth cen
               tury were prompted by their response to the Expressionism
               of their own era to re-examine early sixteenth century Man-
               nerism, and to appraise it positively for the first time. New
               wine in old bottles, art historically speaking, is a fresh and
               more complete understanding of the monuments of the past
               made possible by the analogous, yet genuinely new thought
               of the present. But where are the Friedlaenders of feminism?
               Why, now that we see the distorted attitudes and behavior of
               men and women in the past with a clarity that Plato s
               cavedwellers would have envied, are we not re-examining the
               relationship between such artificial, stereotyped behavior
               patterns and the art produced by those who believed in
               them?</p>
               <p>We can, of course, press the Mannerist analogy far enough
               to see the danger of imposing modern consciousness on pre-
               modern cultures. The heavy emphasis upon Angst that ac-
               companies much analytic writing on Mannerism in the 1920s
               is a prime example of such projection. Similarly, we would
               be foolish to look for feminist statements in the work of
               lady” artists of the Renaissance who never questioned the
               social order of their day. Undoubtedly discoveries are yet to
               be made about particular works—a Judith Leyster here, an
               Artemisia Gentileschi there—in which the woman artist
               turns a traditional iconographic formula upside down to ex-
               press a distinguishably female point of view. But not even
               this is the terra incognita we should be charting if we expect
               art history to be influenced by our thinking.</p>
               <p>There are two ways of looking at the history of attitudes
               toward women in art. One—the only one thus far explored-
               is to compensate for the lack of scholarly attention to women
               artists’ achievements by writing as apologists. Gabrielle
               Munter was unjustly overshadowed by Kandinsky; Jeanne-
               Elisabeth Chaudet was sentimental, but so was Greuze, they
               all painted flowers and portraits because they didn’t have ac-
               cess to the nude model, and so on. All of this is perfectly true,
               but is a lament from the ghetto, and it will not get us out be-
               cause it is defensive. The other way is to approach the histor-
               ic fact of discrimination against women from the other end-
               what has this politics of exclusion meant for male art? After
               all, despite the numerical hegemony of male artists, theirs is
               ultimately an art produced by only one of two sexes, and far
               from being universal, it is rampant with the prejudices, van-
               ities, insecurities and fears that afflict mere men as well as
               mere women.</p>
               <p>We have been sensitized for nearly ten years now to the
               fact that the image of each sex in art, and of their interaction,
               has been overwhelmingly a male perception, and as such, a
               grab-bag of aspirations, fantasies and neuroses, individual
               and collective. But if one looks, for instance, through the
               past five years of the Art Bulletin, it is virtually impossible to
               see that this understanding has affected the way scholars
               look at their subjects. One of the very few exceptions, Norma</p>

            <p>
               Broude’s article in the March 1977 issue, which debunks the
               traditional view of Degas as misogynist, met with strong
               editorial resistance before it was accepted and was first
               dismissed as a “women’s lib tract.” Such irrational reaction
               to logical revisions of thought stimulated by feminism ulti-
               mately bespeaks a bunker mentality, a stubborn, last-ditch
               effort to keep women and attitudes about them outside art
               history. And this in the discipline that deals with the human
               experience in its visual, most immediate manifestation.
               Resistance by men to the idea of women’s equality has
               produced mixed results in men’s art. On the positive side, the
               sense of superiority is often the mainstay of an elitist perspec-
               tive that makes art of some sorts possible. One could serious-
               ly argue that the Greek’s superb confidence in himself as the
               measure of things was buoyed by his conviction that his wife
               was a far less perfect yardstick. The Parthenon is not just the
               triumphant result of that self-esteem, it does not even reflect-
               ed a glimmer of bad conscience. On the other hand, the no-
               tion that females, and by extension that which is feminine in
               art, are inherently inferior has contaminated art historical
               thinking in curious ways.</p>
               <p>Why is our art history, for example, full of virtuous rever-
               sals, in which a virile, heroic or austere style suddenly and
               dramatically replaces a feminine, lyrical or luxurious one-
               David over Fragonard, Caravaggio over Salviati, clean In-
               ternational Modern Gropius over wickedly ornamental Sulli-
               van or Tiffany? Does it never go the other way? Who ever
               heard of a drastic hedonistic reaction to unbridled stoicism?
               The ornamental and feminine in art are seen as a kind of
               creeping sickness that gradually weakens the fabric of ster
               resolve until the virile essence has been fatally co-opted and
               must forcefully reassert itself. Hercules cleaning the Augean
               stables is heroic, his submission to Omphale shameful, and
               when he must choose between virtue and pleasure, we al-
               ready know the contest is rigged. Yet in explaining all this, it
               is not enough to point to the Western philosophical bias to fa-
               vor the moral over the pleasurable; we must also account for
               the equally deep-rooted attitude that identifies male with
               purposeful and female with corruptive. This kind of thinking
               has infected value judgments in art history in subtle ways,
               one fears, but to choose an unsubtle instance, such "“femin-
               ine styles as Maniera or Rococo, and all the decorative arts,
               have had to be defended against the supposedly devastating
               charge of frivolity, as if art were not the one sphere of our
               lives in which play is serious.</p>
               <p>It is possible, though no one has done so, to view the art of
               early Mannerism as a reaction against not the style of the
               High Renaissance, but its high moral (read masculine) ideal-
               ism. A couple of years ago, 1 began to look at Rosso Rioren-
               tino’s Moses Defending the Daughters of Jethro in a new
               way—as a comic parody of such paragons of virility in action
               as Michelangelo s Battle Cartoon, which was its point of de-
               parture. I do not know if Rosso intended it as parody, but
               the painting works as a commentary on the obsessive Renais-
               sance adoration of the heroic male nude and the glory of bat-
               tle, with its mock-heroic, tough little boy defenders and its
               kewpie-doll heroine. It is hilarious. Yet it is only possible to
               see the painting in this way if you take the heretical position
               that male heroism does not have an absolute value, but in an
               extreme form is subject to ridicule. No woman can walk
               around Florence today without some slight impulse to laugh
               at the material evidence of such an unabashedly phallocen-
               tric culture. Though fewer statues filled the squares in his
               day, Rosso quite conceivably had the same impulse.</p>
               <p>Writers on early Mannerism, on the other hand, have not
               been able to postulate any conceivable reason for rejecting a
               heroic idealism other than a wish to explore its formalist po-
               tential. Friedlaender explains that Rosso’s painting “is not
               formulated in terms of psychic depth, but is built on a purely
               aesthetic basis of form, color, et cetera, et cetera. Sydney
               Freedberg predictably discusses the work largely in formalist
               terms, and for him, the picture has not one but two contents,
               with Rosso relegating mannered grace and subtly distilled
               sensuality . . . to the feminine and minor components of the
               picture, and exploiting the subject’s possibilities of violence
               instead.”2 By identifying the “subject” with the male actors
               only, Freedberg mimics the very male solipsist attitude that
               Rosso appears to ridicule. Most of all, it is strange that writ-
               ers responsive to the expressive shift from the calm serious-
               ness of Andrea del Sarto to the hyperintensity of Pontorme
               should draw a blank on Rosso’s expressive tone. Strange, un-
               til one reflects that neither formalist manipulation nor
               heightened emotional intensity challenge any underlying so-
               cial assumptions. Antiheroic parody, on the other hand, calls
               into question an entire set of values, revealing the Apollo-
               David-Hercules images that symbolize such values to be as
               extreme in one direction as fainting Victorian heroines are in
               another.</p>
               <p>We have before us the prospect of an art history that takes
               sexual attitudes into account as subjective values and value
               judgments, rather than as absolute articles of faith. These
               values can be examined and assessed as part of the content of
               a work of art, factors often just as relevant to our under-
               standing of it as other factors that we routinely take serious-
               ly—military history, theological doctrine or social mores.
               Also, we are now in a position to recognize and discredit
               scholarly writing in which sexual stereotypes are imposed on
               material to which they are irrelevant. To seize these oppor-
