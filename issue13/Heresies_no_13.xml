				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>We had worked on this issue for some time before we realized exactly how huge our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>task was, and how inevitably we would not have room for much of what we wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>include-even if we managed to find women to write it. We broadly defined ecology as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the relationship between the organism and its environment. Even focusing on the human
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>female didn’t narrow things down much, females being over half the human race and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>taking up a lot of space in the natural world. If ever there was an area in which the per

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>What can women do about the disastrous direction the world is takingl We looked
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>both ways-into the past, at the earth and the earth mother images, at the current state of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the ecology, at the future in all its dimness. We wanted to be active, to show that our pro
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>vince is both nature and culture. A few aspects we were determined to cover were: the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>necessity for a feminist theory to integrate social life, history and natural environments;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the art women are doing in and about nature (and encouragement for that art to deal
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>directly with issues), the equal importance of rural and urban ecologies; the contribu
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tion of women to our growing awareness of the needs, as well as the pleasures, of nature;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the relation of women to militarism and to militant struggles for liberation; the callous
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>exploitation for profit of Third World countries people and resources-to feed the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>greedy maw of monopoly capitalism; the dangerous emphasis of the Reagan administra
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tion on militarism, at the expense of social services and the environment.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>We had also hoped to deal in some new way with reproductive rights and to produce
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>an extensive consumer information section. Since these didn’t come together, we want
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to go on record as stressing the fact that woman&apos;s right to choose or refuse children and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>abortion is at the core of any progressive program. It affects population, poverty, psycho

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>&quot;scientific creationism&quot; threatens our children&apos;s education, along with other reactionary
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ideological controls on culture from the New Right. Our responsibilities in the con

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>The answer, of course, is organization. From article to article in this issue we heal
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>women of all races discovering that if you don&apos;t do something yourself, it doesn’t get
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>done-in the world as in the home. You never expect &quot;it&quot; to happen to you, but when it
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>does, it is a radicalizing experience. You are the others. It is happening to you often
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>before you even know about it, even before it happens directly to you. The responsibility
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>lies not only with those who would like to keep us powerless, but with ourselves. Com
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>munication and organization are at the heart of resistance. Art and culture are integra
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>elements in resistance. Understanding this alone can help Us stop Them from moving
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>mountains and changing the courses of nature.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Our cover is Mt. St. Helens because she is a connecting image—a hole into the interior
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and an opening out of that center-both nurturing and destructive. It is a female image
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>because of the shape and the mythology. According to the traditions of the Klickitat
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Indians, the volcano is Loo-Wit, the old woman, keeper of fire. She mediated a dispute
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>between the two peoples in the area by sharing her fire. When the dispute recurred, she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and the two leaders were transformed into Mt. St. Helens, Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams. We
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>called this issue of Heresies &quot;Earthkeeping/Earthshaking&quot; because we plan to do both.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The eruption of Mt. St. Helens is our symbol of the “revolt of nature” because we know
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the important role feminist culture will play in that revolution.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Rachel Carson’s success as scientist and writer in her government career stemmed
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>from the fortunate fact that she was unusually capable, intelligent and well-trained,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and so could take advantage of opportunities in a profession where women have to be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>much better qualified than men to achieve the same recognition and jobs
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>After the publication of Silent Spring, the part of the chemical industry that felt
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>itself threatened by the book went to great lengths to try to establish a public image of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Miss Carson as an emotional, reclusive, unstable person. That this was a direct contra
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>diction of her actual character did not deter them, any more than the contents of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>book and its supporting scientific data prevented them from denying the truth of what
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>she said and the things that they only claimed she had said.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The many honors she received in her lifetime, and even now, show the failure of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>these attacks to damage either her reputation or the validity of her writing. In this past
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>year she has been given, posthumously, the Presidential Medal of Freedom and has had
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a postage stamp issued in her honor. Still, some industry spokesmen continue to parrot
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the old charges, and these are found in twisted form in some supposedly friendly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>commentaries. Study of this continuing belittlement and denigration shows how a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>woman in her position may attract a particular kind of opposition, especially when
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>opponents cannot find substantive points to denounce.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Joseph B.C.White, in Famous Men and Women of Pittsburgh, writes that “much
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of the outrage was visited on Rachel Carson simply because she was a woman. Perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>if Dr. Rachel Carson had been Dr. Richard Carson the controversy would have been
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>minor and the book would not have had half its impact. At that period, anti-female
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fear lay at the base of a great portion of this controversy. The American technocrat
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>could not stand the pain of having his achievements deflated by the pen of this slight
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Others suggest that being a woman was part of the relatively invulnerable posi
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tion that made it possible for her to undertake Silent Spring. By then, she was finan
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>cially independent, well established as an honored scientist and author, and the res
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pect accorded her for her attainments and for her quiet, dignified character spared her
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the more brutal attacks suffered by some men who also spoke out on these issues.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>A subtler distortion comes from those who seem unable to accept accomplish
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ment from a woman who led a normal life, with the responsibilities, frustrations anc
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>pleasures common to most of us. They wish to make her a recluse, aloof from most
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>people, or unnaturally attached to her mother. Many insist that she was a “lonely”
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>child, kept home from school when ill by an “overprotective mother” and somehow
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>forced into a withdrawn life. Just once, it would be nice to have Mrs. Carson given
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>credit for managing to bring up a rather frail child under rigorous conditions. One
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>author was sure that Rachel and her mother were obsessively close because the family
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>moved to Baltimore while she was finishing her graduate studies there. In the depths
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of the Depression, it simply made sense for them to join resources where the best job
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>possibilities were. When her father and sister died soon thereafter, leaving two smal
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>nieces to raise, Rachel got a full-time job to support the family. Mrs. Carson’s role in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Rachel’s career has received too little appreciation. She must have regretted Rachel’s
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>giving up further graduate study as much as Rachel did, but they had no choice. Later,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Mrs. Carson supplied the support that all professional people need. Men tend to have
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>wives; women in well-paid jobs can hire housekeeping and secretarial help. Mrs. Carson
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>did all of this, as well as take the main share of raising the young girls. She typed the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>manuscript for The Sea Around Us (said by Oxford University Press to be the only
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>perfect manuscript received in their 500 years). I know many successful women who
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>say they could not have done their jobs without such help from their mothers; in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Rachel’s case this was surely so
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Another writer claims she had no interest in parties or sports in school, though
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>her letters from that time certainly contradict this, and he concludes, “she appar
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ently was never close to anyone.” We who were her friends shudder at the dour, in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>tense person this conjures up-in such contrast to the boundless zest and humor with
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>which she met each new situation, and shared so generously with us.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>didn’t care if its workers ate plutonium,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>as long as it made its profits. She didn&apos;t

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>was used for drinking and recreation.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>And she didn’t know yet that by July
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>1974, 73 workers would be internally
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>contaminated by plutonium—or that she
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would be one of them. “The whole

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the AEC for only eight of them).
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Soon after Karen started working,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the local OCAW (Oil, Chemical and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Atomic Workers union) went on strike
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>against KM for better training, better

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>one of the last holdouts, but the strike
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>failed. After seeing the workers defeated
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>even though they should have gotten
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>what they asked for, she became a strong

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>conditions at KM.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>In the spring of 1974 Karen noticed
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the assembly line speed up. The turn
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>over of workers was nearly 60%. New
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>workers were getting less and less train
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ing. Karen watched everything, listened
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to everything and took notes. On July
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>21, she discovered she had been con
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>taminated by plutonium. For more than
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>a year she had urged KM to buy a spe

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>it hadn’t arrived.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>The next month Karen won one of

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>committee. She went to Washington

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>International. They told the story of

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>They agreed, but told her, “Don’t do

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>She went back to work. The first

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>heard the complete story. The more
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>they learned, the stronger the union
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>grew. Karen spent her free time gather
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing evidence against KM on the dangers
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of plutonium. By now, a friend recall

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>stuff.” Karen started to lose weight.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>She couldn’t sleep. Friends tried to con

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>fusing word with many meanings. By

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ecological crisis. It includes species
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ism, the belief that humans are super

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>subtler manifestations. For example,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>since mind is associated with human

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>social structures. At best, they are pro

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>paid limited attention to nature. For
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>example, while they may discuss the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>In general, the two groups have been
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>far more hostile to each other than their
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>common concerns might suggest. Social
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>feminists may accuse nature feminists of

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>sume a separatist lifestyle. In defense,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>some respond that they are not simply
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>involved in personal liberation, that it
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>is necessary to change the symbol sys

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>(Starhawk, 1979). Those working to

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>feminist Wicca, are seeking symbols
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>that can transform our consciousness
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and thus our culture. Social feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>point out that conditions of survival in

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>feelings. The nature feminist seeks to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>preserve the planet as well as the species
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>in the face of destructive naturism and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>calls on women’s power to further the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>struggle. Elizabeth Dodson Gray (1979:
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>6) refers to naturism as “the most ruth

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>less’ mastering of all,” for if the plan
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>etary ecology is destroyed, all sexes,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>races, and classes will also be destroyed.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The historical bias of the social feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>all too often bypasses this fundamental
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>consideration. Social feminists are clear
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that a historical materialism which
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>omits the oppression of women is defec
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tive. But similarly, a social ethic which
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>does not fully include nature in its anal
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ysis is defective.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>As 1 observe this split between social
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and nature feminists, I find that each
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>has hold of something the other lacks.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Social feminists emphasize history and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>often disregard nature and biology;

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tures. This is the nature/history split;
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and it is, of course, a false split, a false
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>dualism. In actuality, one can derive
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>norms from history and still include
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>nature, for our relation to nature is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>part of our history. And one can derive
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>norms from nature and still include his
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tory, for human history is part of na
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ture.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>One reason for this split is the tra
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ditional separation, observable in many
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>disciplines, between history (human so

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>human). It seems especially acute with
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>in the behavioral sciences.1 This is a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>type of subject/object split that con
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>siderably antedates Descartes; the rela
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>tion of humanity and nature is perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the central question of all Western
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>philosophy (Colwell, 1970). One prob-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>lem is the puzzling fact that we are at
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>once part of nature and yet somehow
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>separate. On the one hand, humanity is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>part of the total ecology, the total inter
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>locking systems of the planet, and be
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>yond; and, on the other hand, we are
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>able to use and exploit our environ
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ment, to mold and shape its systems to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>our own purposes. In some sense, our
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>biology and our culture are in conflict
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>with each other; but, paradoxically,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>without our biology, we would have no
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>In the rest of this essay, I will set out
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>steps that seem necessary if feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>are to heal this split in our theory. We
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>need to build conceptual connections
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>between the four forms of oppression,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and it is particularly important to build
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>them between sexism, racism, classism
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>the three modes of human oppression
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>and naturism. I will then sketch some
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>special insights which nature and social
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>feminists offer each other, and briefly

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>This interstructuring is equally com

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>for the ruling class so that they have

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>is frequently perceived by the oppressed
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>as simply another means of preserving
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the elite’s status and affluence. Many in

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>This is how we view ourselves from a traditional point of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>view: Everything that is round is a power—the Sun, the Moon,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the Earth. The Moon is a female, our Grandmother. The Earth
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>is our Mother. She’s a female living spirit power. Our womb is
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>like a universal transport system that brings unborn spirits here
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>from the other world. When a woman goes to a hospital, if
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>she has a D &amp; C to scrape the womb, that universal energy is
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>taken out. When a woman uses an IUD or even tampons, she’s
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>weakened. We are trying, through survival schools, through our
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>traditional ways and the universal instruction, to bring our
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>women back into balance. Our unborn are sacred. At one time,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>our people could guarantee that the unborn would inherit
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>seven generations. Now we don’t even know if our children
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>are going to live.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We want to decide on our kind of health care. Our tradi
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tional medicine has always worked. They make it look like

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>men’s liberation because it makes a separation. But a lot of our
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>people have been influenced by that. Women are trying to free

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>our families together; but for us, it’s coming apart because our
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>children are institutional babies. If our women don’t fit the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>standard for living, they take our children and send them to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>boarding schools to accept the white world. We’re on govern
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ment welfare that’s designed to keep us like that. On some
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>reservations, you can’t own a home, you can’t own a car, so
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>you don’t meet the standards. We’re not allowed to be Red
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and we sure can’t be White. All that causes many imbalances
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>physical, emotional, mental. The elders are the teachers of our
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>children, but our own religious ceremonies are illegal.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>We can doctor ourselves. We have herb stores, but who
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>picked the herbs? Was it a woman on her Moon Time? Anyone
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>white and rich can go to medical school, but it doesn’t mean
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>they can heal. All these things are like a traditional language,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>a sacred communication. It’s not mystical or magical. It’s just
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>being in harmony with the natural laws of the universe, be
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>cause they do exist. Just because Galileo and Newton didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>discover them, doesn’t mean they don’t exist. We don’t follow
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>men—except the traditional elders and medicine men, like

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>people in our tribal governments who believe we should forget
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>who we are and adapt, or believe we should have two cars and

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>those who are selling us out. We cannot sell our Mother. These
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>people got away from their original instruction and started
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>using the white man’s tools. They call it red tape; I call it

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>met Lois at a gathering in the Black Hills in 1979, when over

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>would devastate all life and land. At the gathering there was a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>large number of lesbians, some carrying a banner reading
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>“Lesbians in Support of the Black Hills Alliance. A woman

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>though Lois is not a lesbian herself, she was supportive when
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I told her about the incident. She said that whoever that

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>LOIS: Because in our culture, we have a word for people who
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>make the preference of being gay or lesbian, and they are
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>called “Winktah.” They decided to be that way when humans
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>were being created. Their role as humans in this cycle was to
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>see both sides of a person’s identity, both female and male.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>In my own particular band of Dakotas, the Winktah people
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>picked our campsites to determine what was going to be best
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>for the men and women, as far as being protected, as far as

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Our whole concept of those people has always been that
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they are spiritual. That stopped when missionaries came. In
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>translating the language from Indian to English, missionaries
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>intentionally left out many words, many definitions of sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>roles. And they brought words to us. People living in one lodge
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>needed to find separate rooms for the parents so the kids don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>see them. Boys should be raised differently so that we don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>have any ideas coming to them about having a preference. And
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the women, too, they should be placed in certain areas. It
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>was an intentional plan to erase all of that out of our culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Anybody who deviated from that, instead of spiritual, was
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>considered weird. So Dakota or Lakota women showing any

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>are “behind the times.” I think when we go over to the Gath-

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>out here with cultural Indian women and lesbian people and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>this is what we’ve decided as a result of this meeting. Writing
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>your history of your struggle in the city would help. I was in
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>this community when there was a lot of bashing heads. People
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>coming out and throwing bricks at lesbian and gay people,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>just for standing up for what they believe. This was about ten
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>years ago.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>CAROL: I tried to put an article in a feminist newspaper after
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the Black Hills Gathering last summer saying there was some

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>gles, and they criticized it, saying that it was racist, that you
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>couldn’t compare struggles like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>LOIS: Well, l’ve met a few gay Indian women in the city and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>they don’t come around the Indian community. They don’t go
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to the Pow Wows, they don’t associate with Indian people in
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the athletic groups or with the church groups or anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>They identify with the gay community. Just recently there
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>were about three or four of us who went out to a restaurant/
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>bar type place. There was a pool table in the back and there
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was a Navajo woman there playing pool. I told her to come
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>join us and she felt uncomfortable. So 1 said, “Well, it’s o.k.,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>come on, we’re all Indians. And she said, “Yeah, you’re all
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Indians, but the rest of us here are lesbians.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>CAROL: Did you know that this was a lesbian bar?
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>LOIS: No. So 1 thought about that for a while and real quick
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>it flashed, “How much does she know about her culture as
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>far as our own concept of gay people?” And why would she
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>feel comfortable being with the Indian community when there
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>was a lot of prejudices left? So what was her choice? She
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>finished her pool game and came over and we were all talking
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and we had a good time. I gave her my phone number and told
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her to call me. I haven’t heard from her. It definitely is a com
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>munity of people who think they have to leave other things
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>behind. They think there’s a boundary line they can’t cross.

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N001'/>Around 1817, when Spanish colonists first set foot on the Cayo Loco— a key off the South Coast
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N002'/>of Cuba near the city of Cienfuegos—they found a sole inhabitant. She was a young Black woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N003'/>nude except for necklace and bracelets of seeds and seashells, and so lovely that &quot;the most demand
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N004'/>ing artist would have considered her an example of perfect feminine beauty.” She was a survivor of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N005'/>innumerable generations of the Siboney Indians, who had been extinguished by colonization. They
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N006'/>called her the Black Venus.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>At the sight of the Spaniards, she ran—from fear rather than modesty. They caught her and dis
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>covered she was mute. Living alone on the Cayo Loco, she was accompanied everywhere by a white
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N009'/>dove and a blue heron. Spreading their wings, they would touch her mouth with their beaks, in
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N010'/>silent caress.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N011'/>When one of the colonists took her home with him, gave her food and clothing, he expected
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N012'/>her to please him and to work for him in return. But taken from her island freedom, and unable to
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N013'/>speak, she nestled in a corner, refusing to get up, work or eat. Finally, alarmed at the prospect of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N014'/>her death by starvation, they took her back to the Cayo Loco to live in freedom.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N015'/>From time to time over the years, the citizens of Cienfuegos tried again to “civilize” the Black
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>Venus. But each time her passive protests forced them to return her to the key, where she reigned in
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N017'/>solitude with the blue heron and the white dove her only subjects
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N018'/>The historian Pedro Modesto recalled that when he was a child, around 1876, an old Black
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N019'/>woman, with hair like a huge white powder puff and naked except for a blue, red and white neck
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N020'/>lace, secretly entered his house. She refused clothing and was dressed only by physical force. She
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N021'/>refused all the food offered her except for native products—yucca, bananas and sweet potatoes.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N022'/>The next morning she had disappeared, leaving the clothes behind. That was the last time she was
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N023'/>seen.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N024'/>Today the Black Venus has become a legendary symbol against slavery. She represents the

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N002'/>photograph, art object, plant, etc., and feed them into the shredding machine that 1 have made
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N003'/>(and painted like a ’60s sculpture). With the grey pile 1 light a bonfire that lights up the whole area
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N004'/>(all the way to London?) and then my children and I dance around it. Crowds gather, and when the

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N006'/>II. In the Present: My loved ones, R and C, help me with a performance idea 1 have—we build the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>structure together from my design, but with their encouragement and help. It is a cage, which
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>place in a public place (public art) and sit inside with my children. People look in and explain what

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>had seen them, of course. The clusters of trailer

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that of the songs-a combination of fear, suspicion
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and romance.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>My own involvement with the travelers began
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>about six years ago when I too was living in a caravan
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as a member of a traveling theater company and was
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>forced to confront the active discrimination against
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>travelers which exists in English law. I found hostility
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and suspicion directed against me purely because
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>lived in a trailer. While fighting this discrimination,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>met gypsies and got on well with them. Finally
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>helped to set up a mobile school and visited unofficial
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sites as a literacy teacher. The gypsies’ decision to in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>volve outsiders was due to their increasing awareness
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that as they were forced more and more into contact
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>with housedwelling society, bureaucracy was fencing

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>casual and mobile work. They scavenge the cities for
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>scrap metal and anything of value to buy and sell.

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>they faced increased prejudice and victimization.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>They were constantly forced to move on, even though
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>there was no legal place they could move to. When
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they were driven into closer contact, clashes between
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the gypsies and the housedwellers became inevitable,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>intensified on both sides by fear and ignorance. Many

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>for the gypsies.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>All this puts immense pressure on the gypsy
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>woman. She lives from day to day under constant
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>threat of eviction and fine, often unable to work be
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cause the family is moved so frequently. The chil

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>care. It is a struggle just to survive. Facing this har
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>assment outside, the gypsy woman relies on the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>support of her own society. Here she suffers from a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>different kind of oppression. The travelers have sur
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>vived in a hostile environment through resourceful
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ness, adaptability and the great strength of their
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>family structure. Extended families travel together
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>in groups, and by visiting other relations on occa
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>sions of birth, sickness, marriage or death, they
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>maintain a countrywide network of kinship and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>mutual support.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Within the family, sex roles are traditional and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>strictly maintained. From girlhood, the woman’s
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>responsibilities are clear. As soon as she is old enough
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>-say, seven or eight—she accompanies her mother as

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>furniture or scrap metal, hawking lace, charms or
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>flowers, reading palms. Whatever her trade, her

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the eldest girl in the family, she has demanding dom
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>estic responsibilities. It is her job to wash and dress
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the younger children in the mornings and take care of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>them on the campsite, releasing her mother to go out
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>with the other children. She must also clean the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>trailer each day, polish the mirrors and the chrome,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>wash the lace and maintain the high standard of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>cleanliness expected. If the father of the family takes
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sole charge of earning the money, then she will share
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the domestic and caring role with her mother. In
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>some Welsh families it is accepted that the woman
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>both earns the money and fulfills all the domestic
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and mothering tasks with the help of her daughters.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The man and his sons have no demands made on their
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>time.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>As a teenager the traveler girl lives under much
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>stricter moral control than her gauje contemporaries.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>She is discouraged from taking drugs of any sort and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>is probably not allowed to go out with a boyfriend
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>much before the age of 17. Sex is a taboo in conver
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sation. Even at 17, her courtship may be chaperoned
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>in the old style and will probably lead to an early
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>marriage, when the cycle will begin again. In this
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>domain, the gypsy families emphasize their separate
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ness from the housedwelling society. They express
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>great concern about the low standards of gauje moral
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ity and wish to preserve their children from its influ
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ence. Bill and Rita Price, for instance, disapproved of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>their 15-year-old daughter Googy’s friendship with a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>girl from a house near their camp, and were anxious
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>about her supposed promiscuous attitudes. When
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>asked Googy about it, she laughed at her parents’
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>concern. “They just think that I shall want to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>boyfriend,” she said. “They needn’t bother. 1 know
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that 1 can’t have that kind of friendship till 1 am
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>about 18.” Her parents had no need to worry. Their
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>standards of behavior, preserved in their close com
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>munity and absorbed since birth, were a complete
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>part of Googy’s approach to life.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The gypsy women were very curious about my
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>way of life, and many found it hard to understand
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>why 1 was happy to work quite separately from my
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>family. Some of them, however, said how much they
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>would appreciate the chance to do some things for
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>themselves. Marge, who became my good friend, des
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>perately wanted to write a novel. She had been in a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>foster home for a while as a child and so had learned
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>to read and write. She was upset by the generally dis

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>velers and wanted to tell her story in her own way
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>to set the record straight. But there was no time or
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>space in her life which would enable her to do this.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Within the travelers’ family pattern there does not
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>seem to be any notion of the independent woman, or
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the woman on her own. A girl lives with her parents
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>until her marriage, when she is set up in her own
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>trailer with her husband. The young couple will con

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>relations. Babes, a woman in her mid-twenties, with
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>three children, told me that she had never in her life
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>been out socially without either her father or her hus
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>band in attendance. She did not expect social free
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>dom, but just occasionally, she said, she would love
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to be able to go to see a film entirely on her own.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>She wanted the experience of being alone, which was
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>completely denied to her.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Thus, a gypsy woman’s life is entirely circum

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>witness for a 13-year-old gypsy who had been in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>volved in an incident with a gauje boy. Before the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>case was heard, we all gathered in the foyer of the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>court. On one side sat the gauje boy alone with his
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>mother, silently waiting. Spread all across the other
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>side of the large room was the gypsy boy’s entire
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>family—his mother and father, his brothers and sis
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ters, uncles, aunts and cousins, a grandmother who
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>could barely stand and a baby in a pram, busy with
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>its bottle. They took over the whole place, anxiously

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>darity and concern.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>In accepting these roles by which the family as
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>a whole will survive on a stable economic basis, the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>traveler women demand that they be respected and
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>maintained on their own terms. The trailer caravans
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>are their palaces, and they take immense pride in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the shining mirrors, gleaming chrome, priceless por
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>celain and cut glass. Whether they are illegally on the

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the trailer itself, its condition inside and out, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>display of china and glass testify to a woman’s cur
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>rent status, as does the gold jewelry she wears. The
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>trailer is her security and the one part of her environ
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ment over which she has control. Despite the short
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>age of water (all water has to be collected and storec
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>in milk churns and often has to be paid for by the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>gallon), there is a high standard of cleanliness. Nearly
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>all the trailers are painted white and decorated with
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>highly polished chrome, and they are kept spotless,

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>are even easier tokens of exchange. The constant
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>dealing in these goods marks fluctuations in the fam

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>At any moment, the gypsy woman is what she has
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and wears. She tends to be the keeper of the family
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>wealth, whether it is housed in porcelain, gold jewel
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ry, sovereigns or pound notes. This is a practical
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>arrangement, as it is the man of the family who is
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>most likely to be picked up by the police. If he
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>should be taken away, his wife will be able to main-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tain the family until his return. This arrangement also
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>provides the woman’s status within her group. The
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>display of china in her wall cabinets and the rings on
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her fingers may give her husband pride in possession,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>but they also give her matriarchal power. I once saw
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>a grandmother holding court in her trailer; as she told
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a cluster of granddaughters and nieces of the things
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>she had seen and the places she had visited, she
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cleaned her gold—rings, earrings, sovereign pendants,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>bracelets. One by one she dropped them into a cut
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>glass jug full of whiskey and swirled them around.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In the past 30 years, the gypsy woman’s relation
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ship to the land has changed. Once her life was very
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>much in sympathy with her landscape—which was an
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>extension of her home. Living in a trailer with a large
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>family was not oppressive because almost every activ
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ity was done outside. The trailers were mainly used
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>for sleeping. The woman made a fire outside wherever
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the family stopped, and this became the heart of the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>camp. All cooking was done here in big black pots
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>hung from iron tripods. Washing was boiled up in a
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tin bath and spread around on bushes to dry. The
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>children played around the fire, periodically homing
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in on it when the adults gathered to exchange news
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and tell stories. In the evenings everyone gathered
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>there for warmth, to overhear gossip and to watch
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and listen to singing and step-dancing. Living close to
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the land also enabled the gypsies to keep the animals
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and find the food they needed. The women gathered
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>herbs and the knowledge of mixing medicines and
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>preparing oils and creams for healing was passed on
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>from mother to daughter. Most rubbish was burned
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>on the fires and it was rare to find a messy camp.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Today little of this is possible. For those still on
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the road, there are few camping places available.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Many of the old grounds have been built over; others
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>have been fenced in; others have been trenched by
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>bulldozers to prevent trailer access, so great is gauje
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>prejudice against gypsy occupation. The few acces
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>sible places are likely to be cramped and in unplea
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>sant or dangerous surroundings, close to sewage
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>works, near main roads or on derelict waste plots.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Denied physical or safe space, the traveler family is
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>forced to spend far more time in the crowded trailer.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>It is often not safe to let the children roam and ex
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>plore. I have seen toddlers roped to trailer wheels to
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>protect them from traffic. Recently a child was
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>killed by his own father’s truck as he tried to back
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>it around in a tiny waste plot.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>In urban areas, campfires are often not toler

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>washing; they cook inside their trailers. But their
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>trailers are more precious now, as they are the wo-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>men’s only welcoming space, the only places the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women can call their own. Many have a second,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>older trailer which they use as a kitchen, rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>spoil the shine of the modern stove in their main
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>trailer and let the smells and steam pervade their
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>whole living space. Several middle-aged gypsy women
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>know keep and treasure their old black pots, often
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>passed on from their grandmothers. Whenever they
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>get the chance to have a fire outside, they cook in the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>old way, not only to keep from tarnishing their beau
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tiful new stoves, but also because they want to keep
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>in touch with the old life.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Though families without official site pitches have
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a place to be without threat of eviction, these sites
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>too are usually unpleasant, out-of-the-way places.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Built on dumps, disused airfields, industrial waste
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lands, they are often fenced concrete compounds
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>claustrophobic ghettos ringed with regulations,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>many of which actively prevent the families from
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>earning their customary living; it is a rare site that
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>incorporates a work area in its design. The travelers
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>dislike living in such surroundings as much as any of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>us, but they have no options except to be illegally
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>on the road again.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Faced with these restrictions and also with the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>fact that it is no longer economically feasible to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>travel the customary routes to find work, and lose
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the security of the site pitch, many families have
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>been forced to apply for social security payments.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The women hate this loss of independence which
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>destroys their pride and self-respect. Yet for the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sake of the children, the chance for them to have
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>some security and to have a formal education, many
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>stay on the sites.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The site policy also prevents family gatherings
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>from being held in the old way. The number of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>pitches per site are limited and it is often impos
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sible for relations to move on to a site with their
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>trailers to share in mourning or celebration. The kin
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ship network is being weakened. About five years
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ago, 300 gypsies gathered together to mourn a death
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>on the edge of the main road north from London.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>They emptied the sites and defied eviction for the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>time of mourning. There was nowhere else they could
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>gather and they were determined to give the old man
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the traditional rites he wanted. Many women see the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>sites as one step toward eventual settlement in houses
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and fear this gradual assimilation as the destruction of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>their lifestyle and culture. On the sites the women are
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>becoming more isolated; they are cut off from their
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>extended families but not integrated with gauje
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>society. They derive no solace from their uncom
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>promisingly barren surroundings. Many are severely
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>depressed and have been given prescriptions for
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>valium.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Another negative ecological change stems from
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>the travelers’ altered diet. There is an increasingly
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>short supply of wild herbs and medicinal plants, and
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the knowledge of their use is being lost. I asked an
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>old woman if she still used herbal cures. She said she
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>couldn’t find the plants anymore. Looking around at
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the barren concrete site that was now her home as if
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>she saw it for the first time, she said, “It’s all built on,

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>jobs done, the gypsies are beginning to rely on super
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>markets. As these are inevitably more expensive,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>people are drawn still further into the cities to make
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>money for food. I was once in a supermarket with a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>young gypsy woman when another shopper hit her in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the face without warning or provocation, shouting at
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>her to get out. Such hostility and abuse are not un
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>common. The gypsy woman told me that she was
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>used to such treatment; she regarded most gaujes as
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>rude, intolerant, aggressively bigoted people.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>With nothing but their families and trailers to rely
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>on, the gypsies are coming to despise the land con
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>trolled by the gaujes, which once supported them. On
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>unofficial sites today, rubbish is often left to lie
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>where it was thrown from the trailer; paper, bottles
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and cans litter the ground. Inside, high standards of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>hygiene are preserved, but the lànd outside is no
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>longer part of that home. It is ironic that now, when
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>we are all becoming more ecologically conscious,

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>before the Industrial Revolution. Amazingly enough in those

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>have been profligate in our breeding habits and appetites. In
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the space of a little over 150 years we have almost exhausted
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the finite stock of energy resources which, aside from coal,
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>were only discovered in the last century. Having done so, we
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>have inflated our expectations and technologies to a degree
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that can be supported only as long as these resources last
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The abundance was misleading and relatively short-lived
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>While it lasted, it created the illusion that technology gave us
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the power to outwit Nature and overcome basic cosmic laws.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>At the same time we lost all sense of responsibility for our
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>physical environment and came to rely more and more on
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>experts, rather than on the common sense and evolved wis
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dom that enabled previous societies to live and flourish with

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>But this era, in which people are called consumers instead
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of citizens, is ending. The utopian promises of industrial so
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ciety—the end of poverty, disease, illiteracy and hunger—have
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>not materialized, and it is doubtful that they ever will. If there
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>was ever a golden age of industrialism, it is over. The abun
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>dance of material wealth that has slipped through the fingers
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of Western industrial society will never be possessed by the
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Third World. The finite pie will have to be sliced very dif
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ferently, and this in turn will mean new political and economic
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>structures and geographical relationships.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Now, it is not very pleasant to talk about the end of afflu
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ence. I prefer to call it an end to profligacy and a redefining of
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>economics in its traditional sense—the science of efficient and
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>equitable allocation of resources, not the science that maxi

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and of future generations. This may sound like the doom
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>sayers condemning the masses to starvation, but it is really
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the reverse. The fact is that industrial, growth- and profit
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>oriented societies have not visibly alleviated starvation.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Traditionally, our religious faith in technology has made us
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>see the biosphere’s economy as an infinitely expanding one.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Rejection of this faith entails rejection of many articles of
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>faith—the marketplace, free enterprise, and other artifacts of
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the global consumer economy. It also means rejecting the

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>processes of Nature—what ecologist David Ehrenfeld calls
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>“the arrogance of humanism.” Perhaps we need to admit that
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>not only may we be unable to do anything we want, but that
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>we may have to reject some desired things in their entirety.

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>many people take the time to tell us
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>what these dangers are. I recently met a

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and she has been working with a dentist

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>but the dentist never bothered to tell

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>We have to start thinking of how it af
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>fects us in the workplace.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>We have also heard from Terri
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Goldberg about genetic manipulation.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>This has touched all of us recently. It

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>familiar with the fact that many plants
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>are screening Black workers for sickle
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cell anemia. It’s another form of dis
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>crimination, and a form of paternal
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ism that tells us: “We are taking care of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>you. We don’t want you to go into these
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>jobs that are dangerous for you.” Well,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>that’s a bunch of bullshit! They don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>want us to work there and they have
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>found a new way of telling us not to do
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>it. That’s one of the reasons why wo
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>men need to start building alliances.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>You need to start extending your

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that’s discriminated against, that they
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>do it to all women. Just look at the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>place you work. Everyone has been
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>reading in the paper lately how women
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>have been kept out of factories that deal
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>with lead. In 1978, five women at
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>American Cyanamid in West Virginia
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>were asked either to be sterilized so that
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>they could work with lead or accept
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>lower pay for another job. Lead has
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>been found to affect fetuses, so they say
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>that because we are able to produce
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>children, they need to take care of us
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>again, they need to make it safe for us.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Therefore, as we move into the jobs that
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>men have traditionally held-high-pay-
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ing jobs—they suddenly have started to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>worry about our ability to reproduce. It
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>hasn’t happened before. Hospital work
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>ers, who are mostly women, are exposed
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to far more dangerous factors: radia
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tion, infections, miscarriages from anes
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>thetic gases. Nobody has tried to pro
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tect us from those things. They haven’t
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>even told us that they could affect us.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Also, when American corporations
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>started moving to Puerto Rico and other
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Third World areas, they needed cheap
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>labor, so what did they send out but an
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>American corporation to test birth con
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>trol on our women. Therefore, by 1968,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>a third of all Puerto Rican women of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>child-bearing age had been sterilized. It’s
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a way of making sure that women who
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>work for miser wages don’t get pregnant
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and interrupt production. And presently
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>electronics plants have moved to Mexico.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Electronics plants in the States employ
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>mostly women. They pay the minimal
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wages. A lot of bad things go down in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the shops, so the law in the United
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>States has started to put a little bit of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>pressure on these companies to clean up
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the workplaces. So they have decided
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that it is a lot better to transplant to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Mexico and Taiwan, where they can
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>employ Third World women. I mean,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>it’s no problem if we die, 1 guess. Amer
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ican women have to be protected and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the rest of us can die.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Some women who have joined the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>labor movement have found it very un
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>receptive to them and have decided:
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Well, it’s about time we made an im
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pact on it—and they have built alle
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>giances between unions and have
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>formed different unions that deal with
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>women’s problems. They have asked
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>companies to have better maternity
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>benefits; they have tried to force com
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>panies to clean the lead out of the place
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and make it safe for everyone. It isn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>only women who get affected by lead.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Men also get affected, but we could in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>stead be the ones that would help clean
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>up those places. We need to pay atten
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>tion to the unions that women are in,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>because they are controlled by white
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>males; they are company-owned unions,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and they really don’t look out for our
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>interests and if we keep saying we don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>want to deal with them because they
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>have never answered to women, they
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>will continue to not answer to women.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Those American women who are pre-
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>sently working in factories can be a
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>great help by asking that the work
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>place be cleaned up. You need to start
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>organizing. Everybody knows that 20
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>can speak louder than one, and as long

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Her mother would swat them anywhere,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>oblivious to Karen saying she’d just
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>killed her friend Anthony.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>It wasn’t her real mother who was
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>doing all of this to her, so Karen didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>feel bad. Her real mother had real green
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>skin and was a gypsy. She saw her on
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>her deathbed a few times, but never
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>after that. Never saw her dead. She
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>couldn’t tell later if her mother had
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>green skin because she was dying or if
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>it was just her natural coloring. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>glad&apos; when the lady at Merle Norman
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>said it was natural and she should wear
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>green eye shadow to match it.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Her new mother hadn’t told her any
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>thing about makeup. Her new mother
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>was too old to even think that there was
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>such a thing as makeup. Her new
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>mother was married into a trucking
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>firm, and you’d think she was a truck
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>if you weren’t careful. Karen was al
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ready positive that her older sister
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>about thirty-five already—was really a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>truck. She’d park herself up in the third
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>floor dispatch room over the garage and
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>make dirty truck sounds to the drivers
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>all day. Answer the phone like: “Yeeee-

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>like it was the only code she could
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>answer to, and if the guys recognized
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>her voice over the radio and she theirs
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>then they could “talk.” Not Talk, ex

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>like fucking. Not fuck.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Karen thought that the real story
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>behind this was what was inside the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>trucks. She’d smelled it coming in every
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>day. They’d park in the back lot; her
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>older sister would turn on Elvis Presley
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>real loud over the dispatch radio while
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>all the trucks were loading so that no
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>body would have to pay very much

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>attention to the loads. They’d come
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>into the office, they’d say “What am
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>loading?” “Can’t hear you,” she’d say.

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>reflecting some sunshine off one of his
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>wings. Boom! It was something on that
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>truck that wasn’t supposed to be there
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>dangerous, flammable, carcinogenic, etc.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>But they always told her she had to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>play near it. Never said a word when
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>she started mixing up the dust from the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>trucks and giving herself “beauty masks”
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>like she saw in the magazines.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>She was only trying to improve her
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>self. She was only trying to be modern.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>A modern girl was shiny from head to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>toe and had full-length new plastic
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>everything on in colors that would melt
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the eyeballs, so why not herself? From
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>her place in the dirt of the backyard she
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>could hear plastic calling as clear as a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>billboard ad for lipstick in the desert.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Nothing else around as red as those fake

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sky. But in order to achieve this plastic
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>image, she had to work hard because
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>there was no way that she could afford
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>any real plastic from head to toe.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Around the corner from the trucking
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>company was Main Street, and Karen
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>would sometimes take herself out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>backyard and walk along the shop win
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>dows to look at how she might improve
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>herself. The displays would be solid
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>colors reflecting the sunlight back at
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>her. As she passed from window to win
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>dow her face would take on the color of
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the sunlit backdrop. It was just dropped
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>from a roll like they had all the plastic
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>in the world, just lavishly dropped from
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ceiling to floor to obscure any idea that
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>this might be something other than a
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>dream you were looking at, certainly
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>not a store. The sweet translucent light
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>inspired Karen to just about gobble all
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the stuff down. One time she couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>stop licking at a half-dozen bright blue
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>bangle bracelets that jangled up and
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>down her bony arm. She also used to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>suck on small multicolored see-through
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>pink-and-yellow earrings and often had
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>to hold back the attempt to swallow
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>them all. A perfect suicide for Karen
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>would be to scarf the contents of some
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>body’s junk jewelry box instead of some
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>shiny sleeping pills. Before her insides

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>could be lacerated by the stuff, she’d
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>be lying down on satin pillows dreaming
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>about how she would be so pretty even
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>down to her soul, and including her
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>body. The plastic would float in
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>smoothly and in perfect color-coordina

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>otherwise she’d be really scared of.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>She thought it was the most demo

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>anyone, especially she, could die within
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>minutes because of their beauty.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>She thought about her beautiful dead

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wound wherever you traveled, and she’d
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>found it everywhere.

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>above the rank and file, I was trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>act better than all the other workers
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>who had to breathe the stuff every day.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>It was the bootstrap that pushed me
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>back down where I belonged.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>One day at work I fell off a ladder
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>into the catalyzer and there was an ex

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>was left alone inside the vat where the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>chemicals came together and I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>was going to die. Pictures of the begin
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ning of the plant flew across my mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>It was my fifth birthday and my
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>grandfather had just bought a new car
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that was rusting under the floorboards.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>could see the road whiz by under
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>neath the car as we sped along gravel
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>roads to the plant. We were going to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>visit the factory on my birthday. Back
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>roads would get thicker with strange
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>color smoke as we approached. The
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>smell would get stronger. Within sight of
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the plant I held up my arms in front of
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>my face, but Grandpa picked me up and
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>held me up to the smokestacks.

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>As I lay at the bottom of that mixer,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>smoke began to come in and twirl

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>looked like birds that were moving in

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>As a radio journalist since 1973, 1 have reported dozens of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>environmental struggles. Everywhere I looked, women were
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>leading their communities, organizing the fight for survival.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Many were politically involved for the first time, in response
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to threats to their traditional concerns: families, homes and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>future generations. It is startling to hear ordinary women.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>casually discussing genetic questions and toxic exposure. “lf
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>1have a child, will it be deformed?” That question raises the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>same issues about our technologysculture society as do those

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>dish. Both point to the political, ethical and ecological impli
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cations of our efforts to control nature. The scientists are
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>deciding how we will use technological knowledge; the women
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>are dealing with the consequences of past decisions.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>To quibble about whether ecological issues are feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>issues is to ignore the question of control over our bodies
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>which will shape the rest of our lives as women. Meanwhile,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>women who have never been involved in feminism are being
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>propelled into public life by these questions. As surely as the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>lives of middle-class feminists were transformed by other issues
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>(such as whether to have children or how to break into the

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with their children and their homes, will be transformed by

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Lois Gibbs is President of the Love Canal Homeowners
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Association, which was in large part responsible for the August
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>1978 declaration of the health emergency there, for the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>government’s eventual evacuation of worst-hit areas and for
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>state and federal compensation to homeowners. The following
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>is a revision of Gibbs’ speech at the “Women and Life on
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Earth” Conference at Amherst, Mass., in March 1980. Since
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>then, researchers have found evidence of chromosome damage
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>among Love Canal residents.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>The women of Love Canal are much like myself—house
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>wives, mothers. Most have a high school education. We are
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>lower-middle-class families with our biggest investment our
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>home, and our most precious asset our children. The majority
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>did not work but remained home tending to houses, gardens
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and growing children. Since the Love Canal exposure, this way
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>of life has changed. Women are no longer at home, because
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>it is unsafe; we’re not allowed to go near our gardens. The
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>decisions have changed too, from normal everyday questions
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>such as: What are we going to have for dinner? Where are we
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>going on vacation? What color shall we paint the walls? Now
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the decisions are: How can we afford a new home? Will my
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>baby have leukemia? Will my daughter ever have a normal
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>baby? What will we do with our sick child? We can’t move
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>and we can’t stay here.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Women prior to the Love Canal disaster were very sort of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>square, I guess. Women who at one time looked down on
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>people picketing, being arrested and acting somewhat radical
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>are now doing those very things. Now women who would

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>office, conducting phone surveys, going from door to door.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Up until August 2, 1978, when the New York State Health
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Department declared an emergency, the majority of the people
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>living around the canal did not know there were toxic wastes
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>buried in their neighborhood. We became suspicious in June,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>when the state began to investigate. My son had experienced
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>health problems since he attended the 99th Street School, and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Ibegan to go from door to door trying to close the school, not
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>realizing myself the extent of the danger. That changed
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>quickly when 1 received the education of a lifetime. People
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>were very open and willing to talk. They began to tell of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>health problems, crib deaths, cancer and children crippled with
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>brain damage and deformations. Everyone signed my petition
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with almost no resistance, but they were still not willing to
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>actively participate in a group form. They were waiting until
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the state studies were completed. The truth of the matter is
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>they did not quite believe they were affected yet. The families
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>had a blind faith in the government. They refused to believe
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the Board of Education would build an elementary school or
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that the city would allow them to build their homes in a dan
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>gerous area. They knew there were strong odors, black gunk
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and other strange substances on the canal, but did not realize
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the dangers they represented.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>When the state held an open public meeting in August, in
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Albany, 500 miles away, and released their study results,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>people became involved. At this meeting the Health Depart-
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ment recommended that the 99th Street School be closed,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that pregnant women and children under two leave the neigh
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>borhood, that families not eat food from their home gardens
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and limit the time spent in their basements. The results
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>showed air readings in some homes around the canal to be
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>above OSHA standards and the miscarriage and birth defect
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>rates to be above normal.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The first few days after this announcement it was mass
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>panic. The residents were scared to death and did not know
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>where to turn. This made my job easier. I had a familiar face
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>because of my door-to-door campaign and now everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>wanted to be involved. I held the first Love Canal Home
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>owners Association meeting that same week to organize an
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>effective pressure group to force the government and Hooker
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to protect our families. We had at that time over 500 people
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>as members. We now have over 500 families—thousands of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>people. We had many advantages—a large number of people
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>who felt their lives were being affected, and dedicated people
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>like Dr. Beverly Paigen, who were willing to work long hard
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>hours without payment to make sure Love Canal was properly
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>evacuated and cleaned up. These people 1 believe deserve a
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>medal.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>In February 1979, the Health Department ordered the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>evacuation extended to a six-block area, but only after con

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>own health surveys, we have found the birth defect rate in the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>outer Love Canal neighborhood to be 56% and the miscarriage
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>rate to be between 50 and 75%. Defects range from mental
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>retardation to disfigurements: triple ears, double rows of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_8_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>teeth, extra fingers and toes. This is very frightening to a good

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>starting their own families. Although most women do not
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>intend to conceive, because of the known risk, there is always
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the fear of accidental pregnancy. They must now wonder:
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Am 1 going to have a normal baby? Will it live? Should I have
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>an abortion?” Pregnancy is supposed to be a happy time.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>This is just one of the problems. Many of these toxic com
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>pounds remain in the body. We have to wonder whether just
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>moving from Love Canal will be enough to allow us to have
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>normal babies; whether our children will be able to have nor
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>mal pregnancies—my daughter, for instance. And these are
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>just the obvious effects of the chemicals. There are many
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>others, like diseases of the central nervous system, including
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>nervous breakdowns, migraine headaches and epilepsy. We
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>have not conducted a cancer survey, but we have found many
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women with breast or uterine cancer, and it is not just middle
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>aged women. A 12-year-old child had to have a hysterectomy.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>There are people with urinary problems, brain damage and so

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Many women, especially the active ones, have been faced
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>with another major problem—their marriages. Most of them
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>were homemakers. Dinner was ready at five, laundry was done,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and children were properly cared for. Now, in many house
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>holds, dinner is not ready at five, laundry is not quite done,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and the neighbor is taxiing the children around. The husbands
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>are forced to do these things—to be satisfied with hamburgers
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>at McDonald’s three times a week, with taking care of the chil
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>dren more. The husbands feel helpless because they cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>protect their families and are also jealous because their wives
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>are now working with other men in the office. The result of all

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>There are pressures and decisions that no normal marriage is
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>subjected to: Will we walk away from our homes and our
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>savings to protect our children? It’s easy for you sitting in the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>audience to say, of course. But think about it. Think about
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>packing the clothes in your closet and walking away to start all
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>over again with nothing—no savings, no furniture, no money,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>children who are always hungry and ten thousand dollars a
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>year.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>The first thing we learned when we started organizing was
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>how valuable the media can be. We learned what would get
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>us national attention, like our survey on women who became
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>pregnant during the construction of the containment system
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>on the canal proper. During this period there was additional
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>air contamination from open trenches. There were 15 preg
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>nancies during this time. Of the 15, only one normal baby was
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>born. All the rest ended in miscarriages, birth defects or dis
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>eased children.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>We organized rallies and protests around times when cover
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>age was slow throughout most of the state. We found thaf
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>numbers, long chemical names and statistics confused people,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>so we arranged a series-a horror story of the day. One
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>family, in their home, would tell of their problems: a mother
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>would explain how her baby died or had three major birth
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>defects, or a family would reveal that state officials told them
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>not to go into their basement, their son’s bedroom or their
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>kitchen because of chemical readings—and then the state
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>would publicly announce there was no problem there. This
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>was very successful and we received a large response. Readers
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>became furious with the government for allowing this to con
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>tinue.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>We also found the media very helpful in pushing the govern
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>ment to do what is right. In August 1979, Governor Carey was
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>running for reelection. We held a public meeting and asked:
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Where is the Governor? Is he campaigning instead of taking
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>care of the emergency situation in his state? What are his
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>priorities? Two days later Governor Carey visited Love Canal,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>stood on stage in front of hundreds of people who were
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>screaming “Murderer, help our children,” with both men
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and women crying. Cameras rolled. The whole state watched,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>so he told everyone that the state would buy their homes at
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>fair market value. Now he was a hero. He was reelected. We
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>found that one thing government cannot stand is a confron
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tation of men, women and children out in the street protesting
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and pleading for help in front of the press.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>We have also found the media a good source for getting
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>information from the Health Department, Department of En
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>vironmental Conservation, etc. We would write a letter re
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>questing information. If we received no answer (or a political
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>answer, which is the same), we would give both letters to the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>press. If they couldn’t get an answer either, the reporter would
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>get angry and write an adverse article on the department and
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the person heading it.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Within our own organization we had some minor problems
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>because of the large number of people involved, but never any
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>thing serious. One thing we found very important is communi
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>cation between the office and residents. We found the more
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>communication you have, the more people will become inter
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ested and involved, and it eliminates suspicions and gossip. We
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>try to send out newsletters as often as possible, even if we have
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>nothing new to say. We had block representatives for residents
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to call if they had a question. This was also a way to involve
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>more people actively and give a job to someone who felt left
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Although Love Canal may be the first, it is definitely not
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the only real toxic waste problem. Because we have received
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>national media coverage, citizens call us from all over the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>country. Many of them tell us of wastes buried in their back
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>yards and health problems they believe are not normal. The
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>whole toxic waste issue affects everyone. There are thousands
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of known poisonous dumps across the country and many
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>unknown ones. These dump sites are invading our land, air
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and drinking water, and they must be cleaned up. Because of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the cost involved to clean and monitor each site, both govern
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ment and industry would like to ignore them. Meanwhile,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>innocent people are being hurt and profits are being made by
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>industry.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>The only way to clean up the sites properly and to avoid
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>new Love Canals being built is for people to force the govern
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ment to implement laws to stop careless disposal of toxic
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>wastes and force industries to clean up their own dumps.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>We, the taxpayers, should not bear the costs of clean up while
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the responsible party is sitting back making a profit. The one
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>thing you must understand is that it does affect you—you,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the taxpayer; you, the consumer; or you, the victim! Unless
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>you have thoroughly checked out your backyard and your
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>drinking water, you are not safe. We never knew about Love
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Canal when we moved in eight years ago. Your children may
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>move into an unsafe area as we did, unaware and innocent,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>only to suffer.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>II. PAT SMITH/THREE MILE ISLAND
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Pat Smith lives in Newberry Township, not far from Three
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Mile Island. She can see the nuclear plant’s cooling towers
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>from nearly every window in her house. Since March 28, when
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>the worst accident in the history of commercial nuclear power
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>took place there, she has become very active in the anti
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>nuclear movement, first in local groups demanding that Metro
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>politan Edison shut down the nuclear facility and now as a
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>speaker at national and international rallies. The following is
			</p>
			<pb n='44'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a combination of an interview and a speech she gave in April
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>1980 in Newark, N.].
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Exactly 12 months ago, 1 was a homemaker, 1 was a mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Iwas golfing five days a week. 1 had the ideal part-time job.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>had the perfect life. I was always happy, bubbly. Now such a
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>seriousness has taken over my life. God knows l’d give any
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>thing to go back to the lifestyle 1 had, but I can’t-if I want
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to sleep at night. Anything is less important than closing down
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Three Mile Island.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>We used to have a boat, and we’d always pull up right
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>below the plant, turn the motor off and let it drift out. We’d
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>take all our guests. “Got to show you these beautiful pyra
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mids.” You have to look straight up in the air, that’s how tall
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>they are. We just thought this was like a tourist attraction.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Wednesday, March 28 was the beginning of the drastic
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>change in my life. I was horrified at the news of radiation
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>releases on that day, and by the time my two daughters, 14
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and 11, returned home from school, I was in tears. All my
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>caution through the years—like not allowing my family too
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>many dental X-rays—suddenly was undone. I was relieved
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>when my husband agreed to take the girls north about 50
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>miles away that same evening.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>But then on Friday the 30th, about 10:30 in the morning,!
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>looked outside and saw a state policeman going from door to
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>door, telling residents to stay indoors, close all windows, turn
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>air conditioners off. He never stopped at my house because he
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>did not see a car in my driveway. But 1 called a neighbor and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>found out what he was doing.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I was alone, as were many other homemakers. How long
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>would 1 be a prisoner in my own home? Would my husband be
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>able to return to me that day? Suddenly I was scared—real
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>scared. And I decided to get out of there while I could. I took
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the car out of the garage, threw the suitcases in—not knowing
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>if I should breathe the air or not-and drove away as quickly
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>as I could. I didn’t dare turn the air conditioner on. I thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>at least if anything dreadful happens, l’Il be with my daughters.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>There was a lot of tension at my sister’s house. We watched
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the news every time it was on. Mental patients are always
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>wringing their hands. I found myself doing that all the time.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The least little thing would start an argument; you could
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>hardly have a decent conversation. There was no conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>except Three Mile Island. I made a vow that if I ever returned,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>I would devote my full time to closing down that nuclear
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>plant.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Iwent back home close to a week afterward. My husband,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>he’s a township supervisor, was invited to speak on the capitol
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>steps for our very first rally. My husband and 1 are staunch
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Republicans and always believed what the government said.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The only thing I ever did before was work at the polls twice
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a year. It was something for my strait-laced husband to speak
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>at a rally. He was the first to declare he was anti-nuclear. He
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>said, everyone go home and form your own little anti-nuclear
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>groups and, in turn, join together. Other people were ob
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>viously thinking the same thing, because when I returned
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>home the phone started ringing, with people saying, “Put
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>me on your list to fight Met Ed.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Now I go all over the country knocking the NRC and the
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>federal government. I love America and I get tears in my eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>when 1 sing “America the Beautiful.” But I think we’ve let it
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>get out of hand. I think our government needs a good house
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cleaning. And it’s got so bad I told my two kids, maybe some
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>day your mother will end up in jail.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>always said I could control my life, and 1 have. I went
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>away to college; I knew when 1 wanted to get married. I wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>going to have kids for so many years. A perfect mother’s sup
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>posed to stay home and raise her kids, so l did that for almost
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>13 years. It wasn’t the happiest time, because I thought 1 had
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>a lot to give, but my husband came from a broken home and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>he wanted our daughters to know their mother’s always there.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Then I knew I was going to get that perfect part-time job.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was going to be the best golfer around. Suddenly I can’t con
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>trol it anymore. All 1 can see in the future is going out and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>speaking like this.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Q.: Does that make you think differently about yourself
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>speaking in public?
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Very much so. l’m told that 1 can reach people, perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>emotionally. I didn’t know 1 had this within me. And if that
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>is a talent, indeed, I must use it. I was sheltered to a point.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Now l’m so happy because of the people l’ve met. l’m so
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>aware of so many more things politically.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>They try to tell us we’re emotional. Yeah, l’m emotional
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>about the whole thing. It’s been hell livingthere for 12 months.

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of smoldering slag heaps-strip mines. They remain fixed in

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>people do anything about ecological problems until some

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Ecotage” is a combination of “ecology” and “sabotage.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>It refers to the use of guerrilla tactics ranging from civil
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>disobedience to overt sabotage that can be executed “with-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>out injury to life systems.”1 These acts are performed by
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>people who hope to stimulate public awareness about en
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>vironmental issues and to gain press coverage that exposes
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>polluters and exploiters. Ecotage started around 1970 with
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The Fox” in Illinois, the “Billboard Bandits” in Michigan
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and the “Eco-Commandos” in Florida. These ecoteurs’ actions
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>have taken many forms—from the dramatic destruction of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>billboards and sugaring of bulldozer tanks to the simple
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>application of stickers reading, “BOYCOTT; this company
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>is a polluter.” They also advocate idealistic gestures such as
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sending memorial donations to ecology groups instead of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>cards and flowers to the deceased.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Ecotage seemed to originate in 1970 in Aurora, Illinois,
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>with a man calling himself “The Fox.” Taking his name from
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the polluted Fox River, he executed a series of well-planned
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>actions to expose the pollution of Kane County’s waters and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>countryside. He repeatedly plugged the illegal drains of soap
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>companies and capped their smoking chimneys. Pursued and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>shot at, the Fox persisted, sending notes to the media to call
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>attention to the polluters. He even appeared on a television
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>interview wearing a black mask. His most publicized action
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>was the presentation of the “Fox Foundation for Conserva
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tion Action Award,” given to the U.S. Steel Corporation.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>The prize was a 50-pound jar of foul, polluted sludge—a sam
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ple of water taken from Lake Michigan, where the company
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>dumped its refuse. The Fox poured the contents of this jar on
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the office carpet of a company executive. He commented,
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>“They keep saying that they aren’t really polluting our water.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>If that is true, then it shouldn’t hurt the rug, right?”2 By
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>his example, the Fox inspired a decade of ecoteurs.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Also in 1970, a series of actions was taken by a Miami
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>group calling themselves Eco-Commandos Force 70. A woman
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and five men celebrated Earth Day by staging raids on six
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>sewage plants that released dangerously high concentrates of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>pollutants in town waters. The method used was simple—at
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>night, dressed in black, they slipped past plant guards and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>threw a highly visible but harmless yellow dye into the sewage
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>holding tanks. The dye released its telltale color in a snakelike
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>trail, proving that the sewage purification treatment was not
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>only insufficient, but that the sewage lingered around the city.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>One of this group’s last direct actions was to motor about
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>two miles out into the Atlantic Ocean, where 40 million gal
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lons of raw sewage were pumped daily from Miami. Here they
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>released 700 drift bottles containing the message to finders:
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>“This is where the sewage goes.” Within 12 days, over 70 of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the bottled messages were returned from as far as 140 miles
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>away.3 The Eco-Commandos’ communiqués to the press docu
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>mented health hazard incidents, such as “swimmers bumping
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>into lumps of human feces, and revealed that pollution tests
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>were being conducted only during favorable tides and winds in

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>group, they faced only a trespassing charge. They maintained
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>anonymity and, according to a report by Peter Harnick in the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>book Ecotage, they are now rumored to be working within
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the system—preparing law suits, writing research reports and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>informing the public.

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>science. Ms. Magazine (November 1974) reported on Thelma
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>MacAdams of British Columbia, who noticed that a gas
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>masked pilot was spraying herbicide in her neighborhood.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Resulting bird deaths showed the substance to be toxic.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>MacAdams found a biochemist—Merriam Doucet—and to
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>gether they were able to stop the spraying by accruing infor
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>mation and sending protest letters to the newspapers. On
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>another occasion, when letters didn’t work and spraying was
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to be resumed, they called in neighborhood women, filled bal

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>as obstacles to the airplane. This imaginative ploy succeeded.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>In 1979, another spraying was protested by Joanne Rossell
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of Wolf Creek, Oregon. She enlisted neighborhood women to
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>act against the Bureau of Land Management, which had devel

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>plants (they actually “grew themselves to death”) although it
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>left intact the valuable Douglas fir seedlings. The women
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>suspected that this toxic substance would produce a similar
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>accelerated growth in animals and humans. People in heavily
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sprayed areas began to report headaches, dizziness and gastro
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>intestinal illnesses. Pregnant women experienced an abnor

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>point protesters took direct action to protect themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Pregnant women threatened to chain themselves to trees
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>while other activists camped and tethered balloons on target
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>sites.* Although the problem has not yet been resolved, the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>battle lines are drawn. Private citizens, particularly women, are

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Marlene Lakin, the Fund for Animals agent in Canada, has
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>led many active protests. Recently, in 1980, she organized a

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>for distributing anti-fur information. 3
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Lakin feels the issue is not whether or not animals are a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“renewable resource,” but that animals should not suffer or

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>vegetarian and to confront issues ranging from the factory
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>farming of animals to the mistreatment of circus animals.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Once, in attempting to hand out pamphlets exposing the cir

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Lakin was pushed in front of a moving car by a circus guard.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Although the guard was charged with assault, Lakin could not

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to Canada. 6
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>One group of animal rights champions has regularly ob

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>skins. In 1978, at the New York Coliseum, Bianca Beary and
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>her companion from the New York ASPCA discovered illegal
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>furs and turned in the owner, a West German. The coats were

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>vention. Yet Beary and her companion were also barred from
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the convention and had their passes taken away.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The following year another activist, Miss X, attended with
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>a companion. Their pockets were loaded with transparent cap
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sules—stink bombs. As they moved through the Coliseum,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>they unobtrusively dropped them on the floor, where they
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>were crushed underfoot by the crowd. Outside, animal rights
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>activists picketed with signs such as: “It took 137 animals&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>lives to make your fur coat.” The furriers came and went,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>suffering the jeers and chants with astonished looks (Doesn’t

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>A decidedly provocative gesture was made by Fay Funnell
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of Camberly, England. She bought an “on sale” mink coat,

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>gasoline and set it ablaze. Her comment was: “I hope mink

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>It was almost a dolphin declaration of war—a bloodless, futile

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>At dawn on February 28, 1980, Cate risked his life to

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and coaxed about half the dolphins to freedom. Threatened by

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>are clamped open and no anesthetic is used. Each rabbit is
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>observed for eye ulceration, hemorrhaging and cornea damage,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>all of which cause the animal extreme suffering. The nine-bil

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>performs endless new tests on animals. There are alternatives;
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>we can use fewer cosmetics or buy natural (not chemically

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>There have been many exemplary acts on behalf of the en

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>is probably because of the emphasis in our past on being
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>adylike, in combination with paternalistic indoctrination.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Still, a number of women have taken calculated risks and
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>found that moderate lawbreaking gets its point across, and

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>that plastic. Nor can I respect “the killer artist who videotaped

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>recently “rescued” from the local dog pound.15 The problem
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>continues. As recently as this spring, a French artist asked the

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>gadgets. We can also refuse to contribute to the exploitation of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>animals by not taking our children to the circus and rodeo. We
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>can stop buying “decorated” paper products (which aren’t as

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Thank you for such a marvelous, modern, convenient product. A sal
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ubrious contribution to humankind (and of course, quite secondarily,

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>with so many wonderful qualities, I&apos;d like to mention my favorites.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Obviously, one can&apos;t ignore the incredible fragrance emitted by

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>I enclose a rich array of colored shields, 14 in all.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The shields soak up the pigment evenly and without

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>shield. I did try to use it as a method
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>for attaching the shields to a studio wall,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>but when I tried to remove them the wall

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>states that land is to be “restored to the capability

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of 35 cents per ton of surface-mined coal. Based on

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The emergence of patriarchy was a crucial element in the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>formation of the state in Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica. This
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>factor is generally ignored in contemporary theories on the ori

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>omic class and political centralization accounts for the failure
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of current theories to solve the riddle of the rise of the state,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>characterized as “the most far-reaching political development
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in human history” (Carneiro, 1970:733). This omission
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>derives from the mainstream scholarly view that the inferior

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in societies paradoxically defined as “egalitarian.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>What need, then, to examine the role of the patriarchy in

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>archy are formed, thus avoiding the categorization of patri
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>archy as a universal and invariant structure. Thirdly, by show-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ing its development out of economic and political (public) in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>stitutions, we demonstrate that patriarchy is not rooted in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the family (private, domestic sphere) but is reflected in the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>family and reinforced by the process of socialization.

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Women were also preeminent in the class society of Minoan

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in procreation. During the late Aztec period the predominance
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of male gods was reinforced by the Spanish conquerors, who
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>projected their unmitigated patriarchal image of the world on
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the Aztec cosmology. Sumerian cosmology underwent similar

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>proportion of sixty to forty” (Fish, 1942-43:318). However,

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the water-god Enki” (Kramer, 1961:75).
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Initially “An was the sky seen as female” (Jacobsen, 1976:
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>137), which contradicts the notion that sky gods have always
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>been male. Then the power in the sky was seen “as both male

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>american cosmology at a similar socioeconomic stage. Then

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>eats the plants and the enraged Ninhursaga puts the curse of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>death upon him. He becomes very ill, “since as a male he was
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>not built to be pregnant” (bid.:113), and Enlil, the king of

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>in her vagina and gives birth to eight healing goddesses, who
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>are named for the various parts of Enki’s body where they
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>had developed. Although Enki was unsuccessful in this mythic
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>attempt to take over the female role in procreation, he was
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>acknowledged to be a participant in the process. Throughout

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>unity. Spanish priests and indigenous intellectuals trained in

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the equilibrium achieved between the dual forces. This has
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>continued in modern scholarship. Vaillant describes the ten

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The monumental stone image of Coatlicue, found in the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>central plaza of Tenochtitlan, is a female or androgynous
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>deity encompassing the entire Aztec cosmology, just as lnanna
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>encompassed that of Mesopotamia. The Spaniards referred to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>it as The Lady of the Snaky Skirt,” and treated it as a mother
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>earth symbol. But Justine Fernandez (1950:230) demonstrates
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that Coatlicue—the link between sky and earth, the mediator
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>between dry and wet regions-is an amalgam of various deities.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>both female and male. The skull over the umbilicus, paired

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>relate the image to Huitzilopochtli, god of war, and to Tona
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>tiuh, god of the sun or fertility.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>A subtle transmogrification occurs with Chantico, the god
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>dess of fire and water, whose name means &quot;inside the house&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>or &quot;the place where fire is,&quot; and also signifies the fiery chili
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>plant eaten at every meal and immediately after a fast. As a

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>from the liminal state to human existence. However, Seler
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>(1963:224) interpreted this as the eternal Eve seducing man
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>from holy ways as she delivered him over to temptation.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>The European notion of the earth as female and the sky
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>as male made it difficult for soldiers enculturated in that
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>tradition to recognize the sexual representations. The divine
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>pair, Ometecuhtli and Omecihuatl, creators of the world and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>of the other gods, were often reduced to Ometecuhtli, the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Lord of Duality, thus negating the androgynous essence of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Aztec cosmology. The moon was also both male and female.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>But translators of the Florentine Codex tried to overcome
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>their confusion by arbitrarily deciding to refer to the moon
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>as male alone, as it is in the fable of the rabbit and the moon.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>The 20 divine couples of the Codex Borgia bear witness to the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>duality of male and female representations; they are shown
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>eye to eye-a clear sign of equality with the status-conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Aztecs. Vaillant comments that the appearance of the female
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>deities seems “as if the idea of reproduction of male and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>female principles was dawning in Aztec theology” (1966:175).
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>It is more likely the final stage in the segmentation of andro

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Despite their loss of status in the iconography of state and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>empire, female deities and those associated with crops and rain
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>survived in the domestic and local pantheons. The three god

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>salt. Thus the subordination of female deities was specific to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>class, correlated with the male dominance of the elite ranks of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the military, nobility, priesthood and bureaucracy.

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>early Sumerian city-states” (Thomson, 1965). Women ruled
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>alone or with sometimes nameless consorts. Ku-Bau, a female
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>innkeeper, founded the Third Dynasty of Kish (c. 2500 B.C.)
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and became a legendary figure. Later queens shared their rule
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>with high priests who were their husbands. They sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>had their own courts and carried on long-distance trade in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>their own names. Queen Shagshag, married to Urukagina, was
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>also referred to as a goddess, though she was eventually sub
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ordinated through her husband’s law code (see below).
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>As warfare became predominant in Mesopotamia and Meso
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>america, women, continuing the Neolithic tradition, seemed to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>favor peaceful means to resolve conflicts, though initially they
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>also participated in defensive combat. The Sumerian myth
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Inanna Prefers the Farmer” may symbolize the tensions
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>between settled farmers and nomadic herders, whose raids
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>probably initiated warfare in the Middle East. Inanna chooses
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to give her hand to the conciliatory farmer Enkimdu rather
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>than to the bellicose shepherd Dumuzi, whom her brother the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sun god is urging on her. In other myths, Inanna is credited
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with a “warlike character and skill with weapons&quot; by which
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>she kills the dragon Kur (a feat later attributed to male gods);
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; she offers the hero “love ... and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>peace,&quot; both of which are rejected. By this time the kings of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Sumer were waging incessant war.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>In Mexico, warfare was endemic from around 800 A.D.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>until the Spaniards arrived, and women participated in combat
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>until at least the 11th century. Soustelle (1962) has inferred
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that “women had the supreme power in Tula”the Toltec
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>capital which led the prosperous and creative Golden Age of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Mexico from the 9th to the 12th centuries. Shortly before
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>their decline, the Toltecs became imperialistic and for the first
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>time in Mexico, fortified towns were necessary (Coe, 1977:
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>112). Their successors, the Aztecs, rejected “old fashioned
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>methods” like sorcery and magic to &quot;bring them glory and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>power” (Codex Ramirez; Séjourné, 1956:21) and the war

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>constant warfare, and the goddess of discord was created. A
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>striking example of this process was the transmogrification of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Civacoatl, goddess of earth and birth, “she who plants root
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>crops,&quot; often called “our mother”; she became “a presage of

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>In protohistorical Sumer, there were no goddesses of love.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Only in the later, militaristic period did Inanna become god
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>dess of love-and prostitution. Prostitutes in Sumer were at
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the bottom of the hierarchy of temple women. The warrior
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>king Gilgamesh (c. 2700 B.C., visited prostitutes—referred to as
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>virgins&quot;-in a brothel called the &quot;Family House,&quot; located in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the marketplace where women were bought and sold along
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with other commodities. Overlooking the economic gains the

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mentalized the &quot;profession&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The underlying idea must have been that of real devo
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tion, of sacrifice; the devotee gave to the service of the

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>prove, was no less precious to the Sumerian woman
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>than to others 1965:107).
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>But to what idea were these women devoted? Why were they
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>called upon to &quot;sacrifice”? Why their virginity? Since virginity
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was of no greater value to women than to men in egalitarian
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>societies, it must have become &quot;precious” to Sumerian women
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>when they became commodities.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>In the later Aztec state, the link between prostitution and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>militarism was marked. Boys attending military training school
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>routinely visited the “house of singing and revelry, where
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they were encouraged to indulge in sex. Men who took prison
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ers in war received a share of the tribute and gained entry into
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the war councils; women were part of the booty shared by the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>victors. Male sexual aggression toward women is symbolized
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in the figure from the Codex Borgia, which shows the dual

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>hands of an increasingly male ruling class. In Sumer, the fourth

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>epic tale, took its place beside the myth. In the epic,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>man, represented by the ruler, is the hero, and the tale
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>celebrates his prowess and his cleverness, even to the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>point of challenging the authority of the gods (Jacob
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>sen, 1976:79).
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Meanwhile, the female deities were not only challenged, but
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>eventually subordinated.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>According to Jacobsen (1970:164), Sumerian mythology is
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>based in historical events. The assembly of the female and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>male gods, in which Inanna speaks with as much wisdom and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>authority as the male gods, reflects the democratic assembly of

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>women and men. Ad hoc temporary kings were elected to deal
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with wars of limited duration, and at this stage rape was still
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>considered a heinous crime, punishable by exile, even for a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>king. This is reflected in the tale of Enlil, who rapes the pre
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pubescent goddess Ninlil and is banished to the nether world:
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The lord speaks to her of intercourse; she is unwilling; my

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>too small, they know not to kiss” (Kramer, 1963:146).
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>By c. 2700 B.C., the assembly of Uruk consisted only of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>men—the basic step in the breakdown of the democratic pro
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cess. Moreover, Gilgamesh was no longer elected, but ruled
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>by “divine appointment,” and could overrule the assembly&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>vote against war. His right of sexual access to every woman&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>body demonstrated his power over men as well as women
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>(Mason, 1970:15). Not only was this “epic hero” a rapist
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and a tyrant, but he grossly insulted Inanna, his matron deity
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>(by then demoted to goddess of prostitutes).
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>By the end of the third millennium B.C., “the king had
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>become the sole and absolute ruler of the land” (Kramer,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>1969:12). The Enuma Elish-the Babylonian epic of creation
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>composed during the latter half of the second millennium B.C.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and performed at the New Year festival every year for nearly
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>two thousand years-shows that before the king could assume
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>absolute power, women had to be totally subjugated. In it the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>assembly asks the god Marduk to destroy the goddess Tiamat-
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the original progenitor and creator of all, once equated, like
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Nammu, with the primeval sea, but now associated with
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>inertia, chaos and anarchy, opposed to the emerging forces of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>activity and order. Marduk ridicules the gods’ fear of Tiamat:
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;What hero has forced battle on you? Only a female thing&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>(Sanders, 1971:30). With military technology in male hands,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Marduk defeats Tiamat “not because he is stronger, but
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>because he is better armed&quot; (bid.:21). This is undoubtedly
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the first historical use of the equation “woman is to man as
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>nature is to culture,&quot; the ideology that rationalizes the subor

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>based on class.

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>n.d.). The “flowery wars” to “acquire the hearts of captives,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to feed the sun and keep it in motion,” were used to validate
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the predatory search for tribute and loot. The hierarchical

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>royal council at Tenochtitlan. Led by the war god Huitzilo
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>pochtli, the council had the sacred mission of bringing all
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>nations into the service of the sun. As the Aztecs drenched the

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>total power as law-maker when he defeated Tiamat. Laws
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>were codified when a state had the coercive means to enforce
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>them. Thus Urukagina’s Code, enacted after he defeated
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Lugalanda as high priest of Lugash, protected the property
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of the ruling elite. By regulating status and behavior in the

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>One of Urukagina’s regulations imposed monogamy on
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>women only, creating the new crime of adultery, punishable
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>by death. The regulation noted that women “used to take two
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>husbands,” indicating that in the recent past property was still
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>owned communally by matrilineal clans. The identity of the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>biological father was not considered necessary until it affected
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the accumulation and transmission to children of private pro

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>institutionalized patrilineal inheritance and descent, patrilocal
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>residence and the patriarchal family. Another decree in Uru
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>kagina’s Code stated that:
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The woman who has sinned by saying something to a

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>This legalized woman-beating and helped enforce the mono
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>gamy regulation. The draconian penalties surely indicate
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the strength of women’s resistance to these decrees.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>It is a startling fact that Sumerologists and students of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ancient laws fail to deal with the impact of these regulations
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>on women. Kramer, for example, praises the Code as “one of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the most precious and revealing documents in the history of

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>from tyranny” (Ibid.:79). In. fact, the Middle Eastern laws
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>became increasingly repressive toward women, as well as to

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Sumerian laws, Hammurabi’s Code, enacted about 1750 B.C.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>in the name of the war god Marduk, tended to exact severer

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ness of the family tie” (1965:92). For example, a wife who
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>&quot;sets her face to go out of doors and persists in behaving her
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>self foolishly, wasting her house and belittling her husband,

			<pb n='67'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>could be divorced without receiving divorce money; or her

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>could be thrown into the river (Driver and Miles, 1955:81).
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The later Assyrian laws were even more repressive.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>In Mexico, Nezahualcoyotl, crowned ruler of Texcoco in
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>1431, codified 80 laws that were crucial in centralizing power
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and consolidating the empire. He elaborated regulations
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>against drunkenness and adultery to provide different punish

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>an early plot against Samoza (1954).
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Daisy went to the university in Managua
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in 1967, studying psychology and writ-

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>My comrade always worked as an
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>engineer. I had a job doing translations
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>for a magazine and worked voluntarily
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mounting exhibitions for Nicaraguan
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>painters. My work for the Organization
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was limited mainly to cover tasks: trans
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ports, errands and the safehouse. The
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>comrade responsible for us here in Man
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>agua was Oscar Pérez Cassar—now dead.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Dionisio and l also participated in sever
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>al operations around that time.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Look, 1 think this is something that
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>has to be talked about. The people like
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>us who were taking part in Managua
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>around that time: we were all legal
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cadre. The men were mostly profes
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sionals, sometimes the women as well.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>And ! began to feel a kind of discrimina
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tion. At the meetings ! began to talk
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>about the dissatisfaction ! felt with my
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>level of participation. ! spokè about this
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with other women involved, but in gen
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>eral it didn’t seem that they felt the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>same as 1 did. ! don&apos;t think this dis
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>crimination came from my being a
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>woman as much as from my class back
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ground. Maybe it was because of my
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>social class that they didn&apos;t trust me
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with other kinds of work, with another
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>kind of role.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>remember talking a lot about this
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>with Dora María at the time. (Dora
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Maria Téllez is now Commander and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Vice-President of the Council of State.)
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>l&apos;d often tell her that it was hard for
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>me to get over a kind of inferiority com
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>plex 1 felt with the comrades who came
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to my house, in terms of my class back
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ground. 1 was clear on the role the petty
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>bourgeoisie was called upon to play in
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the development of the revolutionary
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>process, but I was also clear about the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>fact that that role didn’t satisfy me.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>wanted more participation, and on a
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>different level. And it wasn’t really until
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>left home completely, threw myself
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>into the struggle full-time and went to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>fight alongside the other comrades,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that I was able to totally overcome that
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>feeling.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>One of our comrades had managed to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>introduce a scanner into the country
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and so we were able to intercept all the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Guard’s radio communications. They
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>spoke in code, but it was a pretty simple
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>code. And we were able to break it and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>understand everything they were saying.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>So part of my job at that time was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sitting by that scanner, listening to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>everything the Guard said. That’s how
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>we found out about their operations be
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>fore they carried them out—if they were
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>heading for one of our comrades’ houses,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>if they were going to set roadblocks up
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>on the highway. We also had an arsenal
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of weaponry at our house-submachine
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>guns, rockets, dynamite—in a room we
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>called “the toy room.” So that was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>more or less what I was doing then: lis
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tening to the scanner, keeping a safe
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>house, keeping arms—purely operative
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tasks.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>1 had to break with all that, by going
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to fight.

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>San Carlos, Masaya and Granada in
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>1977. We were preparing for the final
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>insurrection. . It was during this time
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>that we also began to plan the attack on
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the National Palace. We made a thor

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>got the uniforms, the resources; we
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>bought the trucks; we were able to ob

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>representatives made, and we got photos
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>of the most important ones so that the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>members of the commando could be

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Just imagine the difficulties of hous
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ing the entire commando. It was a large
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>group and almost everyone involved was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>taking part in this kind of an operation
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>for the first time. The comrades came to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>my house on a weekend. They arrived
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>one by one. We had lined the windows
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with paper. We distributed all the com
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rades in three rooms, and all this made
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for a food problem as well. We went to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a nearby Chinese restaurant and bought
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>take-out dinners three times a day for
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>everyone. The comrades couldn’t move
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>or talk much, because the house had to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>keep its appearance of a normal family
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>dwelling. Shortly before the operation
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>itself, Hugo Torres went to another
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>house, where the other half of the com

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Pastora and 14 others remained with
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>We lived on the Southern Highway.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>We pretended to close the house up, as
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>if Dionisio and I had gone away for the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>weekend, so that if someóne came
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>looking for us and didn’t find anyone
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>they wouldn’t think it strange. The
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>comrades had to keep their voices down
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>at all times and be on the alert for
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>strange noises, anyone who might drive
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>up. I remember one of the countless
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>incidents was when a sister of mine
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>came to visit with a friend, and it hap
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>pened that she saw me through a win-
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>dow. And since I knew she had seen
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>me, 1 had to come out. She kept asking
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>me what the matter was. She said she
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>thought something seemed strange. And
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>had to invent a whole story about
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>having stained the floor with something
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and that just as lheard her knocking!
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>had been going to get something to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>clean it with. It was a double life
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and at times it was hard to manage,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>right? Especially with the repression
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>which was really heavy by then.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>On the day of the attack—the 22nd
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Dionisio was to call Dora Maria and con
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>firm the fact that everything was ready

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Edén. The comrades began to get ready;
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>they put their uniforms on. Up to the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>very last minute the members of the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>commando didn’t know what the objec
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>tive was, they only knew it was going to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>be an important operation. So when
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>everyone was ready, they all filed out
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and sat down on a row of benches l had
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>in the garden there, and we began the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>explanation. We put up a map, and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Edén began to explain the action in
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>detail. We passed out files to everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>too, with photos of the representatives,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>and we told them to memorize the most

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>important ones: Luis Pallais, Irma Guer

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>people. It wasn’t until then that the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>comrades really understood the magni
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tude of the operation planned.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Then Polo came with the truck.1
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>often think that if the Guard had been
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a little smarter they would have seen
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that the truck was a fake. We had
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>painted it at a movement garage and we

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>it should have been. And then we built
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a frame in back and we had to tie a
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>canvas we’d bought at a sporting goods
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>store over the frame and secure it on
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>both sides and in back. But when we
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>went to tie this canvas down, we sud-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>denly realized the frame was too high
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and there was a space on either side
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>between the bottom of the canvas and
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the truck bed. All the comrades would
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>be visible! Just then I remembered that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>in the “toy room” 1 had some boards.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Two of them turned out to be just the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>size we needed; we rushed to nail them
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>into place.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>When everything was ready, 1 was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>supposed to give the order to set out.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>But just then the woman next door
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>decided to go out and water her plants!
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Imagine, the truck was hidden behind
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the house, and we didn’t want there to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>be any witnesses to its driving off. But
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the woman just wouldn’t budge, and
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>finally 1 had to give the departure order
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>anyway. And the truck set off.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>went right away to the scanner to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>try to follow the operation through the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Guard’s communications, and be able to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>know if everything went as planned.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Later Dionisio told me that around
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>11:30 he was too excited and-he left
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>work and went to the plaza, where he
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>parked his car and saw the trucks drive
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>up. He saw them park, he saw the com-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>rades getting out and getting into a per
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>fect military formation, and he saw
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>them entering the palace in perfect
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>order. When the last comrade had dis
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>appeared inside those doors, he returned
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>to work. He knew the operation would
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>be a success.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>For my part, I stayed glued to the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>scanner. There was a moment when the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Guard was completely disoriented. They
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>began to say, “There’s a shoot-out over
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>at the Communications Palace. When
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>heard that, I was confused, because
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>thought maybe they’d been stopped
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>along the way and hadn’t been able to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>reach their objective. The Communica

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>part of the guard who was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>talking. He was nervous, I guess, and
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>then he corrected himself. He said no,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that the shoot-out was at the National
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Palace. And 1 heard them saying: “Care
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ful, they’re dressed like EEBl” the In
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>fantry Basic Training School, a kind of

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>against the revolutionaries. That’s
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>when I realized the commando had ar
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>rived all right, and that the operation
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was going to work.

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Then, in September, it seemed the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>time was ripe for the insurrection. We
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>had instructions to form a squadron
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>from the same support network that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>had functioned for the previous actions.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>There were ten men. 1 had been training
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>with them the whole time, and 1 insisted
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>on going with them. For me it was an
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>absolute necessity, and the only way of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>overcoming the problems I mentioned
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>before.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>It was decided that 13 squadrons
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>would simultaneously attack each of the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>city’s 13 police stations, later regroup
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ing in order to carry out further actions.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Not until the very last minute, when the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>attack plan was being drawn up, was it
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>decided whether or not 1 would be in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>cluded. I had convinced my comrade,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Dionisio, and he agreed that 1 should
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>come along. But it had to be a collec
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>tive decision. So I told the comrades
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>that I was determined to go, that I had
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>participated in all the tasks assigned to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>me up to that point, that I thought!
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>had shown sufficient discipline and that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>didn’t see any reason at all for them to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>leave me behind. They agreed.

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Another comrade and I had to jump out
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>and cover the highway at the moment

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>police stations were coordinated for six
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sharp. We went into action exactly
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>at six. But our preparation had been
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>pretty rudimentary in many ways.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>There was a lot of confusion at first and
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a bit of chaos. The 11 of us had num
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bers from zero to ten. I was “number
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>7.” We planned on destroying the sta
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tion in ten minutes, and in fact we
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were able to burn it to the ground in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>seven. When we were getting back into
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the cars, the station was a mass of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>flames.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Two things stand out in my mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>One is the solidarity of an old man who
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>just happened to be nearby. One of the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>commando members was wounded in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the arm, and suddenly I saw this old
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>man waving to me, waving a handker-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>chief. I could see him from where 1
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was positioned behind a wall. Imagine,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>there we were and he stood up to wave
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>at me, and I crossed over and took the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>handkerchief and was able to bandage
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the comrade’s arm. I can’t forget that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>gesture, that old man risking his life at
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>a time like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>The other was at the end. The opera
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tion was a success, but we didn’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>there was an EEBI barracks near there.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>It was an error on our part, a lack of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>information we should have had to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>begin with. And the guards came out
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of their barracks, crossed the highway
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and began to take their positions. The
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>comrade in charge of our squadron told
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Dionisio to cover our retreat, that we’d
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>have to try to get to some houses
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>around there. Dionisio was firing from
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>behind our car and I was in several dif
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ferent spots: first near one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>houses, then behind a small wall. I rem
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ember at one point running into Dionisio
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and asking him what he thought our
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>chances of escape were. And he said,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Look, forget it. There’s no way out
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of this. We’re surrounded. I don’t see
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>how we can break the circle they’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>thrown around us, so be prepared to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>die. We calculated between 150 and
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>200 guards in all.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>So that’s just what we did: prepare
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>to die. We tried to save as much ammun
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ition as we could, defending our posi
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>tions and waiting for them to move in
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>and finish us off. Maybe it was the other
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>attacks, in other parts of Managua, that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>saved us there. Because if ours had been
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>an isolated action, I don’t think we
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>could have escaped. But it seems that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the Guard was disoriented. We began
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>hearing their commander telling them to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>advance, but they didn’t advance. We
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>could hear gunfire over by San Judas
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>the attack spot nearest us—and we real

			<pb n='72'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ized that battles were taking place in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>different parts of the city.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>remember all of a sudden we began
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>shouting out our numbers: we had in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>structions that in case we found our
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>selves scattered, we should shout our
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>numbers so we could know how many
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of us were still alive. I listened to the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>numbers and I shouted out “7,” and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>thought there were only four or five of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>us still alive. And then 1 began hearing
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>64,” “65,” numbers that 1 knew didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>exist. And I realized it was a tactic to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>confuse the Guard, so they wouldn’t be
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>able to figure out how many of us there
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>really were.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>don’t know why, but suddenly
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>there seemed to be a sort of truce.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wasn’t hearing shots anymore. And we
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>began to shout out our numbers again
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and began coming together in a small
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>rocky area. There were five of us. We

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>began to try to figure out what to do
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and we came to the conclusion that the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>only thing we could do would be to try
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to join up with the comrades over at
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>San Judas. We tried to make our way
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>through a hilly area behind us. The trail
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>was practically vertical, and very diffi
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cult. We spent all night trying to get
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>through that way. At one point we
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>came close to some houses but a couple
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of dogs smelled us coming about a kilo
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>meter away, and every time we moved
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>to get closer, those dogs began to bark.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>We finally had to keep still and not
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>move any further that night. 1 remem
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ber there was a beautiful moon, and for
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the first time ! cursed the moon because
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>it was almost like daylight. One of the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Guard&apos;s helicopters passed overhead,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>but they didn&apos;t see us.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>That night we were all exhausted.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>We had to decide who was going to do
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the first guard post, and 1 offered.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>spent the whole night awake and when
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>saw that it was getting light, 1 woke up
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the rest of the comrades and suggested
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>try to go out to the highway. Being a
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>woman, 1 thought 1 might be able to say
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>had been caught in the middle of the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>previous night&apos;s battle, and they might
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>believe me. Then 1 could go for help.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>We had a short discussion about that.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>The comrades claimed that it was ob
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>vious 1 had taken part in the battle
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>we were all wearing dark pants and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>shirts, with a colored ribbon-a differ
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ent color for each day—so no one would
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>be able to infiltrate us (we were the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>only ones who knew which color was
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>for which day). We carried a small knap
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>sack with first-aid items, the colored
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>ribbons and some red and black necker
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>chiefs we were going to distribute
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>among the rest of the comrades when
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>we joined up with them. What held me
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>back a bit was the blood I had all over
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>my clothing-because of having ban
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>daged that comrade’s arm. Since I had
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>crawled along the ground, the blood and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>earth and all was a single mass of dark
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>stains, and I said it didn’t matter. But
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the others said it did, that with labora
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tory tests they could easily tell 1 had
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>blood on my clothing. In short ...
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was firm in my decision to try to go
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>for help, but Dionisio said he wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>let me go alone. He said he’d come
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with me, and we could pretend we
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>were a couple who had been trapped
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>there. It sounds ridiculous, but that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>what we ended up doing.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>We began to walk, and of course
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the dogs began to bark. I didn’t let
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>them stop me, I went up to the first
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>house, someone looked out andI
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>made signs that we needed help. But
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>he told us to get out. At the next house
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the same thing happened: the people
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>went inside and closed the door.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Dionisio said we shouldn’t try any-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>more, that it was dangerous because
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>those people might turn us in. But
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>then I saw a little house where a family
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of caretakers lived, peasants who
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>watched over one of those estates.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Dionisio called out to an old man, we
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>told him the story of our being trapped
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>in the battle, and he said: Sure, friend,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that was a terrible battle all right.&quot; And
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>he told us to come on in. Poor as those
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>people were, they did everything they
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>could for us. We told them we had
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>some friends who had also been caught
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>in the same place. think those people
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>knew who we were; we were all
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>scratched up, covered with mud, filthy.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>But they pretended to believe our story.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>They told us to go get the others.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Then one of the young women—the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>old man&apos;s daughter-in-law-came up to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>me and asked what had happened.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>could see that they didn’t really believe
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>our story, but they wanted to help us.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>So 1 told her the truth, that we were the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ones in the battle the night before, and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>that ! needed her to help me, to let me
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>wash and lend me a change of clothing
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>so1 could go out on the highway and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>look for help. She began to cry and said
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>of course. She and another young girl
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>got out their best things. 1 remember
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>they gave me a yellow blouse, a pair of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>tan pants and red tennis shoes. And
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>they brought me a cup of coffee.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>cried, and every time 1 think of those
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>people 1 cry: their attitude, risking their
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>lives to help us.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>When the rest of the comrades came,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was totally transformed! I insisted on
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the idea of my going out on the high
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>way, but Dionisio kept saying he didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>want me to go alone. Because of my
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>physical appearance, we thought
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>might be able to pass for a foreigner.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Finally another one of the comrades
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>blond, with blue eyes—who could also
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>pass for a foreigner, went with me. One
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of the sons of that peasant family took
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>us as far as one of the nearby estates,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and from there we made our way out
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>onto the highway. I spoke English and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the comrade spoke German, and we just
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>walked right past the guards—who were
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>spread all over the asphalt—me speaking
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>English and the comrade answering me
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in German, saying whatever came into
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>our heads. And we managed to get
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>through....
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>When the war ended and I returned
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to Managua, one of the first things I did
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was to visit the peasant family that had
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>taken us in that night. They were happy
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to see me and they gave me a huge sack
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of green mangos. But the young woman
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wasn’t there, the one who had helped
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>me change clothes.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>In Jinotepe, a few days after the tri
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>umph, there was a tribute to Arlen
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Siu. I had to speak. I had only spoken
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>before that for Radio Sandino, and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>was nervous about speaking in public.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>When 1 finished, 1 saw someone coming
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>toward the stage, from out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>crowd, and 1 heard her say: &quot;It’s her...
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>It&apos;s her.&quot;1 leaned down, and at first
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>didn’t know who it was. But she said,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Don’t you remember me? You came
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>to my house one night, and 1 gave you
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>clothing.&quot; She was with her mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>And she told me, &quot;Take off your glas-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ses&quot;— was wearing dark glasses-and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>she said to her mother, See, Mama,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>told you, look at how pretty her eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>are.&quot; She gave me a big hug, she was so
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>glad to see me. And she asked me if
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>we’d all managed to come out all right.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>was able to tell her we were all alive.

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2341_tl_32' n='N032'/>ANH: If you have two boys and two girls you are lucky. This
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2341_tl_33' n='N033'/>is a good number. Also your neighbors think you must be
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2341_tl_34' n='N034'/>lucky (wealthy) to be able to feed so many. People who are

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>man would not make his mother take care of his children. The

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Anh, if you have children do you want to have boys or girls?
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ANH: I hope it’s a boy.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Why:
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ANH: Because I wish I was a boy. I remember when I was
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>little, my elder brother and the neighbors’ son were playing on
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the ground with little pebbles. I wanted to join them but they
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>said no, they wouldn’t let her, because that was not for girls.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Other times when she was feeling very happy and glad, she
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>would forget herself and run around and make lots of noise
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and act happy and her father would shake his head with
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>disapproval and talk to her mother and say he had never seen
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>such a girl and her mother should tell her to be more sophis
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ticated and ladylike.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Because at that time my young heart or little mind, the
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>beginning forming of ideas, took for my model the little boy.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>As time went on, the inconvenience of the woman, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>bothers of childbearing and the pain of it... it is the path of a
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>woman. I don’t think this means l’m in any way psychologi-
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cally abnormal or weird, or queer. l’m just talking about my
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>hope and my idealism, and my wish. But god of fate says
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>this is what you’re going to be, this is the part you’re going to
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>play, so 1 think that we should take the challenge bravely.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>And why did you want to be a boy?
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ANH: If 1 was a boy l’d feel very free and could do some
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>things I want.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>What do you want to do?
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ANH: I could leave my family and live alone.

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ANH: Well, some people think children are like a souvenit
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>showing the love, like a trophy of that. Everybody wants to

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>it reflects you, reflects your youthful times. I hope 1 can have
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>two children, but I want them both to be sons. Because then,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>besides their parents, their mother and father and friends, they
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>won’t be lonely because they will have a brother to talk to.

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>son, the name is gone
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Why do people want the name to continue?

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of their murderers. The captain, John Davis, the most skilled

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In 1823, Samuel Newhouse invented the leg-hold trap.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Since then, it has accounted for the painful death of billions
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of animals and the maiming of millions more. The leg-hold
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>trap is a simple device consisting of two spring-loaded stee
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>“jaws” with a pan to hold the bait in the center. When an ani
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>mal steps forward to get the bait, its paw is caught between
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the jaws. The more the animal (or human) pulls away, the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tighter the jaws grip. In what trappers refer to as the “wring

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>traps as “trash.” It is estimated that seven out of every ten
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>animals trapped are unwanted.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Should an animal escape from a trap, the chances are it will

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>animals die of thirst, starvation or exposure. Others are sitting

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>state as to how often a trapper must check the traps, these
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>laws are practically unenforceable. Moreover, there are no law.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>governing how the trapper should kill the animal. Many trap
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>pers are unwilling to “waste a bullet” and choose a cheaper
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>method of killing, such as bludgeoning.

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>when children between the ages of 12 and 16 check their traps
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and find a live animal, they are practically forced to destroy it
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>with the crudest means available because they are not allowed
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to carry firearms (except when accompanied by an adult). If a

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>scale cruelty to animals is practiced by the food industry.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Some 150 million mammals and 3 billion birds are slaughtered
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>annually in the Unitéd States. In addition to being killed in

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>living conditions. They are confined in cages too small to allow

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>four to five birds. These cages have sloping wire mesh floors
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and range in size from 12 by 12 inches to 18 by 20 inches.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Typically, a single layer house contains 90,000 hens arranged

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>duction is stimulated by “force molting” of the flocks—stop
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ping food and water and cutting back the hours of light. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>birds die of shock from this procedure, but the increased egg

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>were not removed. A hot-knife machine is used to remove
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>half of the upper and lower beak. As thousands of birds are
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>quickly sent through this machine, inevitably many of the

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tised). This is done by restraining the calves in stalls only
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>slightly larger than their bodies to prevent the animals from
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>using their muscles. They are fed only a high-fat artificial milk
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to keep the flesh pale. The deprivation of iron weakens the

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Hog farmers are also increasingly turning to factory farming

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>after birth and placed in individual wire cages, where they are
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fed with automatic nipples. After that, they are sent to fin

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the severe overcrowding produces considerable stress: the pigs
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>begin to bite their ears and tails. These stress symptoms are
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>controlled with drugs and by cutting off the pigs’ tails.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_10_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Who is to blame for these practices? How can they be al

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ets. My Mother “keeps” everything. One year, 1 found two
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>small books, Texas school textbooks that I had read as a child.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The one l use in these drawings is called In Animal Land, by
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Mabel Guinnip La Rue, printed in 1928. Mother is a school
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>teacher; she first taught school in a seven-grade, one-room
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>schoolhouse in “the country.” She was the teacher and Daddy
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was the principal when they first married, and this book may
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>have come from there, or from my own grade school at a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>much later date. In Texas, old books and classical books seem
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to stay around. (By classics, I mean Greek and Norse classics,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>a formal sense about learning, the country habit of capitalizing
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>important words, the use of Greek and Roman given names
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>like Augustus, etc.) This book has a particular flavor to me as
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>an object. Its cover is ripped down to the cardboard, the pages
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>are torn and passionately scribbled over by a child (or children,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and big words are printed over the little typed words of the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pages—words as physical objects. I remember the importance
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of the choice of tablets when we learned to write. I liked to
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>use “Big Chief” tablets; their covers were pale red, like merth-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>iolate, with red lines. My other favorite tablets had photos of
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Esther Williams, Dale Evans or Trigger on their covers. The
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>pictures remind me of a game the girls played, “horses.” We
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>would whinny and run in a herd at school recess; this was
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>strictly a girls’ game.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>But to return to the book, it has the physical presence l
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>describe. I feel a sense of recognition—not memory, but plea
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sure and attachment—when I turn to specific stories in the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>book. It is one of these pictures and pages I chose to use in my
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>drawings. The story has a particular appeal. It is called “Play
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>mate. It is a retelling, with what 1 believe to be an American
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>twist, of the Cinderella story.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>1heard a lot of fairy tales as a child. I believe fairy tales
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>are told mostly to girls and mostly interest girls for two rea
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sons: they prepare us for the idea of a prince, and make him
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>particularly desirable; they give us a sense of our own potential
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>magical powers. For example, Snow White, Cinderella and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Rapunzel are special girls who have gone unrecognized, the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>way many girl children feel. While they all get power in the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>end through a (worldly) alliance with a prince who saves them
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from poverty or stasis, he needs them because they are allied
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>with magic earth-powers, and this is one way a girl can think
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of herself.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>In my childhood, I played a lot of games with insects and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>animals which reinforced my feelings of “magical connection’
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to the earth. These games were encouraged by my Mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Among them were: making homes for ladybugs, collecting
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>brown bees, catching turtles, playing with doodle bugs (stick
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ing a twig in a doodle bug hole until the doodle bug came
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>out, a game played in Florida too), pulling bag worms off
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>cedar bushes (pushing the end of the bag until the worm came
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>out), giving water to baby horned toads in bottle caps. Mother
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>played the role of releasing the captives during the night (al
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>though once she forgot to release the bees, and they died).
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Some of these games helped the adults (the bag worms were
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>killing the cedar bushes); some of them made us feel like care-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>takers or domesticators of small wildlife. We also had games
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with caterpillars and I was allowed to dress my cats in doll
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>clothes. These were games I played alone, or with my sister. As
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for boys’ games, we knew of boys who pulled legs off June
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>bugs, and boys also threw June bugs at girls. Both boys and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>girls played mud pies
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>What seems American to me in this story—“Playmate”—is
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the woods it describes. The fairy tales 1 heard were mostly
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>from Germany (Grimms). The German woods were destroyed
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a long time ago. Rachel Carson mentions in Silent Spring that
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>almost all the present-day European forests are replanted ones.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>We still have some of our original forest. In rereading Cinder
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ella, 1 realized how few of the grisly parts I had remembered
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The details 1 had forgotten are all physical ones: Cinderella’s
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>magical powers come from her dead Mother’s grave. She weeps
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>for her, and this physical watering of the earth which contains
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>her Mother allows the twig, from her Father, to grow into a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>magical tree. It’s a complicated image—literally, Mother Earth
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>coupling with Father Twig-and the daughter who hasn’t for
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>gotten her Mother gets clothing from this, the magical dresses
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>she wears. The images are enclosing. Instead of the flight from
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the body that is learned in Christianity—Christ rises from the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>grave, Christ overcomes his body—the Mother stays in the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ground; her intercession with the earth encloses her daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in clothes that are elaborate, jewelled (rocks, metallic threads),
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and lead to sexual union. The clothes are also clues for the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>man (Prince). They define her for him. (He knows she is there,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>but he doesn’t know who she is without her slipper.) It’s al-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>most a parody for the present—the object versus the person.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Our clothes still “symbolize” us. (My Mother used to say she
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>wanted me to “look like a lady, because she came out of a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>farm culture where the women did most of the hard work;
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>women can move “up” in class and assume the class of their
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>husbands.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>In the drawings, I reproduce a picture of little Playmate,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>clothed in her “magical” clothes, the living animals. This is a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>little girl who gets along well with the animals in the forest.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Like Cinderella, she is poor, but her parents are poor too.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>They are a disenfranchised class. The early history of North
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>America (for Europeans) romanticized the woodsman. These
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>people cleared the forests; they planted crops. My own Grand
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>father had been a logger in Oklahoma. There’s a photo of him
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>driving the last mule team, his wagon filled with logs and the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>woods depleted, out of this particular piece of forest. When we
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>were children, my sister and I played on that wagon; it had a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>huge wooden tongue. Now his farm is gone too, sold to ran
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>chers, and the land is used for grazing. This is recent history,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>recent enough for there to be a guilty conscience. If the farmer
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>is gone, you tell stories about the farmer; if the Indians are
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>killed, you make statues of them on public buildings in big
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>cities; if the buffalo is gone, he lives on a coin; if the animals
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>are killed and the woods are cut down, they become toys and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>fairy stories. In this culture, a fairy story is another way of
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>saying someone is lying. It is also a way to keep something
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>that is recent enough to remember. In the cities, we dress as
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>all the recent cultural myths—the worker, the cowboy, the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>railroad man, the Indian.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>Playmate’s dress is a wishful one. Because the animals love
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_7_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>her, they clothe her with their living bodies—bird hat, leaf

			<pb n='85'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>skirt, fox muff—and the animal who directs all this is the bear.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>The bear is one of the central American animals. It can stand
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>up like we can, and it dwarfs us. It lives where we cannot live,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>deep in caves—earth holes, holes inside mountains. Its habits
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>give it fetal associations, as it returns to dormancy for a period
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in a womb/cave, then reemerges. We cannot do that (though
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>some of us have “dens”). But we can take little bear-replicas to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sleep with us during childhood, and part of their appropriate
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ness may come from the bear’s hibernation. (1 had a brown
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>bear named Jimmy whose yellow muzzle 1 kissed off as a
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>child, leaving a distinguished straw mouth where the little red
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tongue had been.) The toy bear’s name, “teddy bear,” comes
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>from the hunter and conservationist Teddy (Theodore) Roose
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>velt. Playmate’s Bear may replace Cinderella’s Mother in this
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tale. It shows how much we women have lost, in terms of asso
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ciation. In the old tale, life is hard, cruel even, and matter-of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>fact. The Stepmother can counsel her natural daughters to cut
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>off a heel or a toe, because “you won’t need to walk” when
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;you marry the Prince.” Cinderella is openly pushed out; if
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>there is only room for two, the third won’t have any. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>European coming here expected to reverse those rules; he/she
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>wanted to wear the fox muff and have the fox too. (“We had
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to destroy the village to save it.”) In this story, there is clo
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>thing without violence. In fact, we live from the earth. Vege-
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>table fiber (clothes, cotton), animal skin (leather), meat, all
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>food and clothing involve some being’s sacrifice. Without that
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>recognition, there can be no sense of obligation.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>And there is little Playmate herself, hoping to get adopted
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>by the Prince. She is a childish model for the more recent
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;Playmate” centerfold, herself a “rabbit,” the staple food of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>bigger animals, who has the sort of amiability the animals exhi
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>bit in this story. Like the animals, she needs no additional
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>clothing. To have no clothing means to have no protection.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Let us go backwards in our tale, symbolically. Mabel Gun
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>nip La Rue rewrote “Cinderella” to make the tale more palpa-
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ble. I learned to read with some of these books. Like all chil
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>dren, 1 approached the words physically, like actual things,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and I marked and tore at the book. As an adult, I can reclaim
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the pictures and make changes in them, and as women, we can
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>reclothe ourselves. In practical ways, we can keep a sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>reciprocity about what we take from the earth—animals need
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>their own clothes; clothes made out of good cloth can be
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>taken apart, resewn, given away or bought second-hand. We
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>can reuse the traditional female skills-plant sharing and gar
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dening, housekeeping, sewing, all the maintenance jobs women
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>perform-on a broader public scale, to garden in the city or to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>stop nuclear power and the spread of pollutants. We can also
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>use our “clothes,” this time for a different end—not to gain
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>admittance to the Prince’s castle, making it bearable for him to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>live apart from Nature through our presence. We should stay

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>poets, whose great achievement was a “peculiar blend of pas

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>beginning to recover. This unified consciousness expresses
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>itself in metaphor, conceit or paradox, and is thus a suitable
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>expression for the articulation of a truly radical feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>theory. Both Susan Griffin (in Woman and Nature) and Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Daly (in Gyn/Ecology) combine theory with poetic language,

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>theory that does not artificially separate personal, political
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and metaphysical concerns, but presents them as various
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>dimensions of a single, unified reality.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Many serious works of feminist theory also appear in the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>guise of fantasy literature. I focus here on three contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>feminist utopian science fictions: Dorothy Bryant’s The Kin
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>of Ata Are Waiting for You, Marge Piercy’s Woman on the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Edge of Time and Mary Staton’s From the Legend of Biel.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>These novels unselfconsciously express political theory in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>poetic, “metaphysical” language.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>An advantage of fantasy literature for asking fundamental
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>questions about the basic assumptions of our culture is its
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>freedom from conventional ideas of reason or possibility.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>These novels posit social institutions and cultural modes based
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>on major changes in consciousness, in language and in ways of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>understanding “reality.” There is rather surprising agreement
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>about the sort of societies women want. The feminist utopian
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ideal is a decentralized, cooperative anarchy, in which every
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>one has power over her or his own life. There are no laws and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>no taboos, except for cultural consensus against interference
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in others’ lives. The basic unit of social organization resembles
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>an extended family, but without biological basis. People do
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>not live together because they are related, but because they
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>choose each other. Bryant’s Ata has roughly 144 people;
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Staton’s Lir, about 100. Neither has a central government or
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>big cities, but there are highly developed communication
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>networks between social units and great opportunities for
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>horizontal mobility. Within the microcosmic units, people
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>know and cherish each other as in an ideal family; the good
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of the individual is not opposed to the good of others because
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>no one profits at the expense of those they love.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>The basic values of these societies are the growth and auto
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>nomy of the individual, yet individuals understand that no
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>one is an island, that all personal growth occurs in the context
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>of relationship with others. Luciente, in Piercy’s Woman on
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the Edge of Time, explains that to the people of utopian
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Mattapoisett: “The gift is in growing to care, to connect, to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>cooperate. Everything we learn aims to make us feel strong
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>in ourselves, connected to all living. At home.” This sense of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>community includes the natural as well as the social world.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>“You might say our—you’d say religion?—ideas made us see
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ourselves as partners with water, air, birds, fish, trees.” Deci
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sions for collective action are made by town councils, chosen
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>by lots and serving short rotating terms. The councils also
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>include advocates of animals and the earth chosen by dream.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Decisions are made not by majority rule forced on the minor
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ity, but by consensus (like the Quakers). Council members
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>simply keep discussing until everyone agrees. This process,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>although time-consuming, is ultimately efficient because every
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>one will implement the plan. Under majority rule, the people
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of Mattapoisett explain, much energy is spent trying to thwart
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the majority’s will.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Consensus is particularly important in anarchist societies so
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>no one is forced to do anything. Those disagreeing with the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>collective will are expected to act according to their con
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sciences. In Bryant’s Ata, people are guided by their dreams,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>shared every morning, on the assumption that everyone’s
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>dreams are valuable and authentic. If someone dreams that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the crops should be planted in a certain way and then crops
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>fail, they question their interpretation of the dream, but not
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the dreamer. In Staton’s Thoacdien civilization, a computer
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>network gives advice on the most sensible solutions, but no
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>one is compelled to take its advice. The Thoacdiens, more
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>over, communicate telepathically, and community consensus
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>can be arrived at in minutes.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>These societies are not materialistic. On Mattapoisett and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Ata, resources are scarce, but scarcity is not considered very
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>important. There are no differences in material wealth by race,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sex or class, and no one needs much. Material goods lack im
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>portance when everyone has the same amount and when goods
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>do not confer status. Production in itself is not a value, and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>attitudes toward work differ from those of capitalist society.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Individuals and the collective group àre on a journey of con
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>sciousness. People work because dependence on others’ work
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>is not conducive to one’s own growth of consciousness, and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>also because the process of work itself is valuable. The people
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of Ata learn that a certain amount of physical labor improves
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>their dreams, but to work past that point is “denagdeo”—does
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>not produce good or enlightening dreams. Piercy’s Luciente
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>explains, “after we dumped the jobs telling people what to do
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>counting money and moving it about, making people do what
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>they don’t want or bashing them for doing what they want, we
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>have lots of people to work. Kids work, old folks work, women
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and men work. . . . With most everybody at it part time, no
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>body breaks their back and grubs dawn to dusk.”
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Finally, truth, even reality itself, is seen as an ever-changing
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>process. As Mary Daly explains in Beyond God the Father,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>God is not a noun, but a verb; people, nature and the cosmos
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>are all God, individually and collectively evolvingand changing.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Thus the kin of Ata do not write down their sacred myths
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>because writing freezes language. Even if language could ade-
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>quately symbolize reality, that reality would have changed by
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>the time it was written down. The one time they attempted a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>written history of their myths, it had a deadening effect on the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>culture; people stopped dreaming “high dreams,” believing
			</p>
			<pb n='87'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that the static myths were truth, and ultimately they stopped
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>dreaming at all. “One by one they stopped the writing and the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>reading. They went back to the old way of telling the dreams
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in spoken words that rose like smoke and disappeared into the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>air to intermingle there, where there was room for an infinite
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>number of dreams, which could change and grow and become
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>closer to reality.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>These cooperative, decentralized, ecological, process-ori
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ented societies emerge from ideas that are in the air today
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>They are based on women’s experience in patriarchal society,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and they also reflect modern psychology, the occult tradition,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>modern science, philosophical romanticism and, of course, the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ideas and experience of the cooperative anarchist movement.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>First, and foremost, people in these fictional cultures do
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>not think dualistically. Charlotte Perkins Gilman, in her pio
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>neering utopian novel Herland, originally published in 1915,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>rejected the “theory of the essential opposition of good and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>evil; life to them was Growth; their pleasure was in growing
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and their duty also.”* In Staton’s utopian village of Lir, mor
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ality is based on the single question: “How do we manifest
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>potential?” “A person’s natural involvement” is assumed to be
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>’in the self.” Morality “is focused on the pleasurable discovery
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of the possibilities in selfness. It means doing, not possessing.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>In feminist utopias, the goal is not to rid the self of bad or
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>inappropriate qualities or to transcend the self (as it often is
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>in patriarchal societies); rather, it is to be whole. The denial
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of any qualities, Staton explains, leads to “dis-ease.” The
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>people of Lir have learned that “equilibrium is the natural
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>state for persons, and ultimately inevitable, once the screen
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>of systems has been removed.” Systems are “Basic Tenets,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Constitutions, Morals, Law, Belief, Ethics—any construct
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>which presumes to decide what is appropriate human behavior.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>... Only slaves will maintain a system. As they do not deny
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>parts of themselves, the people of Lir do not avoid disease;
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>rather, their goal is “to stay in balance.” Similarly, in Ata,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>they believe that ill health results from the “imbalance” that
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>occurs when people deny their dreams.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The major focus of Bryant’s and Staton’s novels is the jour
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ney from a primitive, linear mode of consciousness, marked by
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>internal repression and external oppression, to a more complex,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>multiple mode of thinking that results from the integration of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>thought and feeling, ratiocination and intuition, conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and unconscious minds. Bryant describes the process of the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>integration in Jungian terms, as a confrontation with a series
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of shadow figures. Her central character is an initially very
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>macho murderer. In Ata he dances with a series of repressed
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>shadow-identities, culminating with the shadow of the repres
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sed woman within him. When he lets her “dictate the dance,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>their integrated movements become “great sweeps of joy.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Freed of possession by the caged and angry woman within,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>he has no more need to oppress women.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Staton’s Biel has not been patriarchally socialized to repress
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>parts of herself; nevertheless, she confronts the patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Higgite band in a dream quest as a way of exploring her
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>primitive brain” and the “violence it contains.” Rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>suppressing these elements, she acts them out in a dream
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>psychodrama so that she can experience their consequences.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the pronoun “per” replaces “he” or “she” and words like
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>grasp” and “fasure” replace the dualistic “think” and “feel.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>associated with the discovery of identity; it does not confer

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>occurred when language was transformed to recognize the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>impossibility of owning or controlling anything, and to affirm
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the power of human intelligence to “embrace all concepts and

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>psychological health. Consistent with contemporary scientific
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ideas about time, this consciousness recognizes that even past,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>present and future are not discrete, separate entities. In Staton’s
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>words, “Times past, present, and future are simultaneous.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>is a disputed area.” Luciente, a woman from the utopian
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>future, explains, “Those of your time who fought hard for

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>their own yearnings. Staton describes Howard Scott as standing
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>before an invisible but tangible barrier—his time on one side,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and an entire new civilization on the other. Willingness to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>change was the key to passage through.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is one of society’s victims. Had the culture left her anything

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the creation of Mattapoisett, and notes that change occurred

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>band and son—her politics and her personal feelings. Beyond
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>such dualisms is a paradox. Men oppress women, the capitalist

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>own belief is that each century’s political theory follows on
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the heels of the last century’s science. The concepts of modern
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>physics employed in these novels provide models for nondual
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>istic questioning; the mathematicians move from “real” num
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>bers to “imaginary” ones. Beyond the concept of realism
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>versus “unrealistic” fantasy is a recognition of alternative
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>reality systems. The mode of analysis in the works discussed
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>here is based on the single question: What if? In modern
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>physics, the breakthrough occurred when Einstein hypo
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>thesized a new “imaginary” view of the universe. We test this
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>new understanding by acting as if it were real.

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>from the concept of scientist as “objective observer” to the

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>possible that alternative futures and pasts do exist simultan

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I realize why 1 was envying them. It has to do with the

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>as a normal, healthy, fulfilled human being, while the lack of
