				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Without reference to Literature or History, I want to tell some stories and give some historical back-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ground. In the beginning there is myself. And words, given to me by others. And bodies and minds of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>others which seem to fit my imagination. I consider whether I can name them lover. The desire for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>one—a woman—will make me burn in hell. The desire for the other—a man—is not desire. The one
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>whom I desire does not desire me. The one whom I tell myself to desire desires me passionately.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Neither pleases me. Both invade me with longing. Both are the only ones I would depend on, although
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>both seem to guarantee disappointment. Do I relish suffering, or is this my determination to make of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>something what it isn&apos;t?
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The one whom I desire to delight responds to being delighted: she is delighted. The one whom I can
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>delight is responsive: he delights himself. I can move over and through her body with care and passion,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and she agrees but cannot do the same. I lie in wait; my desire smolders; active reverts to passive; I can
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>do but I am not done to. He can move through my body without touching me; I can be done to with-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>out having done anything. Still I lie in wait, having little desire to act upon him but despising my
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>passiveness. My desire cools.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>lhis clitoris cannot demand attention, it can only expect it. I want to direct my own pleasure.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I have no patience left with lying back and receiving clumsy embraces. Depending on the other’s
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>understanding of my desires provokes rage, helplessness, and anxiety. His pleasure (of me, with me,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>would reach fruition without my ever having to do anything to him. I am not the active ingredient,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>though I could be if I cared to be. Her pleasure is in being done to by me as I know best — and I know
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>how—and I know because I know what can reach the deepest part of me when I lie back and let myself
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>be done to by one who knows.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I am not averse to being pleasured by another, but it isn’t enough to feel that the other might be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>convinced of the particularities of my desire. The rage and anxiety remain. I cannot always depend on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the good intentions of the other. Too often they fall asleep, muttering reassurances to me. Next time
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>He convinces me to let him take. She convinces me to give to her. I have agreed to this collusion.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>I resist because I cannot dictate my own rhythms. I will not forcibly please myself at the other’s ex
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>pense. If they are lacking, I cannot take control unless I masturbate, leaving myself once again alone
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in the presence of the other.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>There is the ideal: the balance of doing to (him, her) and being done to (by him, her). How often we
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>refuse being done to: there is the radical danger of vulnerability and selfishness. How often we refuse
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>doing to: we avoid the complexity of power and willfulness. How often he does and she is done to: a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>mute silence accompanies the act.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Two separate stories with the same ending: We fall into bed we fall onto the floor we hold onto we
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>clamber over we grind into each other, hands mouth teeth tongue grope over each other, ass palate
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>thighs throat nipples cunt cock clit. Being entered but I cannot enter. He has no orifice but the act is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>inside. I have an orifice but my depth is on the surface. He needs to be inside; I need him outside me.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>I am inside her when I am on her surface. Being on her outside is her inside pleasure, and is a vicarious
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>pleasure for me. He finds a repository for himself in me but he does not find me. I surround him but I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>want him surrounding me. I grow tired of words, but can my body explain myself when at last, my
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>surface on fire and my core white-hot, I cannot take my own pleasure but can only receive it?
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>My yearning for perfection endangers me. Now I can either acknowledge the limitations of the pleas
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>ures that I have received or remove myself firmly and quietly from the beds of my lovers. I must not be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>ungrateful. I must not be too grateful. There is a more profound pleasure. There is a limitless hunger
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>It has only been assuaged, but not satiated. When he, when she, when we recognize our limits, will
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>we have the courage to surpass them?

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Let us first look at the general
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ideal” pattern of the mother-child
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>interaction in our society. Within the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>nuclear family the infant is completely
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>dependent on the mother, both physi
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cally and emotionally. Without the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>mother&apos;s love, attention, and nur
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>turance the infant cannot survive.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Mother and child come to form an in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sulated unit, in which the mother satis
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>fies the infant’s physical and psycho
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>logical needs, while the infant provides
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>reciprocal gratification for the mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>This early interdependence has been
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>called the mother-child symbiosis.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>At first the infant experiences a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sense of omnipotence. When it cries,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the mother for the most part actively
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fulfills its needs. Indeed, the mother&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>needs seem to coincide with those of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the infant. The infant is presumed to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>have no sense of separateness from the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>mother, no concept of its own limits
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and boundaries.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>As the child matures, it becomes
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>aware of when the mother is in the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>room and when she is not. Usually
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>recognition of the mother’s absence
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>creates fear and insecurity for the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>child. Who will meet its needs? Now it
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>is the mother who comes to be viewed
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>as all-powerful. Since the child is still
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>physically and emotionally dependent
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>on her, she seems to determine its very
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>existence. Various patterns of pleasing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the mother and retaining her attention
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>develop. The mother’s own responsive
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ness to the child is of course a key
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>element in this interaction.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The phase of symbiosis peaks at
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>about four to five months. After this
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the normal child shows active signs of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>differentiating itself from the mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>The baby begins to explore its sur
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>roundings and is able to tolerate the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>mother&apos;s absence. This is the start of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the long process of separation for the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>child, of the search for autonomy. But
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>this process is problematic. And it may
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>be here that we can see differences in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>girls’ and boys’ experiences of the early
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>mother-child relationship.

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>pleteness and autonomy. From the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>beginning, the boy is more likely to be
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>treated as a heterosexual other by the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>mother, precisely because of his male
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>ness. The girl’s experience differs on
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>two counts. First of all, she doesn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>have a penis, which offers the son a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>clear physical distinction from the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mother and which, in our society, pro
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>vides him with a power symbol in op
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>position to the omnipotent mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Equally important, however, is that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the mother does not connect to the girl
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>as a sexual other, as with the male
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>child, but sees her daughter more as
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>part of herself. She may well overiden
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tify with her daughter and stifle the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>girl’s sexual development to prevent
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>signs of independence. A daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>may also reinvoke the mother’s own
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>fears of sexual inadequacy. The mother
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>may be protecting her own sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>vulnerability by restricting the girl’s
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>space to develop sexually. Few mothers
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>encourage a girl’s play with her body,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>much less masturbation. The tendency
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>has been to restrain sexual aggression
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in the girl and emphasize nice, respec
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>table behavior. We can see this as fit
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ting in with the mother’s image of her
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>self, which in its turn follows society&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>expectations. What seems important
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to underline, however, is that the girl’s
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>separation from the mother is compli
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>cated by the mother’s intense identi

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>This kind of identification heightens
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ambivalence about separation and

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>economically independent, with re

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>insecure and afraid. They find them

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>action they take. In some ways, Gam-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>beroff claims, they have re-created the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>same symbiosis with their men as they
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>had with their mothers. One of these
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>women explains that everything she
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>does, no matter how creative, is only

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>influenced our fantasies, we need to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>address the sources of ambivalence
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that stem from within ourselves and

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>One way to do this is to explore our

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>fantasy the orgasm fills me up for a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>long time, leaving me trembling and

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>crying with emotion. (I should empha
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>size that the man&apos;s reaction does not
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mean anything, except in the way that
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>my body triggers his desire and drives
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>him to fulfill all my wishes. The man is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>only an extra in my scene.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Another common fantasy involves
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a visit to the gynecologist. I am lying
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>there completely open, with his total
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>concentration on my sex. He begins
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the examination. In my fantasy he is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tender and very conscious of the way
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>he touches me. Suddenly he can tell
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that I am reacting differently. He feels
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>my juices, but he does not stop. He
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>continues and somehow prolongs the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>examination; not a word is said. He
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>inserts the instruments as I get wetter
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and wetter. He himself is getting
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>aroused by looking at the “beautiful
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>young woman” lying before him. He
			</p>
			<pb n='8'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>calls his colleague, and as the other
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>doctor enters, he, in one glance, under
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>stands what is going to happen. Softly
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>he says to me, &quot;I think I better examine
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>your breasts, and he quickly removes
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>my shirt. I am completely passive and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the only thing I can do is to pretena
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that I don’t have the vaguest idea of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>what&apos;s going on. And that’s when it
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>really begins. They are all over me,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>using every entrance and opening in
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my body. I can’t move. I have given
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>myself up to their hands. And then 1
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>have a huge orgasm—and that’s the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>end of my fantasy.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>If we look at these fantasies they
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>have quite a few things in common:
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>1. The feeling of lust is determined
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>by the man.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>2. The woman restrains herself
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and allows the initiative to come from
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the man.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>3. The woman expects overwhelm-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing desire from the man and thus does
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>not need to be active.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>4. The man takes control over her
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>body with a mixture of violence and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tenderness and “uses” her.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>5. The woman is in a state of help
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>lessness and powerlessness, dominated
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>by the man
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>6. It is, however, her body that
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>triggers his desire and her body that
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>drives him to fulfill all her needs with
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>out her being active.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>7. Due to her passivity, she has all
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of her needs met by the man.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>These seven points might be seen as
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>supporting the classical interpretation
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of female sexuality as inherently nar
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>cissistic and masochistic. But we can
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>also attribute these features to a carry
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>over from the early relationship with
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the mother. In the process of matur
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ing, the child has to discover its own
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>needs and distinguish itself from its
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>surroundings. This development takes
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>place under the guidance of the moth
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>er. If the mother is unable to give her
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>daughter love and space to mature, to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>separate and to be her own sexual be
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ing, the girl may remain stuck in a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>symbiotic definition. As we saw before,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>she may end up searching for someone
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>who can provide this, or she may re
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>gain the omnipotent partner through
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>fantasies.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Another aspect of the fantasies of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>dominance is that they create a situa
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tion where the woman doesn’t have to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>face the guilt of enjoying any form of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pleasure. She can deny that she has
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>any input into the situation; she can
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>say: “I experience pleasure —yes — but
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>it is against my will—I am not respon
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sible for the things that happen.” There
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is a feeling of omnipotence because she
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>is having all of her needs met. As with
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the mother, the man&apos;s needs become
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>secondary.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The Fear of Letting Go
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>One reason that women feel the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>need for fantasies is the fear of giving
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>themselves up to passion. What would
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>happen if we lost control of ourselves?
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Would we then lose our identity and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>be completely absorbed by the other
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>person?
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Even in my relationship with the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>man I feel most secure with, I am un
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>able to give myself up to him and to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>passion. I am afraid of what woula
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>happen if I let go. I fear that I would
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>disappear, that I would totally lose my
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>identity. Twice I have had terrible
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>experiences when my orgasm peaked. I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>was drunk and had lost some of my de
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>fenses. I felt myself falling down, into
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>black darkness. And I cried and cried
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>until I fell asleep. That’s why during
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>intercourse I hold onto myself and to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>my clitoris. Iam in control of my body.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>I give myself only to the point where I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>can still control the penis in my rhythm.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>One of the most remarkable con

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>trated here—the wish to be totally en
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>closed by the man and the fear of giv
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ing oneself up to him. There is both
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the fear of losing control and the fear
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>of merging with another person and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>losing one s&apos;identity. This fear of losing
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>one’s identity may originate in the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>early symbiotic relationship with the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>mother. With all the ambivalence at
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>tached to breaking away from the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>mother, there may be a greater fear of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>reengulfment in that original oneness.

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The Need for Intimacy
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I often think of my relationship to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the man I live with, and what it is that
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>makes me so dependent on him. This
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>dependency stretches from a need for
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>his confirmation of everything I do to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>an urge to know what he is doing every
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>minute of the day. I feel the symbiosis
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>keeps me from having independent
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>experiences outside our relationship.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>All the time I need his approval:I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>you love me? Do you love me more
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>than anything? Why do you love me?&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Sometimes I think it is his personality
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that makes me so dependent. But no. I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>know from earlier relationships that I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>develop the same kind of dependence
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>with any man.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In talking to other women about
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>dependency, I found we all voiced a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>strong need to be close to one person,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to have a place that felt like being
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>&quot;home.” A place where we could show
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>many sides of our personality and let
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>go of all the different masks. This need
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>for undisturbed harmony resembles
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the early mother-child relationship.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Yet, as we have seen, the wish to merge
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with another person has great fears at
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tached to it.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Closing Remarks
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>In feminist circles there has been a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tendency to focus on the sociological
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>aspects of repression, leaving aside the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>inner conflicts. The contradictions in

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>I find that the theories about early

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>white chest and back of the father. Vast, soft expanses of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>skin. Scrapy contact with badly shaved maternal calves
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rough touch of adult hands mussing my hair. I look at the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>monstrous thighs of these beings and compare them with my
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>own: so thin, nothing but a straight line, the natural link
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>between knees and hips.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The bodies move, get up, and dress themselves with fright
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ening mechanical movements and indecipherable prattling
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>noises. Lipstick, glasses, razors, combs, ties, girdles, bras,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>applied or added to the surface of these bodies in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>transform them. Or better yet; to hide them.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The paint dribbles cold on the nape of my neck and runs
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>down the length of my backbone; I shiver. My brother wields
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the paintbrush with dexterity, drawing long, green lines
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>from my shoulder blades to my armpits, from my buttocks to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>my neck. The thick liquid clots and cakes on my skin. My
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>brother shouts with laughter as he sees my face become dis
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>torted by the oozing mask of paint. The paintbrush tick
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>les as it slides under my chin, titillates my nipples and my
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>clit.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>It’s myturn and I start with his stomach, then cover his penis
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and tiny balls with paint in a series of provocative swirls.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>With great hilarity we drop the brushes, plunge our hands
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>into the can of paint, and slap them on each other’s heads.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Dripping and hysterical, we run to look at ourselves in the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>mirror: two Martians.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>In the empty bathtub we cling to one another and scream
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>with pain. The turpentine sears our skin. The mother’
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>movements are ungentle; she scrubs us with a nailbrush until
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the green has turned dark red. She grumbles and we weep.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>“Did you know you’ve got a piece of skin in there that’s going
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to be broken one day?

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>At the end of the tunnel. Do you want me to prove it?

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>“What&apos;s a manager?”

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>One of my brother’s friends doesn’t have a little sister; he has
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>never seen a girl’s or woman’s sex. Incredulous: “Not even
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>your mother’s?” “Never.” I pull down my pants. “Look, you
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>idiot. It’s nothing to be afraid of.” But he backs away
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>(though without averting his eyes). I take my pants off the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>rest ofthe way and chase him around the room, thrusting my
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pelvis forward and spreading the lips of my vagina with my
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>fingers. He yells and disappears. My brother and I collapse
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in helpless laughter
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>One day I go to verify the good condition of the father’s
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>organ. I pull at the elastic of his underpants to get a glimpse.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I am told that I have grown too big for that.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I know myself through touch and through my reflection in a

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>which of us it has chosen, but usually there is no room for
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>doubt. The garage is very cold. Shoes and stockings cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>be taken off first. Hesitation: the eyeglasses, of course, the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>hats and mittens, all the accouterments of winter with which
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>we’re only too happy to part. A skirt has already been re
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>moved, revealing a white slip and two bluish knees. A boy&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>torso has been denuded; it is covered with goosepimples and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>protected by two skinny arms, the freezing air serving as a
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pretext for modesty.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>The mother does my hair by separating it into two thick
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>locks, brushing each of them until my scalp stings, and final
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ly attaching them to my temples with a rubber band. My

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>He whines, horrified at the sight of the little heaps of himself

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the skin on the inside of the thighs.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>My brother has set fire to the garage. He has been whipped

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>l’d love to tell you how it feels.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>When it’s riding you out to the sky, and your
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>whole body is huddled in a point, and then it rockets
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>away from you on waves. I guess something about
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the ocean says it best. The smell. The origin there.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Conceived and then burst into a billion cells. I mean
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>we have all been intimate with the deepest creative
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>experience. We&apos;ve all been born.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I think people who are lost. That&apos;s what theyre
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>most lost from. And sex. Well that is one of the simp
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>lest and most thrilling ways to get it back again.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Sometimes I think if I could make love once a week
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>very awesomely, well that would really take care of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>it. But then when someone is around, I mean some
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>one llove, then I want to do it a lot more. And then I
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>think it&apos;s mostly for affection. Then the coming part
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>is different. It&apos;s a level that can be thoroughly satis
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>fying, but I don&apos;t have to have those stars. It&apos;s almost
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>bureaucratic. If I don&apos;t need to come, I don&apos;t. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>there are some days when I wake up, and I know that
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>at a certain second someone&apos;s going to touch me on
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the shoulder, and l’m going to quake. It definitely
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>gets easier. It never happened at all with my first
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>lover. There are those degrees. Where it&apos;s a certain
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>kind of thing that doesn&apos;t shake the sides. And then
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the one that grabs you so hard and takes you all the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>way there. I believe it’s really the easiest way to un-
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>derstand the state of grace. And then when the lover
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>begins to hoot and holler because he knows you&apos;ve
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>got it, then that’s the best. l’ve only met a few men
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>who could really gauge a wave.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I decided I didn&apos;t care about making love with a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of men because it takes so long to learn someone in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that way. It always feels like such a big struggle, and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>then the best are always the ones you are going to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>love in manifold.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I used to be so afraid of being sexy. Now it really
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tickles me. I like to get to the part where I can wear a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>slip. It still takes me a while to get down. And I really
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>only can with someone I like a lot. But then it&apos;s like
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the dance. And there&apos;s the step you do for yourself.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>And the step you do for your lover. And the step for
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the audience too. That&apos;s a push-up on white porce
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>lain.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Iguess certain people like certain things. Iknew one
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>who would grab my hair just above the wedge and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>make like he was going to touch that in the triangle
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>there. I loved the feeling of the tease. It wasn&apos;t tech
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>nique. He was learning to play an instrument well.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Men say the biggest thrill is to make it good for a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>woman. I can see how they&apos;d come to that. l&apos;d really
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>love to know what other people feel.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Kissing is my favorite part.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I like to stop before it all explodes. Just lying to

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and a hole. If I concentrate on what the space in my
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sex is holding, I can feel like I have a penis. We used
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to laugh that it was like being both sexes at the same
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>time. And it is.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Society definitely makes us shy. Women I mean. I

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Last year I saw this man at a party. We weren&apos;t

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>him passionately for three days. Then I called infor
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>mation and got his number. Called him up and cas
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ually invited him to meet me, explaining about the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>party we had been at together the weekend before. I
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was practically throwing up. But it was so instructive
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to realize what the social dating procedure feels like.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>He was busy and disinterested. After the phone call,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>it lost its significance for me. Except for the fat under

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>time. Meet a girl, make a date, get laid. It&apos;s terrifying.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Not much has been written on the phenomenon, or rather the set of phenomena, called faghagging.* One
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>recent book, The New Couple: Women and Gay Men, deals with hetero
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>sexual women only. The women I interviewed included a high proportion of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>lesbians; all the women interviewed were feminists. As one of my inter
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>viewees pointed out, there is not a single faghag population. Faghagging is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>a complex subject with potential for a lot of research, as well as potential
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>for overgeneralization and misunderstanding
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>Faghagging is not new and has appeared in some women’s writing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>Maureen Duffy, in The Microcosm, described a woman first becoming
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>ary and affirming, not a pejorative, sense.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>aware of her lesbianism by feeling strong fascination for two men who were, it was explained to her, homosexuals.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>In the well-known novels of Mary Renault and more recently in those of Patricia Nell Warren, the faghagging
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>element is exceptionally clear. The empathy for gay men that Elizabeth A. Lynn expresses in her science fiction
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>novel A Different Light is well matched by her awareness of women’s issues; this is not the case with all women
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>who write sympathetically about gay men, and for some, like Warren, strong male identification is evident.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>This leads to the question of why some women are primarily attracted to gay men. I would suggest that
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>women whose primary erotic objects are gay men have consciously or otherwise recognized men’s valued position
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>in society and desired to be valued as men are valued, while retaining a wish to be erotic with men. Their erotic
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>response to faggots comprises an awareness of a situation in which the erotic object is both sexually and socially
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>valued by other males — in other words, the woman recognizes in the faggot a socio-erotic position she herself would
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>like to hold, as the recognized peer and the lover of a male, a position impossible for women in sexist culture to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>secure. I believe this is the basis for the eroticization of gay men by women
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_l_2488' n='N001'/>*A faghag is a woman, whether lesbian, bisexu
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>al, or heterosexual, who devotes an important
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>part of her social, affectional, or sexual atten

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>finds them erotically interesting because of thein
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>homosexuality. This attention need not be overt;
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>it can take the form of fantasies. The word

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and love between men, in stories and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>so on, but I think Tommy was the first
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>gay man I ever really got to talk to. We
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>didn’t become close, because I was very
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>shy and awkward, especially with men,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>but I developed a crush on him.

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with another boy. And we got into
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>some fantasies about dressing him up
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>as a girl, but we never did. My girl

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>him and bite his ears and he would
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>scream and roll around and say, “Stop,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>stop!” I had sex with him: we decided
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>we were going to do it and we got in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the car and drove, till we found a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>place. He was probably the most posi

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to 15 years ago. We were friends and I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>didn’t think of it at the time as a sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>attraction, just as affection. I see now
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>there was an erotic component.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Amalthea: I would have been about
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>20 at the time. It was a close and sup

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>er, about 19.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Michelle: I was 21 years old. But I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>can’t say l was attracted to him because
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I “knew” he was gay. He continually
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>made references to a secret that he had
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>never been able to discuss with anyone
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>else and which had ruined several rela
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tionships with other women for him. I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>wonder how I could have been so naive
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as to have missed all the obvious hints.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Still my reasons for loving him suffered
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>no change when Dan did tell me he
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>was gay. I began to center my life
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>around him. Later I bitterly com
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>mented that my journal had become a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>journal about him rather than about
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>myself. Telling me that he was gay,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>coming out to me, seemed to me a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>great compliment and demonstration
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of trust. And I was even more attracted
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>to him. We did eventually have sex.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The first time, in fact, was on the night
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Dan finally broke down and told me
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>that he was attracted to men. I had
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>been wanting to have sex with him for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>more than a year and deathly afraid to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>instigate it. I was not very successfully
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>repressing the fear that the platonic
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>nature of our friendship was due to my
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>physical inadequacies —not being
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>beautiful, not being thin, not having
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>had enough experience. We eventually
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>decided to live with one another, and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>very quickly that arrangement became
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>one in which we were not lovers, mere-
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ly housemates. Our relationship re
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>sembled in most other ways that of a

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Dan, but added the extra burden of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>guilt that I was somehow wrong for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>wanting that, or certainly for pressing
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>for that. It became an extremely pain
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ful thing to me that Dan was attracted
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to friends of mine—other men—and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that he eventually developed a crush
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>on my brother, who had been out of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the closet for several years.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The main difference is that they give a

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>are better sex than straight men —they

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>society. I think things are said and done
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>that are derogatory to women. In 1979
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>I went to see a play. produced in a

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>character in the play was essentially an

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ments. One of the owners of the bar
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>got up—in the play women were not
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>welcome in the bar—and said, “You

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>what I think turns me on is the idea of

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to a man, was something that I wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>really badly for a long time. One thing
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that attracts me is the way they look-
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>not so much now, in America, because
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the short hair and mustache thing
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>bores me, but they do try to make
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>themselves look good, which is usually
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ignored by men or comes out all in a

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>when it’s decorative. By masculinity I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>mean physical strength, aggressive

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>can take over —them and the white

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>now we know that throughout history a

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>won’t let us be men. they want to do
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>everything we do. why these women
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>even go into gambling holes now and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>demand to shoot craps and play poker.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>and they win too. any gambler will tell

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>now this woman is holding us back.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and this is not anything new. we all
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>know this. it goes back to slavery. these
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women cooperated with the slavemas-

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>we are answering your questions in an essay so that we can better explain the history behind our answers.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>let us begin by saying our experiences have taught us that it is an enormous error to assume a person or group has
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>revolutionary consciousness just because the person or group is oppressed. that’s the error made by many of the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>whites who have been involved in the black struggle. especially we white women with black lovers or husbands.
			</p>
			<pb n='19'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>we romanticized black people especially black men to a dangerous degree. we were running from the reality we
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>learned growing up middle class, white and female. the reality we correctly diagnosed as patriarchal, imperial
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>istic, authoritarian, anal, humorless, colorless, odorless, tasteless, boring and dangerous. patripower, the reality
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>our white brothers are supposed to inherit from our fathers and we women are supposed to help perpetuate. in
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>stead of fighting it from our unique inside vantage point we ran to the people we saw as rebel/victims thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>their purity would shelter us. because of course we thought we needed sheltering.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>we didn’t see that the rebel/victims had absorbed patripower to such a degree they were actually reproducing it in
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>each other and that this reproduction was undermining the very struggle we were determined to help build. we
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>only saw their rebellious side, we didn’t let ourselves see their other side. just like we only saw one side of ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>- the rebellious side, we didn’t see that we too had absorbed and were reproducing patripower.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>what was holding us back was our belief that strategywise it’s most important to fight outside oppressive forces
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>imperialism and racism, the vietnam war, etc. we saw the enemy as being outside of/removed from our pure
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>selves. we ignored or denied our internal problems or said they’d be taken care of when “the most important strug
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>gle” had been won. but we could never get on with the “most important struggle” because this internal business
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was holding us back. we were embarked on an endless cycle of impotence.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>it was our involvement with other women —particularly poor black women —that led to our awareness of the im
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>portance of internal business. through our conversations with these women who suffer class and race as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sexual domination we learned that all men not just middle class white men use women, children and homosexuals
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to bolster their failing sense of masculinity when they are denied the so-called male right of economic domi
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>nation.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>we found that the stronger we became in our understanding of women’s oppression the more hostile the rebel/
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>victims became, as our understanding deepened our expectation of them and ourselves changed. we didn’t want
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to be sheltered anymore, and when we stopped allowing the rebel/victims to display us as trophies in their war
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with our fathers for the rights to the patripower table we lost the rest of our already dwindling appeal.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>now what usually happened at this point was the rebel/victims became sexually impotent. we were blamed. white
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>women are frigid, they told us. (although they had not previously voiced any complaints in this area and although
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>our sex drives remained constant.) suddenly these men saw they had made a serious mistake in becoming involved
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>with white women, we couldn’t meet their natural needs. they needed natural women who could restore their
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>magical lost manpower and resurrect their frostily entombed manhood. white women move aside, we’re going
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>home to our roots, they proclaimed.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>but when we began meeting these natural women— because of course the men insisted we meet their newtound
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>exemplary models of womanhood —we found them surprisingly shallow. they saw themselves as having a sacred
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>mission to reclaim their lost brothers to blackness. but their concept of blackness didn’t include encouraging thein
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>brothers to reject the male privilege aspects of patripower. our true black sisters helped us understand that the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>models of womanhood were aspiring to the very roles we were trying to outgrow and destroy. oreo cookies (wom
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>en’s division) is the term our true black sisters used
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>finally we had all the pieces in place. the rebel/victims were politically and sexually impotent because the aspects
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of their personalities and political philosophies that reflected the influence of patripower were holding back their
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>development, as they saw patripower crumbling around them, as they saw their personal patripower trophies dar
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ing to applaud the crumbling and even helping it along, they panicked.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>we are not surprised or alarmed by the HEW report. if anything it has not gone far enough in revealing the causes
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>behind what it called the massive wave of impotence, but that’s a job for black women. our group can only be of

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>europe, they started getting soft and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>next thing you know the commies are
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>taking over. kidnapping. bombing
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>striking, they’re looking to us to save
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the game, we gotta show ’em we can
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>deliver, our manhood is at stake for

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>take f10
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to tell you the truth it’s been so long since i had some i really have to stop for a moment and think about what i
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>think about what you are calling a national crisis.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>yeah. a long time ago i gave up counting on it or expecting it. gotta go through too many changes. men all want to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>reduce you to a lower (than them that is) common denominator, they gotta feel sorry for you or want to protect
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>you or punish you or some weird shit like that in order to get it up. who wants to be bothered under those con
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ditions?
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and then when i started trying to talk to him about it telling him my head wouldn’t compute those old signals any
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>more i started noticing the signs. then i knew what was going to happen. and it did. well at first i got scared and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>copped out to the old script—letting him reduce me so he could be big. but you know—it wouldn’t work. I
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>couldn’t be the I anymore, it was really funny cuz for a minute there i was in suspended animation, just
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>hanging.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>but then i decided i didn’t have to be a slave to these desires i’d been programmed to have and that i would just
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>wait til the time came when he could deal with me in a cooler way. no. i don’t hate him. in fact i really feel for
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>him. he’s got a big adjustment to make after all. and he’s so unprepared.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and then i thought about all the women who have had to do without it —sometimes for months and years at a time.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>what with wars, slavery, disease, jail, dope and whatnot. like in south africa. those sisters’ case is much heavier
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>than ours. their men have to go 100s of miles away from the bantustands where they are forced to live in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>find work. the government won’t let the women go. they have to stay with their kids and old people on the bantu
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>stands which are even worse than the reservations the native americans are jammed up in over here. the men live
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>at their jobs and they can only go home once or twice a year. they don’t make no money so they hardly ever have
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>any to send home to the bantustands. now what about those women? i mean that apartheid shit they have to deal
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with makes our shit look mild by comparison.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>so i looked at the south african sisters and i said if they can do it so can i. i’ve learned other ways of feeling close
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ness. ways that aren’t sexual and don’t necessarily involve relating to men. i’II tell you something. i was surprised
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>when i realized how much of my needs i expected to be filled by one person through an extremely limited range of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>experiences. isn&apos;t that a trip?
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>another advantage for me is that when he gets a hard time on his gig or something—you know his manhood is
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>threatened? well now he’ll have to find another way of dealing with that other than dragging some woman’s ass
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>across the floor and trying to fuck her through the mattress and box springs.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and who knows? if you give him enough time without an ass to drag and pound he might even get it together that
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>he ought to turn that hostility back on its real source. and if that happens— wowl watch out!

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Lesbians was entertainingly debunked.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The show was to be used in straight
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>sex-education classrooms and for com
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>munity organizations. One of the slides
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>was a comic representation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>myth of butch-fem relationships,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>with the voice-over being something
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>like: “In the past Lesbians copied
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>heterosexual styles, calling themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>butch and fem’ but they no longer do
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>so.” I waited until the end to make my
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>statement, but I sat there feeling that
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>we were so anxious to clean up our
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>lives for heterosexual acceptance that
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>we were ready to force our own people
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>into a denial of some deep parts of our
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>lives. I knew what a butch or fem
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>woman would feel seeing this slide
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>show, and I realized that the price for

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ance was too high. If we deny the sub
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ject of butch-fem relationships, we
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>deny the women who lived them and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>still do.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Because of the complexity and

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>look at the term “role-playing, used
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>primarily to summarize this way of lov-
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing. I do not think the term serves a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>purpose either as a label for or as a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>description of the experience. As a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>fem, I did what was natural for me,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>what felt right. I did not learn a part; I
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>perfected a way of loving. The artifi
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cial labels stood waiting for us as we
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>discovered our sexualities. We labeled
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ourselves as part of our cultural ritual,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and the language reflected our time in
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>history, but the words stood for com

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>butch or fem?” Many fled rather than
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>answer the question. The real question
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>behind this was: “Are you sexual?” and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>when one moved beyond the opening
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>gambits, a whole range of sexuality
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was possible. Butch and fem covered a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>wide variety of erotic responses. We
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>joked about being a butch fem or a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>femmy butch or feeling kiki (going
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>both ways). We joked about reversal of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>expectations: “Get a butch home and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>she turns over on her back. We had a

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>world for which many paid dearly. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>hard to re-create for the 1980’s what
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Lesbian sexual play and display meant
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in the 1950’s, but I think it is essential
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>for Lesbian-feminists to understand
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>without shame this part of their erotic
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>heritage. I also think the erotic for us,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>as colonized people, is part of our social
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>struggle to survive and change the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>world.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>A year ago some friends of mine
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>were talking about their experiences in
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>trying to explain butch-fem relation
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ships to a women’s studies class. Both
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>had been gay since the 1950’s and were
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>active in the early gay liberation strug
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>gles. “I tried to explain the complex
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>nature of butch sexuality, its balances
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of strength and delicacy,” Madeline
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>said. “The commitment to please each
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>other was totally different from that in
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>heterosexual relationships in which the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>woman existed to please the man. As
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>she spoke, I realized that not only was
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>there the erotic statement made by the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>two women together but there was and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>still is a butch sexuality and a fem

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sexuality but a developed, Lesbian,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>specific sexuality that has a historical
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>setting and a cultural function. For in

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>lovemaking; deep, strong givings and

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fem encounter. But the essential pleas
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ure was that we were two women, not
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>masqueraders. When a woman said,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Give it to me, baby!” as I strained to
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>take more of her hand inside me, I
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>never heard the voice of a man or of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>socially conditioned roles. I heard the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>call of a woman world-traveler, a brave
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>woman, whose hands challenged every
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>denial laid on a woman’s life.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>For me, the erotic essence of the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>butch-fem relationship was the ex
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ternal difference of women&apos;s textures
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and the bond of knowledgeable caring.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>I loved my lover for how she stood as
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>well as for what she did. Dress was a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>part of it —the erotic signal of her hair
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>at the nape of her neck, touching the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>shirt collar; how she held a cigarette;
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the symbolic pinky ring flashing as she
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>waved her hand. I know this sounds
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>superficial, but all these gestures were
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>a style of self-presentation that made
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>erotic competence a political statement
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>in the 1950’s. A deep partnership
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>could be formed with as many shared
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>tasks as there are now and with an
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>encouragement of the style which made

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>clearer. My hands and lips did what

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing was the overwhelming love I felt
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>for their courage, the bravery of their

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>As a way of ignoring what butch-

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>often viewed as the validating starting
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>point of healthy Lesbian culture. I be
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>lieve, however, that many Lesbians,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>pre-Stonewall, were feminists, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>primary way this feminism, this auton
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>omy of sexual and social identities, was
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>expressed was precisely in the form of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sexual adventuring that now appears
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>so oppressive. If butch-fem represent

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>also symbolized many other forms of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>independence. Most of the women I
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>knew in the Sea Colony were working
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women who either had never married
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>or who had left their husbands and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>were thus solely responsible for their
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>own economic survival. Family con
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>nections had been severed or the fami
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>lies were poorer than the women them
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>selves. These were women who knew
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>they were going to work for the rest of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>their Lesbian days to support them
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>selves and the home they chose to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>create. They were hairdressers, taxi
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>drivers, telephone operators, who were
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>also butch-fem women. Their femi
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>nism was not an articulated theory; it
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>was a lived set of options based on
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>erotic choices.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>We Lesbians from the 1950’s made
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a mistake in the early 1970’s: we al-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lowed our lives to be trivialized and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>reinterpreted by feminists who did not
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>share our culture. The slogan “Les

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the theory” was a good rallying cry,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>but it cheated our herstory. The early
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>writings need to be reexamined to see
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>why so many of us dedicated ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>to understanding the homophobia of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>straight feminists rather than to under

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I’ve been thinking a lot about writing an article for the sexuality issue, because I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>have a perspective that I am afraid otherwise won&apos;t be included in the issue. But I can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>create enough order in my thoughts or imagine an article format that wouldn&apos;t distort
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the thoughts. So a letter will have to do
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>What I want to write about is celibacy as a viable sexual choice. Now, in my years
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of sexual activity, I would never have believed it if someone had told me that I would
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ever choose to be celibate for years. And yet, that has been one of the wisest, most self
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>affirming choices I have ever made. That decision (or rather, decisions, since I have made
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>it again and again) has given me space to discover myself, to learn to love myself. I’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>developed a sense of my sexuality as a part of myself, rather than as a need that drives
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and consumes me, obliterating my self.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Making love to myself, I’ve learned that much of the power to make me feel and ex-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>perience what I once gave to men (thinking they made me feel that way) in fact belongs
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to me, is a part of my own personal power—mine to own and exercise. Owning that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>power (which I don’t think I ever could have done as long as I continued to relate sexu
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ally to other people) has given me the strength to begin to own my life, to build a life and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>center apart from all the patriarchal madness.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>People ask me, “Don’t you missit? Don’t you ever want a lover, someone&apos;s arms
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>around you?” I can only answer that physical affection doesn’t have to be restricted to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>sex, that I can hold and be held without “getting it on.” Besides, one of the best things
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about long-term celibacy (say, more than six months) is that I don&apos;t get “horny” any
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>more. Of course, there are times when I feel sexual—then I can choose to masturbate or
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>not—but I don&apos;t have that driven, gnawing need which can only be satisfied by another
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>often not available, person. When I have sexual dreams, I usually dream of my vibrator.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>People have a lot of trouble accepting or understanding this.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>In fact, the biggest problem with celibacy is the reaction to it. Most people just
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>don&apos;t believeit. Straights (men and women) assume, almost invariably, that what I mean
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>when I say l’m celibate is that I don’t sleep with men but am sexually active with women
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>(somehow, in this view, sleeping with women doesn’t count). Lesbians and gay men as
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sume it&apos;sjust a closet act, that I have a sexual relationship with the woman I live with
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and am too repressed to admit it. When I finally get people to accept the reality of it,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>everyone assumes (1) that it&apos;s really sad that l’m celibate, (2) that it’s something I want
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>to change or at least ought to want to change, and (3) that whatever emotional problems
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and struggles I have are because I am sexually repressed.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The heaviest social cost of celibacy, though, is that it keeps me on the fringes of the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>women&apos;s community. I consider myself woman-identified and woman-centered. If and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>when I choose to relate sexually to people again, it will almost certainly be with women.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>But I don’t sleep with women now—I’m not waiting to get my courage up—I’m celibate.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>And passing as gay because it allows me to belong socially seems as wrong as passing
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>for straight because it allows one to belong socially. If passing is wrong—as I believe it is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>—then it&apos;s wrong in all situations. But the condescension, pity, and pressure I usually
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>meet in the lesbian community means that I don’t feel accepted, and without acceptance
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>there is no community for me. So, finally, I am lonely being celibate—not because I lack
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>a lover but because women can’t accept my choice and reality.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>I would never presume that another woman should choose celibacy. But feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>have much to gain, as individuals and as a group, from more recognition and acceptance
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of celibacy as an option. It has been a growth situation for me and for the other women
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>I know who are celibate. Celibacy allowed me to refuse to give my sexual energy and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>support to men. It allowed me to grow strong and free within myself. And when/if I be
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>come involved in interpersonal sex again, it will be with a clear sense of freedom and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>choice. And with a clear sense of myself as a woman—free and strong and whole. And

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>l’m glad to be a part of this discussion of celibacy in the sexuality issue. I will try to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>respond to your points one at atime, but I want to emphasize that I can only say how it
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>is for me.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>1. How does masturbation bring me closer to myself? Some of these ways seem obvi-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ous: by providing myself with a positive sexual experience, by claiming for myself my
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>own sexual power, by using masturbation as an opportunity to love myself. In the ab
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sence of the power plays and inequalities that can and often do happen in interpersonal
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sex, the act of giving myself orgasms becomes self-affirming and strengthening.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>A couple of years ago I noticed that while I masturbated I often thought about my
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>problems—especially situations in which I felt I had less power than other people (e.g.,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>work). At first I was freaked—was I so obsessed with my problems that I couldn’t even
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>stop thinking about them during sex? But it didn’t feel like a negative process. Eventu-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ally I realized that such thinking time is really productive—while masturbating, or in
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>my dreams at night, I often find solutions that eluded me before, or new ways of looking
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>at my problems. Somehow, when I masturbate, I am more in tune with my personal
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>power; Iidentify more with my own woman strength. In this emotional geography, I can
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>find a place of strength from which to operate in the troublesome situation. So mastur
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>bating is a way of providing a climate of self-love and affirmation, a place of strength
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and support for myself—an empowering act in my daily life.

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>2. Does all sexual interaction lead to obliteration of the self? I don’t know. It seems
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to me that orgasm involves a dissolution, or at least a blurring, of ego boundaries. In an
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>interpersonal situation, that can lead to obliteration of the self—especially in a culture
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>such as ours where we have all been so brainwashed by this romantic love garbage (two
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>people merging into one self, being completed by one’s true love, etc.). Given the me
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>chanics of penetration, I suspect that heterosexual sex has an inherent tendency, at
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>least, to obliterate the female self. I suppose that in a situation in which power was bal
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>anced and both lovers were really centered in themselves and had a genuine respect for
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>one another, it would be possible to have sex which was not destructive of either wom
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>an&apos;s self. Perhaps because I found heterosexual sex so damaging, a mutually affirming
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>situation is hard for me to imagine.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>3. How can women retain their sense of self and have sexual pleasure with others?
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I don’t know. If I did, I might be closer to ending my celibacy. Women who are maintain
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing their selfhood while active in interpersonal sex will have to answer this question.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>4. Why do our friends find celibacy so problematic? Why are people ever threatened
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>by other people making different choices and having different lives? Somehow, we have
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ended up with a notion of obligatory sexuality that is as rigid as the Victorian notion of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>chastity. Our phallocentric culture defines interpersonal sex as a necessary aspect of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>healthy adult life, and most people—men and women—accept that judgment. Over the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>years, my close friends have come to accept my choice, and some of them can even see
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the virtues of it. But in a sexualized society like ours it&apos;s hard to convince people that
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>celibacy is a healthy choice rather than a bad case of sexual prudery, repression, im
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>maturity, or just plain neurosis.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>In situations in the straight world in which there is no hope of people perceiving
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>my celibacy as anything other than frustrated heterosexuality, Iidentify myself as a
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>lesbian. But in situations in which there is some chance of women understanding where
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Iam coming from, I try to be open about my choice, hoping to get women to think about
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>celibacy
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>5. Has my relationship to the women’s community changed? The distancing I ex-
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>perience from many lesbians hasn&apos;t changed; I don’t feel any more acceptable to gay
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>women. But l’m more resigned—I’ve tailored my expectations to the reality of it. I see
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that part of the distance I feel comes from my own sense of alienation in reaction to the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>extreme expression of sexuality that I sometimes see at women&apos;s gatherings—a mode of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>acting and being that I perceive as being heavily based on the sexual objectification of
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>other women.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>l’ve learned to find a sense of connection with the larger women&apos;s community in
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>movement literature, just as I would if I lived in an area which was geographically
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>remote from centers of feminist culture. Once in a while I find a feminist who can under
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>stand and empathize with my choice, even though she may not choose it for herself. So I
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>don&apos;t have the sense of longing and alienation that I did a year ago. But I still feel sad
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that I can’t make my real life embody the sense of belonging and participation that I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>when Iread Adrienne Rich.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>6. Has my understanding of celibacy changed? l’ve become more aware of the price
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>I pay for the space: celibacy does cut down on the physical affection I express and re
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ceive. As my sole source of sexual sensation, celibacy does get a little bit monotonous
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>(like any sexual malaise, this one comes mostly from my own laziness and lack of imagi
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>nation, I suspect). I occasionally find myself consciously attracted to another person.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>But at this point, after almost six years, I still find celibacy a nurturing and self
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>enhancing choice. I don’t feel frustrated, or hemmed in, or confined by my celibacy, but
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>rather nourished and strengthened.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>I feel alittle bit nervous about publishing such a personal letter. But I still feel that
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>t&apos;simportant that celibacy be represented among the perspectives included in any dis
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>cussion of sexuality among women. I think women have much to gain by perceiving
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>celibacy as a real option in their lives, whether or not they ever actually become celibate.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>I want to share with other women the sense of freedom, space, and growth that celibacy
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>can offer.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>had never considered “the personal is
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>political.” Or as if that slogan were just

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>us to work on issue f12. Although we

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>why I call myself a feminist. I believe
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that the society I live in is a patriarchy,

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>preceded by a negotiation in which the

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>they will play, what activities are likely
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to occur, what activities will not occur,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and about how long the scene will last.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The bottom is usually given a “safe

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The key word to understanding
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>S/M is fantasy. The roles, dialogue,

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>part of a drama or ritual. The partici

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that a role adopted during a scene is
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>not appropriate during other interac
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>tions and that a fantasy role is not the

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>time mistress. In fact, the stubborn

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>about being slaves to the whims of their
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>bottoms. After all, the top’s pleasure is
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>dependent on the bottom’s willingness
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to play. This gives most sadists a mild

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of sadomasochists. A major part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sadist’s turn-on consists of deliberate

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>enough to mar the scene. And, of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>course, a bottom can’t relax and enjoy
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the sex if she doesn’t completely trust
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>her top. The S/M community makes

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Commercial pornography distorts
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>all forms of sexual behavior. There are
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>several reasons for this. One is that it is
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>designed to make money, not to edu-
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>cate people or be aesthetically pleas

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and thus must be produced as quickly
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and surreptitiously as possible. Anoth
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>er reason is that erotic material is
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>intended to gratify fantasy, not serve as
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a model for actual behavior.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>S/M pornography can be divided
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>into several types, each designed for a

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>since the largest market for S/M porn
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>is heterosexual submissive males. Very

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>since many of us make contact via per

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>other person. When a rape or assault is

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>forethought and planning. But legally.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a free society must distinguish between
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the fantasy or thought of committing a

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I am often asked if sadomasochism
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>will survive the revolution. I think all

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>use to describe ourselves will change
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dramatically in the next 100 years,

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>that we must enjoy being oppressed
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and mistreated. We like to wear uni

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I used to be a stripper.

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>even seen one. I found I loved the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>work. I stayed with it for years, learned
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to do it well, made it my art and my
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>profession. But I always wondered how
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>it was that I had taken to it so easily,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>did it so well, found it so fulfilling.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>What did it say about me, when, as an
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>avowed feminist, I was so involved in a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>quintessentially sexist business? Where
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were those things I did on stage coming
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>from? In real life, my sexual overtures
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>were covert, or verbal: my clothes,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>jeans and sneakers. I worried. Was I
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>crazy, a repressed pervert, a closet
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>glamour girl? I came to see, however,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that my love of striptease had less to do
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>with any personal kinks than with the

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>It all began to make sense to me
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>one night as I watched another strip
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>per perform. A big woman, with a

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and theater training—I admired her

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ence was power. The men came, some
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of them, to suffer; their attitude was:
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>“She is making me horny, but l’Il never
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>have her. To them, the show was ex

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>stage, a tormentor. The other group of
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>men came to pull imaginary strings;
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>they saw themselves as masters, think

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>those dirty things for me.” In other
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>words, some of the men fantasized
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>themselves as passive, others as dom

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Later, I saw the situation as less
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>clear-cut. Many of the men felt both

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>wanted a sexual thrill with no personal
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>effort, and yielded all responsibility to
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the woman on stage. The stripper was
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the single dynamic force in a room full
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of passive people. The male attitude
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was also a challenge: “Make me re

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>getting a taste of what it would be like
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to be a woman in a society that honors
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the animal vitality in us all, instead of
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>despising it.

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>stripper. She is being sexy on purpose,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the initiator, not the victim. Not walk
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ing down the street hunched over lest

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>for his delectation, but thrusting bare

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>And he can’t touch her. The strip
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>per is inviolable. That stage is hassle
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>free. For one thing, there is a boundary
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>between any performer and audience
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that few dare cross. For another, the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>man watching striptease thinks that
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>any response from him is a point for
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the opposition. The stripper is trying
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to make him respond; to show he is
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>moved is to openly grant her power.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The game has silly, sexist rules, but a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>woman can win it. We are taught to
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>fear the sexual arousal of men. When
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>a stripper’s show is going well, the air is
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>thick, charged with sexuality, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>is in total control.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>This pleasant feeling of immunity
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>is close to contempt. As in the fantasy
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>of the passive man, the stripper takes
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>pleasure in being a tormentor. While I

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>were the gay women.

			<pb n='39'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>real world, the stage freedom would
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>not matter. I thought I was crazy be
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>cause both the conventional, male
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>dominated outlook and feminist doc
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>trine defined what I did as bad. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>having forbidden fun. I knew that the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>joyousness, the pride in my body and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>its abilities, was good. In order to claim
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the feminine power for my own, I gave
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>it a name: feminissima.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The word was also a way to own my
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>aggression. The warrior-woman, using
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sexuality as a weapon, is a masculinist
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>construct, the true counterpart of the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>macho male. Feminissima may have
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>been a tongue-in-cheek word for me at
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>first, but I saw it was a positive way to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>describe an aggressive female stance,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>one that implied power in femaleness
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>rather than in imitation maleness.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>It also meant reclaiming pride in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>being physically feminine, in using
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>female body language and the arts of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ornamentation. No stripper works
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>directly from her sexuality; that is, she
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>does not try to simulate how she looks
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and feels making love. Stage sexuality
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>is a highly technical matter. My work
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>made me very conscious of what goes
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>into the commercial image of female
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sexuality, and so let me see my natural
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>sexuality more clearly.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I realized that I knew how to be
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sexy on stage because, like all women,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>I had been trained as a girl in sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>body language. Knowing just what

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ments, and postures excited men was
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>part of my woman’s heritage. Becom

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>trol of it. I could choose when and how
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to use sexual body language. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>good to know this, to respect our vast
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and ancient knowledge, usually labeled

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>just how sexy I was, made for narcissism.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I felt a lot of sexual frustration,

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>state of sexual tension. The job is,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>however, very isolating socially: either
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I was in a strange town or full of energy

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>complicated by anger. Men were my

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>theirs. Playing the role of sex object to

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>situation between men and women was
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>for the first time. I felt powerful, but
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>also angry and cynical.

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>come into me. I felt bigger than life.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>but did not so much feel it myself as

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was a kind of altered consciousness, a

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>when I tried for it. It was a mystery,

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>I have been primarily discussing
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>woman-centered sexual imagery in
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>figurative art. However for many
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>women a strong body sense is indicated
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>through their use of materials and the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>physical manipulation of those materi
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>als. Like many artists, women have
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>played with the sensuousness of thick
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>paint, but it is most often with an
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>awareness of the paint being a “skin
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of paint, and therefore a body/skin
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>metaphor.“ I immediately think of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Louise Kramer’s giant inflated latex
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>balls with their organic skin surfaces,

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>scraped off with a palette knife —the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>resulting surface sensuous yet re
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>strained, often painful, like layers of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>skin scratched away, revealing what is
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>underneath. When Joan Snyder slashes

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>also speaks of the sexual violence done

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>artists. They say that getting in touch
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with their physical/sexual selves tapped
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>their creative selves and that this al

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In this respect, Debbie Jones draws

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that straight women depict female

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>while lesbians depict the same forms as

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>totally agree. The boundaries aren’t
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>all that clear. What Jones points out
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>certainly seems true of art by lesbians
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>working with sexual imagery, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>also seems true of any woman-centered
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sexual imagery. The work is felt, not
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>viewed from a distance, and the sexu
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ality comes from a sense of wholeness,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>touching one’s wholeness, one’s whole
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>self. While some of us may feel the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>work is lesbian in that sense, this wom
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>an-centered work is made both by

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>each slide was interpreted to reveal its

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that she was obviously under age, so at
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the least it was statutory rape. The lec

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>groups, we walked down 42nd Street,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>entering the shops and arcades where

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>contraception and shame. The short

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was undeniably about sex.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I was grateful for this opportunity
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to demystify a territory that had been

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ever, I was more curious than ever
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>about the meaning and function of

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>had been, for me, the price all women

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>speak of our desires, only answer “yes’
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>or “no. The tour evoked complex
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>reactions, including envy, fear, and
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>sexual arousal. The social and psychic
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>repression of my female desire was
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>giving way, every so slightly, under the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>barrage of sexual imagery. I was a

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>many questions for me. What is the

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>And what does the volume of business

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>us about the nature of desire and its
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>relation to fantasy? Is pornography
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>really any more dangerous to women
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>than fashion magazines, television
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>commercials, and cinema? Otherness
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in the guise of domestic purity and
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>mindless submission seems more per
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>nicious than Otherness in the guise of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sexual activity. How, I wondered, can
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>we begin to measure the effects of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>objectification in pornography when
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the Otherness ascribed to us at birth

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>us as socially inferior? Such an ancient
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Otherness leaves little room for any
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>avowal of our subjectivity. Moreover,
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>reality and representation of reality
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>are not the same. Objectification may
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>be a function of representation. All the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>actors (male and female) in pornog
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>raphy are objectified. They do not
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>speak. They are not individuals. They
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>have no depth, no contours. They are
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the ritual performers of the culture&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>sexual paradigms. They are not the
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>real, but a commentary on the real.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>What I felt after the tour and slide

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Pornography “really” acts to disinhibit

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>battery, and child molestation. This

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>What I am suggesting here is not a

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Specifically, what we might take
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>from male pornography is a vision of
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the mutability of sexual experience
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and a variety of directions for sexual

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>number of sexual practices that have
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>been taboo for women. As voyeurs, we

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ground of political repression. While

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>an attempt to introduce a non-moral
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>istic view of sexual practice. Of course,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>pornography is not a substitute for
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>sexual practice, though it might be an
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>addition to it. Even if women were to

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>we would only be able to change the

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>took my plate in one night and sat

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>loneliness, to show he could count on

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>closer as a family. Maybe finally he
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>could become a real person, a father to
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>us, instead of the shadowy figure we

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>alls for, giggled about when he hollered

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>time, except on weekends, when beer
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and bourbon filled his head with fumes
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of courage. At those times his person

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to get their minds off Mother. So Dad
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>dy and I sat at the table alone. We
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>were sitting the long way, at opposite
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ends of the table. I was contemplating

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>that promised I would meet my mother

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>soft hairs on the back of my neck rose
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>slowły, a few at a time. I wished myself
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>out of the room, out of my skin, out of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>life. “I would say no. With a slight

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>paralyzing fear that coated me like a
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>second skin. My mind flashed, search

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was missing: a sense of protection, of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>safety.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Well, that’s what I thought, he
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>said speculatively, “but something told
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>me to ask the girl.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The rest of the evening is a blur.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Not daring to move, to disturb the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>thickness of the air in the room, I must
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>have continued with my writing. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cloudiness that swirled inside my head,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I think I tried to erase the words and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the entire conversation (an exercise I
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was to attempt many times afterwards).
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Wishing—no, willing—it had never
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>occurred, I nearly believed my will had
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>prevailed. As long as it was never men
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tioned again...
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>A very short time after that the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>nighttime visits began. Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>walking softly, sometimes having re

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>crawling, he came through the bath
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>room that connected our bedrooms,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>like some mad incarnation of grief,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>pain, and desire.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>“Please, just come and lie in the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>bed.. it’s so empty.. I won’t bother

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>No, Daddy. It’s not right. No.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>So this is how it was: I was a 16-
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>year-old Black girl, living in a small
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>college town, who had lost forever the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>one adult I had loved and trusted
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>totally. My life was never to be the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>same again—that I knew for a fact.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>My mother touched the part of me I
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>liked best, the part that was not shy.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Since she was somewhat reserved, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>able to be aggressive with her in a fun
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>sort of way. Outside of my three sisters,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>she was the only human being who
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>really knew me. When we were all
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>home together and Daddy wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>around to cast a pall on things with his
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>grouchiness, there was a warmth to the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>air and a fullness in my heart that I
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>comfortably took for granted, until it
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was suddenly gone one cold night. And
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>now the only other person on whom I
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>could depend for my protection and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>well-being had decided on the disturb
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ing course my life was to take for years
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to come.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Granny and Big Mama lived down
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>stairs in the basement, and they must
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>have heard him in the early hours of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the morning making his slow, steady
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>way to my room, especially later when
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>I took over Rita’s room at the back of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the house. He was their landlord, how
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ever, as well as their son and nephew.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>They had to look out for their own
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>skins; they were old and he was not
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>overly generous. They did tell him
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>when I had Michael over, for which
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I was put on punishment (no after
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>school activities). But if they ever
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>said anything to him about bothering
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>me, I know nothing of it. Before she
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>moved out to her own apartment, Rita
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>was approached half-heartedly once or
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>twice: “Daddy, get out of here...I ain’t
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>playin’ with you. Somehów her words
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>stuck where mine did not. And some
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>how, over the countless weekends,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Karen and Delores managed to sleep
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>through it all, just as they had the

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>From age 16 until nearly 20, except
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>for the two semesters I lived uptown in
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the dormitory, Daddy and I each
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>awaited Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>nights with different emotions. Mine
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>was fear, pure and simple—his, I
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>guess, anticipation. He never drank
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>during the week—those days we acted
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>as if nothing out of the ordinary were
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>going on. If he ever despised himself
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>for what he was doing, it never showed.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>I began to devise homemade locks for
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the two bedroom doors—pathetic,

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>stretchy little things made of nylon
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>stockings. He ordered me to remove
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>them. I did. I furrowed out hiding
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>places in the closet, which I never used
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>because I was afraid of being trapped
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>inside. Once at 3:30 in the morning I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>calmly walked 10 blocks to Rita’s
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>apartment. As I pulled the back door
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of our house shut behind me and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tripped down the stairs, I breathed in
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the fresh cold night air of freedom. I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>wished I would never have to go home
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>again. Daddy called the next day and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ordered me to return within the hour.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>As his campaign of harassment
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>mounted, Daddy employed different
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tactics. First he was pleading, begging,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cajoling: “Just because you read some
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>thing in a textbook that said it&apos;s wrong,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>are you going to go by that?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>thought you said you wanted to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>social worker.” Later he would stumble
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in from lord-knows-where and say,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>want something clean, or “l guess you
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>remind me of your mother.. your size
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and all.” Then he became the stemn
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>father, once actually getting into my
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>bed when I was in another room and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>then ordering me to come get in also. I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>refused. Still later he played the loving
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>father role, greeting me with, “Come
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>give me a hug.” I can remember stand
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ing very still one afternoon while he
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>rubbed Vicks on my chest. He made
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>me open a few buttons of my shirt so
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>he could rub down to the tops of my
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>breasts. He insisted on doing it himself
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>—so concerned was he for my health
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that he couldn’t trust me to do it my
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>self.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Late one Saturday night I sat on
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>one of the twin beds in the kids&apos; room
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>watching a movie on TV. On the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>screen a pale, flaccid white man with a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>bad case of asthma was muttering into
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>a phone, threatening a woman on the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>other end. Later in the movie, he kid
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>napped the woman’s younger sister and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>made her strip so he could send her
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>clothes as proof that she was with him.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Looking at the girl standing there, so
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>young and soft in only her bra and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>panties, the man started getting other
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ideas. I sat quietly, drawn into the set,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>despising the girl who wore fear on her
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>face so blatantly. I wished the wheez-
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ing man, who in his powerfulness had
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>somehow become attractive, would do
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>everything he wanted to her —would
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>make her cry and then laugh cruelly at
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her pitiful weakness. Daddy came into
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the room and stood behind me.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Here, take this.” It was a highball
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>he was holding out to me—not offer
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ing it but shoving it at me. I could
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>smell the strong liquor and guessed the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>drink was almost straight alcohol. He
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>had never let me drink before; the issue
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>had never even come up, so out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>question was it.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I don’t want that, I said, not tak-
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ing my eyes off the TV.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>His voice was thoughtful, musing:
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>“Now I said to myself, I could get the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>girl drunk, or I could choke her lightly
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>just until she went out.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I had always been afraid, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>fear had come from feeling the ground
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>shift under my feet as my most basic
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>beliefs were relentlessly
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>challenged.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Now my fear was physical. Daddy was
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>talking rape—and worse. The rules
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>had suddenly changed: there were no
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>rules. I began to think he was insane
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and therefore capable of anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>That was the night I walked to Rita&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>apartment. Rita talked to her boss—a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>white man —who said that unless Dad-
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>dy had actually touched me (which he
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>hadn’t), there was nothing to be done
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>legally. He suggested we talk to our
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>minister. I thought of Reverend Cyp
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>rus, a dried-out old turtle of a Negro
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>who didn’t even know me, so rare were
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>our visits to church. Daddy either over
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>heard us talking or guessed what Rita
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>had done, or maybe he just predicted
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>what we might do. In his authoritative
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>father’s voice, he warned us about
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>putting family business in the street
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and involving white people in our
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>affairs.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>The Christmas of the first year I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>was in the dormitory Daddy gave me a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Panasonic radio. It was made of wood
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and was very nice. When he was get
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>ting ready to drive me back to school,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>he said, “I didn’t get what I wanted for
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Christmas, and for a fraction of a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>second before his meaning sunk in, I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>was wildly hopeful there was some par-
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>ticular thing I could buy for him,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>thereby putting an end to his desperate
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>pursuit.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In remembering those years, I have
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>a sense of being pulled constantly in
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>many different directions. Knowing
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>there was no chance I would willingly
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>give in to Daddy, I counted on some
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>paternal instinct that must still exist
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>inside him which would not allow him
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to attack me outright. And I felt
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>strongly protective of Karen and De
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>lores, even more so after Rita moved
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>out. I must be there to see that as
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>they matured they were not subjected
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to the same sexual pressure that was
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>directed at me. Then, too, what would
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>happen if I did get up my nerve and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>make the first steps toward prosecuting
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>him? Rita was only two years older
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>than I, and surely she would not be
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>allowed to have custody of the three of
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>us. Life with Granny and Big Mama
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was unthinkable; it would be too dif
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ferent from what we knew. Would we
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>be split up into foster homes? Beyond
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the need to find a solution to my prob
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>lem with Daddy, the need to somehow
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>keep the remaining family together
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>asserted itself at all times. And always
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I felt myself mourning the loss not only
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of a mother, but of a father as well.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Ilived with this situation for nearly
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>four years of my life, years in which
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>young girls develop crushes and find
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>boyfriends and get involved in healthy
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sex. Although I was very loose with my
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>body when I dated, I was technically a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>virgin until I was 22. I was so tight and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tense that I could not be entered. But
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>no man could call me a tease or a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>prude, because, after all, wasn’t I will
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ing, even eager, to get into bed with
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>him? Underneath it all, however, I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>knew whose side I was on, and I secret-
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ly applauded my unyielding body. I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>was 21 when I gave in carelessly to a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Chicano I met in a bar one night. I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>don’t remember how it felt to finally
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>complete the sex act, because I was
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>going into the second of a series of ner
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>vous breakdowns that I suffered be
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>tween the ages of 21 and 25.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>I am better now, living all the way
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>across the country, going to school,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>trying to find my path and move for
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ward. My father is married again, and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>he and I have a kind of truce. He is no
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>longer openly angry at me for the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>things I said and did to him when I was
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>flipping out&quot;—things like bringing
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>men to his house and threatening him:
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>You’re gonna pay for what you did to
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>me, Daddy. And once when he tried
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to put me out of my grandmother&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>house, saying, “Youre not going to hide
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>behind my mother, I shouted, “You
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>hid behind mine. Then I ran and got
			</p>
			<pb n='59'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a knife because he lunged for me with
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>such intense anger that I feared for my
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>safety. It was ugly— abysmally, eternal-
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ly ugly.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>As strange as this might sound, I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>would like to make some kind of peace
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>with him before he dies —for myself
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>so I won’t have to suffer guilt pains.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Yet this rage holds me back. My sense
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of justice demands some kind of apol
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ogy, or at least an acknowledgment of
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the deliberate disruption of my life.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>my past with seem to think I exagger

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>bility for my confusion about sex. One
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lover told me that what happened
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>wasn’t such a big deal; after all, the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>man had just lost his wife, he only had
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>one leg, etc., etc. But my confusion is
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>real and ever-present. To me, men
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>seem a breed of aliens. Not only do I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>not understand them, but I am terri

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my behavior insists they prove their

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>am right —they are all corrupt. I don&apos;t

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>may conclude that although sex is

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N001'/>This article was derived from a series of conversations we entertained for many months. Through it, we wish to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N002'/>illuminate both our common and different relationship to a feminist movement to which we are both committed.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N003'/>The Critique
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N004'/>In terms of sexual issues, it seems feminism has fallen short of its original intent. The whole notion of “the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N005'/>personal is political” which surfaced in the early part of the movement (and which many of us have used to an
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N006'/>extreme) is suddenly and ironically dismissed when we begin to discuss sexuality. We have become a relatively
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N007'/>sophisticated movement, so many women think they now have to have the theory before they expose the experi
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N008'/>ence. It seems we simply did not take our.feminism to heart enough. This most privatized aspect of ourselves, our
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N009'/>sex lives, has dead-ended into silence within the feminist movement.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N010'/>Feminism has never directly addressed women’s sexuality except in its most oppressive aspects in relation to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N011'/>men (e.g., marriage, the nuclear family, wife battering, rape, etc.). Heterosexuality is both an actual sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N012'/>interaction and a system. No matter how we play ourselves out sexually, we are all affected by the system inasmuch
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N013'/>as our sexual values are filtered through a society where heterosexuality is considered the norm. It is difficult to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N014'/>believe that there is anyone in the world who hasn’t spent some time in great pain over the choices and limitations
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N015'/>which that system has forced on all of us. We all suffer from heterosexism every single day (whether we’re con
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N016'/>scious of it or not). And as long as that’s true, men and women, women and women, men and men — all different
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N017'/>kinds of sexual combinations — must fight against this system, if we are ever going to perceive ourselves as sexually
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N018'/>profitable and loving human beings.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N019'/>By analyzing the institution of heterosexuality through feminism, we learned what’s oppressive about it and why
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N020'/>people cooperate with it or don’t, but we didn’t learn what’s sexual. We don’t really know, for instance, why men
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N021'/>and women are still attracted to each other, even through all that oppression, which we know to be true. There is
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N022'/>something genuine that happens between heterosexuals, but which gets perverted in a thousand different ways.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N023'/>There is heterosexuality outside of heterosexism.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N024'/>What grew out of this kind of “non-sexual” theory was a “transcendent” definition of sexuality where lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N025'/>ism (since it exists outside the institution of heterosexuality) came to be seen as the practice of feminism. It set up a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N026'/>perfect” vision of egalitarian sexuality, where we could magically leap over our heterosexist conditioning into
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N027'/>mutually orgasmic, struggle-free, trouble-free sex. We feel this vision has become both misleading and damaging
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N028'/>to many feminists, but in particular to lesbians. Who created this sexual model as a goal in the first place? Who
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N029'/>can really live up to such an ideal? There is little language, little literature that reflects the actual sexual struggles
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N030'/>of most lesbians, feminist or not.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N031'/>The failure of feminism to answer all the questions regarding women, in particular women’s sexuality, is the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N032'/>same failure the homosexual movement suffers from around gender. It’s a confusing of those two things— that
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N033'/>some of us are both female and homosexual —that may be the source of some of the tension between the two
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N034'/>movements and of the inadequacies of each. When we walk down the street, we are both female and lesbian. We
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N035'/>are working-class white and working-class Chicana. We are all these things rolled into one and there is no way to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N036'/>eliminate even one aspect of ourselves.

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>about sexuality is its so enormous in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>our culture that people don’t have any
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>genuine sense of dimension. So that
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>when you say capture, every fantasy
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you’ve ever heard of from Robin Hood
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to colonialism comes racing into your
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>mind and all you really maybe wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to do was have your girlfriend lay you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>down.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>But in feminism, we can’t even ex
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>plore these questions because what
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>they say is, in gender, there is a mascu
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>line oppressor and a female oppressee.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>So whether you might fantasize your
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>self in a role a man might perform or a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>woman in reaction to a man, this
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>makes you sick, fucked-up, and you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>had better go and change it.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>If you don’t speak of fantasies, they
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>become a kind of amorphous thing
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that envelops you and hangs over your
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>relationship and you get terrified by
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the silence. If you have no way to de
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>scribe what your desire is and what
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>your fear is, you have no way to nego-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tiate with your lover. And I guarantee
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>you, six months or six years later, the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>relationship has paid. Things that are
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>kept private and hidden become pain
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ful and deformed.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>When you say that part of your sex
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>uality has been hooked up with cap
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ture, I want to say that absolutely
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>there&apos;s a heterosexist part of that, but
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>what part of that is just plain dealing
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>with power, sexually? I don’t want to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>live outside of power in my sexuality,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>but I don’t want to be trapped into a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>heterosexist concept of power either.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>But what I feel feminism asks of me is
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to throw the baby out with the bath-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>water.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>For example, I think the reason
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>butch/femme stuff got hidden within
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>lesbian-feminismis because people are
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>profoundly afraid of questions of pow

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>doesn’t play out power the way I do,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the question of power affects who and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>how you eroticize your sexual need.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>And it is absolutely at the bottom of all
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sexual inquiry. I can&apos;t say to you, for
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>instance, I am trying to work through
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bein a femme, so I won&apos;t have to be

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>CM: But what is femme to you? I told
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you once that what I thought of as
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>femme was passive, unassertive, etc.,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and you didn’t fit that image. And you

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in a butch/femme exchange. I never

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>outside of those roles. Femme is active,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>not passive. It’s saying to my partner.

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>are in control.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>It’s hard to talk about things like
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>giving up power without it sounding
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>passive. I am willing to give myself
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>over to a woman equal to her amount
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>of wanting. I expose myself for her to

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>to see what’s possible for her to love in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>me that’&apos;s female. I want her to respond

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>active with my body, but more eroti-

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to communicate that desire.. And
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>yet, there’s a part of me that feels
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>maybe all this is not even a question of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>roles. Maybe it’s much richer territory

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_8_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Remember I told you how when I

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>making love to her (I was actually just
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>kissing her breast at the moment), but
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>when I looked up at her face, I could
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>feel and see how deeply every part of
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her was present? That every pore in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her body was entrusting me to handle
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>her to take care of her sexual desire.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>This look on her face is like nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>else. It fills me up. She entrusts me to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>determine where she’ll go sexually.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>And I honestly feel a power inside me
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>strong enough to heal the deepest

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hands when I look the way you de
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>scribed. When I open myself up more
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and more to her sensation of wanting a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>woman, when I eroticize that in her, I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>feel a kind of ache in my body, but it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>not an ache to do something. I can feel
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>a hurt spot and a need and it&apos;s there
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and it&apos;s just the tip of it, the tip of that
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>desire and that is what first gets played
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>with, made erotic. It’s light and play
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ful. It doesn’t commit you to exposing
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>a deeper part of yourself sexually.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Then I begin to pick up passion. And
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the passion isn&apos;t butch or femme. It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>just passion.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>But from this place, if it&apos;s working,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I begin to imagine myself being the

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>That’s what I begin to eroticize. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>what I begin to feel from my lover&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>hands. I begin to fantasize myself be
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>coming more and more female in or
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>der to comprehend and meet what I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>feel happening in her body. I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>want her not to be female to me. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>need is female, but it&apos;s butch because I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>am asking her to expose her desire
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>through the movement of her hands on
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>my body and l’II respond. I want to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>give up power in response to her need.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>his can feel profoundly powerful and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>very unpassive.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>A lot of times how I feel it in my

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>can feel the need painfully in another

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and I begin to play and respond to that
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>hunger and desire. And I begin to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>eroticize the fantasy that she can’t get
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>enuf of me. It makes me want to en
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>flame my body. What it feels like is
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>that l’m in my own veins and l’m send
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>ing heat up into my thighs. It’s very

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>AH: Yes, and I am making every part

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sion. I can hear her. It’s like a sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>language; it’s a rhythmic language
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that she uses her hands for. My body is
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>completely in sync with a lover, but
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>l’m not deciding where she’s gonna

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>identity to that other place. That’s why
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>roles are so significant and you can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>throw them out. You have to find a

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N036'/>I just go to the bars and fuck like a
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N037'/>rabbit with women who want me. You

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N040'/>feminism was so invested in that? They
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N041'/>would not examine sexual need with

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N044'/>were always the victim. Even if you
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N045'/>were the aggressor. So how do dykes fit
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N046'/>into that? Dykes who wanted tits, you
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N047'/>know?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N048'/>Now a lot of women have been sex

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N051'/>explicit sexuality, but they made men
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N052'/>out of every sexual dyke. “Oh my god,

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N054'/>So it became this really repressive

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N056'/>and you didn’t want dirty. It really be

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>school, I knew I wasn’t going to see her
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>for months! We had hugged good-bye
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and I went straight home. Going into
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>my bedroom, I got into my unmade
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>bed and I remember getting the sheets,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>winding them into a kind of rope, and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>pulling them up between my legs and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>just holding them there under my chin.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I just sobbed and sobbed because I
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>knew I couldn’t have her, maybe never
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>have a woman to touch. It&apos;s just pure
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>need and it’s whole. It’s like using sex

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>need/want intimacy, passion, love.

				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_2' n='N002'/>We would like to suggest that, in terms of dealing with sexual issues both personally and politically, women
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_3' n='N003'/>go back to CR groups. We believe that women must create sexual theory in the same way we created feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_4' n='N004'/>theory. We need to simply get together in places where people agree to suspend their sexual values, so that all of us
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_5' n='N005'/>can feel free to say what we do sexually or want to do or have done to us. We do have fear of using feelings as
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_6' n='N006'/>theory. We do not mean to imply that feelings are everything. They can, however, be used as the beginning to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_7' n='N007'/>form a movement which can politically deal with sexuality in a broad-based, cross-cultural way
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_8' n='N008'/>We believe our racial and class backgrounds have a huge effect in determining how we perceive ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_9' n='N009'/>sexually. Since we are not a movement that is working-class-dominated or a movement that is Third World, we
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_10' n='N010'/>both hold serious reservations as to how this new CR will be conceived. In our involvement in a movement largely
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_11' n='N011'/>controlled by white middle-class women, we feel that the values of their cultures (which may be more closely tied
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_12' n='N012'/>to an American-assimilated puritanism) have been pushed down our throats. The questions arise then: Whose
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_13' n='N013'/>feelings and whose values will be considered normative in these CR groups? If there is no room for criticism in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_14' n='N014'/>sexual discussion around race and class issues, we foresee ourselves being gut-checked from the beginning.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_15' n='N015'/>We also believe our class and racial backgrounds have a huge effect in determining how we involve ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_16' n='N016'/>politically. For instance, why is it that it is largely white middle-class women who form the visible leadership in the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_17' n='N017'/>anti-porn movement? This is particularly true in the Bay Area, where the focus is less on actual violence against
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_18' n='N018'/>women and more on sexist ideology and imagery in the media. Why are women of color not particularly visible
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_19' n='N019'/>in this sex-related single-issue movement? It’s certainly not because we are not victims of pornography.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_20' n='N020'/>More working-class and Third World women can be seen actively engaged in sex-related issues that directly
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_21' n='N021'/>affect the life-and-death concerns of women (abortion, sterilization abuse, health care, welfare, etc.). It’s not like
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_22' n='N022'/>we choose this kind of activism because it’s an “ideologically correct” position, but because we are the ones preg-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_23' n='N023'/>nant at 16 (straight and lesbian), whose daughters get pregnant at 16, who get left by men without childcare, who
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_24' n='N024'/>are self-supporting lesbian mothers with no childcare, and who sign forms to have our tubes tied because we can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_25' n='N025'/>read English. But these kinds of distinctions between classes and colors of women are seldom absorbed by the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_26' n='N026'/>feminist movement as it stands to date.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_27' n='N027'/>Essentially, we are challenging other women and ourselves to look where we haven’t (this includes through
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_28' n='N028'/>and beyond our class and color) in order to arrive at a synthesis of sexual thought that originates and develops
				<lb facs='#facs_64_region_1697481330917_62_tl_29' n='N029'/>from our varied backgrounds and experiences. We refuse to be debilitated one more time around sexuality, race,

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a good breeder. Large-boned women

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>rights, feelings, or thoughts about how
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>they were being treated. So if a white
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>man wanted sex with a slave, he just
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>took it. She was supposed to be “ready
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>at all times. This “taking” from a

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>and continues even today. That is why
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the belief historically from whites is
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>that Black women can’t be raped. How
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>can it be considered rape or sexual

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Old myths have a tendency to endure.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Our puritan era in Amerika left
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>legacies about women that have been
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>well preserved. The pure white woman
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was not supposed to have sex to enjoy
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>it, but was expected to just lie there
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and pray for it all to be over soon. So,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>for wild sex and pleasure, the white
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>male either went to a house of ill
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>repute (which costs money) or, better
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>still, to the slave quarters. There he
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>could choose from among many young
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>slaves with whom to engage in fun sex.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>If we go even further back to a time
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in Africa before we were captured, it is
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>possible to speculate about the origins
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of a few other stereotypes. For the most
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>part, the continent of Africa is hot,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>especially on the West Coast. When
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>whites landed there, they observed
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Africans going about their everyday
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>activities with a minimal amount of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cloth covering their bodies. Europeans
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>were fully dressed in shoes, socks,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>pants, shirts, and sometimes even
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>jackets. Since Europeans were used to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>so much clothing, looking at Africans
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>made them think of them as sexually
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>loose. After all, women were bare
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>breasted and children ran around
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>nude. Nudity and promiscuity were
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>equated. Also, as recently stated in
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Essence, Africans handled the know
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ledge of sexuality with their children
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and villagers in a non-restrictive man
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ner:
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Nowhere is traditional Africa’s casual
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ness toward sex more manifest than in
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>its attitudes toward nudity. Africans
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>prefer not to be encumbered by cloth
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ing beyond that which is necessary in
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>a hot humid climate. Both boys and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>girls walk about naked and become
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>familiar with genitals as they work, sit,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>bathe or relieve themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>From our African culture I can see
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>other stereotypes that emerged, such
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>as that about Black sexual prowess and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>the many forms that this takes. When
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>whites went to Africa, they did not
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>understand our language, culture
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>rituals, or sexual behavior. So they
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>generalized about African sexual be
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>havior based on the tribal nations that
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>they were observing. Thus, we have
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>stereotyped information that is dis

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>and females have to stop playing the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>game of “who’s the most oppressed” or
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>who’s oppressing whom. Black wom-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>en sometimes claim that the brothers
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>are not sensitive, too rough, just in the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>relationship for the sex, playing around
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>with other women too much, etc.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>Black men sometimes claim that the

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>soft and lady-like, only thinks about
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>money, etc. According to the realities
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>of their lives, they’re both probably
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>right. My concern is to help iron out
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>these conflicts. In order to do that we
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>need to look at the totality of our
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>sexuality—Africa, slavery, poverty,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>urbanization, stereotypes, attitudes,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>behavior, everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>One of the dangers that hangs over
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>our heads is our inability to honestly
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>discuss these matters with one another.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>Our negative images come from a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>place where we learned to take, fight,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>and show little emotion. As Yvonne
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>Flowers says, “One of our legacies from
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>slavery is beatings and physical abuse.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>We were whipped to make us work and

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>out of the closet.” 2
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>Black mothers did not school Black
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>women as to what to look out for with
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>men. How could they if they in some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>ways did not know how to explain it?
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>So it was left unsaid. Our learning was
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>through experience and mistakes. The
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>only times I got some information
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>about men from my elders was when
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>they were talking in the kitchen and I
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>was not supposed to listen. I’d hear
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>things like “men aren&apos;t shit, “those

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N061'/>reference to women. If a Black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N062'/>followed the ethics of the puritan

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Consequently, internalizing these

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>suffer greatly. When a young girl holds

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>etc. There is obviously something
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wrong with her. When Black lesbians

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>oppressive stereotypes.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>When Black women started talking

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>found out a whole lot of shit. The first
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>sigh of relief came when we realized
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that the problems we faced in our
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>sexual lives were not restricted to just
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>us. Black men need to do this with
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>We need to identify which prob-

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>and used in my work is designed to

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>and other sex, and to images about us.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>One of the activities in this test is to

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>they both laughed. As I walked on,
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>thought about our brief interaction.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>began to question why I see so many

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>began to flood my mind. Do lesbian

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>My basic premise is that the climate

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>invisibility appears to be even more

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>herself without a women’s center that

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Racism extends beyond individual

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>perpetuate Black women’s oppression.

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Years ago, a couple of weeks after I decided to append the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>word “lesbian&quot; to my identity, I met a lesbian from another
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>town in Wisconsin who asked if l’d like to spend a weekend
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with her. I jumped at the chance: lesbians in Green Bay
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>were (are?) very secretive and I hadn’t found any yet. When
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I showed up the following Friday, one of her first comments
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was, &quot;I hope you didn’t get the idea that we were going to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sleep together.&quot; That was my first case of unrequited lust.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Perhaps since I never read anything in the “teenage ro
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>mance” genre, I managed to escape the goal of love and
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>marriage as an adult. Coming out in Wisconsin, my first
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>experience of other lesbian lifestyles was the obsessive desire
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>not to let anyone know. Having also seemingly escaped much
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of the programming about how bad it was to be homosexual,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>my first glimpse of the closeted mentality was from the out
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>side. Ever since, I have been fascinated with watching lesbi
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ans who structure their lives so that the only difference be
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tween them and their neighbors is their choice of partner.

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>may perhaps argue the validity of this premise politically, it
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>appears that many lesbians live highly successful lives (by
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>their own assessment) by making that one change in sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>preference, and then closing the door on further tampering
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with society’s expectations. In fact, all of us stop tampering
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>at some point: it is impossible to exist solely in a vortex. It
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>appears, however, that most lesbian-feminists have preferred
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>not to admit that they have, indeed, stopped short of con
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>fronting sexual change.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Every lesbian knows that it is her sexual preference that
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>makes her “different.” However, our male-dominated soci

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>was that women had been programmed not to expect or
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>gasms, not to expect pleasure from sexual relationships.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>While it was eminently clear that Woman’s energy had been

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Charming was supposed to sweep us off our feet. Now Prin
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cess Charming may do the same. In either case, the process
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>is one of objectifying one’s lover into a projection of pieces of
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>oneself. Because we have projected ourselves onto the lover,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the lover then becomes necessary for self-esteem. This is ex
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>actly the sequence patriarchal society expects of its partici
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>pants: women project their strength onto their men; men
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>project their emotions onto their women. From the woman&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>perspective, it is only possible to feel powerful through one’s
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>partner. Furthermore, since women’s sexuality had to be
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>controlled (for patrilineal purposes), the easy solution was to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>use the sex = love equation.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>She stood at the edge of the party’s conversation group. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>face, while impassive, was notable because of the spark in
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>her eyes as she watched the other women. I was awed by the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>fireworks display. A voice inside said, “Get to know her; she
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>will be very important in your life.” But is this lust or is this

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>went mad or died prematurely, it read like a Candy Striper

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>labyrises and women’s symbols —is not an especially health

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that good sex is an intense form of communication. The
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>power of sexuality— recognized for centuries by occultists
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>is overwhelming to some. Furthermore, the words and con

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>etc. — convey a power which has been essentially ignored in
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>most feminist discussions. Rather than confront the reality
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of this power, many have opted for the traditional (meaning
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>imposed) women’s solution: it’s all right if it’s with someone
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>you love. There is an implicit assumption that as long as
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>trust and caring are present, then everything’s okay. While
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sex with a loved one may be desirable, it is not necessary.

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>watering holes! But there was a new problem. While the

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>by then, one was still not supposed to objectify one’s sisters.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>As a political junkie, my lifestyle got raised eyebrows at best
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>—especially when I insisted on using words like “trick” at
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lesbian-feminist meetings.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>It is important to realize that projection onto the loved
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>one is objectification. The love object —the solution to one’s
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>needs — blinds us to the possibility of relating to the lover as
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>she really is. The objectification of True Love is no less
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tyrannical than the classic “male” objectification of Woman
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>as Tits-n-Ass. However, since it is always easier to see others
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>problems, we as feminists become obsessed with Tits-n-Ass
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>objectification by men, without seeing our own objectifica

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Why is it that no one objects if one chooses to limit a re

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>have sex with her? I would submit that the view that sex is sc

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>al society. Is one activity really more objectifying than the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>activity is something that both enjoy sharing with the other?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>A portion of the romantic myth is based on the idea that

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>satisfactory life by partitioning one’s emotional and sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>life among a number of people can be very frightening.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>While most lesbians would admit that it is okay, possibly de

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of friends, it is harder for many to accept the corollary that
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>one can do the same with one’s sex life. This attitude makes
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>it difficult for the woman to find any positive value in ex

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>new issues to express through her sexuality. This, I believe, is
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the reason that some lesbian-feminists have trashed or cen
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sored other lesbians who have tried to address lesbian sexu
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ality in new ways. I remember in particular the scathing
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>personal attack in Big Mama Rag on Tee Corinne’s talk/

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>summer of 1979. Witness more recently the vehement (or
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>should I say violent) reaction to the open discussion of lesbi
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>an S/M. Could it be that some lesbians are afraid to really
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>confront the taboo of woman enjoying —and defining—sex?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The ultimate question, I believe, lies in what one wants
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>to get out of sex. If one views sex as only a means of express
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ing love, then loveless sex is meaningless. However, this is
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>not the only view possible. To me, sex is an expression of an
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>affinity with another person, and that affinity can exist on
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>only one or on many levels.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I was furious with her for what she was saying at the Coali-
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tion meeting. Half-baked political statements, dropped with
				<lb facs='#facs_83_l' n='N031'/>a sprinkling of and (**STAR**) says. We went out
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>drinking afterwards and argued for another few hours. We
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>closed the bar, and went to my apartment to continue talk
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>ing. Soon we were kissing instead, embracing, then pulling
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>each other’s clothes off. Is this lust or is this love? Do I care?!!
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>Change is a stressful process. Sex is one field of experience
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>in which all feminists must change, because there has been
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>such neglect of our sexuality in the past. It is important that
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>we be open to new models of behavior, and not be too quick
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>to dismiss what at first may not seem to fit our political ex
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>pectations.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>And this brings us back to lust. Lust as an expression of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>sexual desire can represent an affirmation of our collective
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>right to unfettered, unguilty, undefined sexuality. It is an

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I began to see the cookies pushing out of a wall of molten
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>fudge, sensuous mounds of thick heavy fudge. What was I to
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>do? Working intuitively, accepting the cookies, reaffirmed
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>me as never before. Painting them gave me pleasure. I felt
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>calm at work, with long attention spans. When I stopped,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I felt satisfied and happy. My body told me so. I was tapping
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>my own deep reserves. My life already felt changed. So I
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>waited, content to paint cookies and think about fudge.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>One day I whipped up Ivory Snow Flakes. The soap
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>peaked and made luscious mounds. They stood firm with
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>taut edges. Quickly I put the suds on a board and slipped the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>cookies in. They held there balanced in the soap. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>beautiful, but it just wasn’t right. It was okay, but I felt
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>disturbed. I wanted something more, something with more
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>body. Something I could really move and get into...plaster!
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Yes. Yes! I had some. I got a pot, a bucket, water and set to
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>mix. Oh, I could feel it slipping over my hands, circling
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>around my fingers. It thickened and grew heavier, clinging
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to my fist. I waited for the right touch before pouring. My
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>stars, my floors! I was unprepared. I had to get some plastic,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>a box, towels, clean water. I ran around grabbing things
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>rushing to get back to my work site. I was afraid the plaster
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>might harden. Not a moment too soon. Pour. The bucket
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>was heavy to lift. I worried the whole thing might fall apart.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>I took a deep breath, exhaling, letting the plaster go. It fel
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>well. I thought I sang, but I had no time to think. I picked
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>up a bunch of cookies. One by one I pushed them into the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>plaster. Green, push scoop. Grey, push scoop. Lavender.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>push scoop, push scoop. The plaster got harder. Plunge
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>twist, twist, till no more would go with discretion.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Dazed, I stared at what I made. My body flashed heat.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>The sculpture there, its sight in my mind imprints overlays,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>registered and connected. It was the image that sparked the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>orgasm. The thought of those beautiful circles slipping in
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and out of their matrix. I came upon the creation of my
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>pleasuring and joy. The kitchen happening was brought
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>back again by making the sculpture.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I was eager to understand how and what I was thinking.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>It seemed to secure a transformative power intrinsically
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>connected to my coming out. That process of our sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>revolution that individualizes and stands us apart. I had
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>always known I loved women, but coming to terms with
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>myself, the culture and countercultures around me, took
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>time and patience. The give and take of the sculpture
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>showed me a way. Visualizing the cookies in my mind,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>making the choice of materials, and placing each cookie into
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the plaster were activities beyond the psychic and cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>censorship that normally tempered my thinking. I came into
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>contact with my own desires.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Within this state of eroticism lay an incredible strength.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I realized I was the only person responsible for my sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>excitement. Further, it gave me an experience of independ
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ence. It was a powerful vision. I stood alone and it scared
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>me. My images came back terrifying and bloody, threatened
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>by my independence; I was ready to call myself back.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Instead of being overwhelmed by anxiety and fear, I held to
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the confidence gained by the cookies experience. I found
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>myself free to voice my confidence and pleasure as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>fear and terror. I made plaster cakes that consisted of shards
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of mirror, little animals, broken, being engulfed by plaster,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sliding to oblivion; or another cake with garishly painted
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>animal cracker cookies surrounding, taunting, one
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>screaming red-mouthed bear at the center.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>By placing myself and intimate glimpses of my imagina
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tion into my work, the body of sculpture I made gave me the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>opportunity to speak out, accept as my own, make art for
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and from all the voices within me. Face to face with the body
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of work I could give them their due. With practice I could
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>connect concrete events and feelings that keyed off the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>images. Knowing this I could separate and demystify them.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the things that concerned me led me to understand a per
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sonal limit to my terror in both inward and outward acts of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>violence. The primacy of their existence relied on the fact of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>created and sustained dependence, possession bound by a
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>net of forgetfulness and a promise of power. It required I
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>silence my own needs, be unresponsive, deadened to my own
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>injury and anger. It consistently fed an undercurrent of fail
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ure that twisted my ideas of pleasuring, combining them
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>with hatred. Until now. I saw myself in place, unguarded,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>my memory acute. Resolved: to make myself responsive and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>responsible. Situations of power and powerlessness became
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>nudged with the recognition of change.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Alternatives and choices came over a longer period of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>time. The cookies model held within its context the idea and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>action of self-reliance. It was based on the constant utiliza
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tion of my own resources. It gave a growing sense of security
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that was not easily undermined. The images were my
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>immediate response to a given situation. I was learning to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>respect their value. From them I made art that was clearly
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>my own. It was a willing tapping and response of my reason
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing abilities. This touching, testing, and reassuring allowed
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>me to place myself closer and closer to intimate spaces,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>deeply personal places with unique perspectives. Places
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>where I could stand supported by my own effort and come
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>away with a sense of dignity, grace, and power. It took con
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>scious, imagined, and practiced effort.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>As the image and art-making phase of my life grew I
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>began to take notice of this peculiar awareness during love
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>making. I would remember small patches. It was like waking
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>up from a dream thinking how clear and important it was,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>but immediately being unable to remember the dream or
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>what it meant. Cookies and milk flew out from an incredible
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>core source. It seemed ultimately important to see my sex,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>my sensual and loving senses within the same state of eroti
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>cism. I was eager to make love to women who shared this
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>same sense of personal power and autonomy.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We have been lovers for about four or five months; we
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>share the same loft. It’s difficult for me to share the space.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>It’s hard to keep my mind on drawing when there are other
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sounds and movements. I turn and watch her working or
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>walking getting supplies. My work time wears down; I look
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>at her more and more. Sometimes it is her face. I remember
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>seeing it tensed or relaxed as we talked and made decisions
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>together. Many times it is her behind and inseam. It’s those
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>damned Levi’s. I know why she likes them. They fit her so
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>well. Low on her hips, that fold of material at the cross of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her thighs.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I give up trying to work. I keep thinking about her
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>T-shirt, how it falls loose off her nipples. Or how her back
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>muscles tense and swell as she rolls up ink at the workshop. I
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>walk by her a couple of times to get a closer look. Wrist,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>elbow, ear, brown spot beauty mark. Ink on her cheek. I
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>stroke her stomach, but she wants to work. It isn’t until
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>much later, an Ironsides, MASH, Jokers Wild and Bowling
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>for Dollars later, that we both get a little buzzy.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>She is standing at her drawing desk. She smiles. She
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>walks over and cups her body with mine. I hold her for
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>awhile; she turns and begins kissing my neck, face, mouth.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>We kiss until my knees drop me to the studio floor. I search
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>for the nub of her jeans. I smell for it, grabbing it with my
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>teeth. The denim is harsh, the zippers cold metal in my
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mouth. I adjust my grip and pull her with my teeth; drag
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ging her growling and laughing, sliding her over the floor.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Her legs lock over my back. She tries smothering my face
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with my shirt. My saliva soaks through her jeans. I won’t give
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>up my hold, she hers. Laughing, we move to the bed without
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>letting go. We undress each other as we stumble up the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ladder, fighting to get there first. Stubbing toes, bumping
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>knees in the rush.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Once there we slow. Wrapped under covers we caress.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Warm exchanges pass through us. My hands, my tongue,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>reach out to her breast and inner hip. To her back and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>shoulder blades, to the nape of her neck, to her clavicle,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>back down to her nipple. Sometimes she sucks and bites on
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>my breast. We take our time. Her hands kneading me.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Rubbing me. Me needing deep muscle relaxation. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>touch excites me. My touch excites me. My vulva grows fat;
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>my vagina gradually loosens. Slowly the concentration builds
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>a series of shimmers within me; happy, my cunt shakes them
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>out in small concentric bands. Each section I open, wet a

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>urges me on to more movement. I find myself biting her ass,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>sucking in each cheek, gliding my spit into her asshole. She
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>turns and my teeth rub her hip. Up and down, up and down,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>sliding to her belly, nose first to the button, my chin bristling
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>on her hair. I listen to myself breathing. Going layers down.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Then a snap; tension gone. A breakthrough. One of many.

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>between us. In a second we begin. I turn it on low. The
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>vibrations make us giggle. A goofy sort of feeling, almost too
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>strong too soon. It feels like it will open our bellies. We keep
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>losing our breath until we channel the flow. Then sighs,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>breaths, sighs. Slowly sliding to the right, no, too quick.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Nudging gently to the center, no not there. Over slowly to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the left. A spark, yes, but oh, too strong; it’s gone.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Moving our hips in lighter motions, we look for that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>spark, that tension, that pinch of response. In an all-around
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>body wrap we fit snug, thighs, feet, stomachs, breasts, face
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to face. Seeking pleasure in the unity of motion. My muscles
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>stutter as the passage widens. We work each shudder,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>smoothing it from a lump, a bump, to a lengthening wave.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Reuniting the thread of cell to cell relay. Smiling, I feel my
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>body respond to my lover’s changes. Intrigued by our body
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>commands, we grasp, suspend, release, spiral, let go. Waves
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of heat lift my hair. From my middle light and space. A
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Fallopian twist and twinge skirt my interior. Colors encour
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>age me. Pictures seduce me. Then they are gone. I relax
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>breathe again. Images roll. Music. Dancing shoes rocking
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>revolving. Fish sing winking their eyes and turn into houses
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and rooms. Ecstasy. Hats high-step with pearls and opals
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Parades of buttons wearing Minnie Mouse gloves and shoes
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>sing just a few words. I keep repeating it; then it is over. I
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>want more. There’s a place l’ve been. I know it. Knowing it,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>I have to go on.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>I move off her body. I massage her and stretch her legs,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>rubbing sweat off her stomach. I spread her tangled hair
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>my fingers monitor the channel. That touch, her wet and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>open, loosens a knot in my wrist that snaps to my elbow,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>whizzes through my shoulder, and wakes a space behind my
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>right ear.. my eye startled. My mouth ooohs. I watch her as
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>I slip the dildo in, small nuzzles at first. She arches, lifts.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>“Take it out a little.”“Okay, how about here.”“Yes, better,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>good. What about you?”“Yes, soon.” I know I have to be
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>careful. She and I work swiftly. I am so wet I lose my grin
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>stabilize, and suddenly it’s in me too. A voluptuous body
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>response. I almost let go. We waver, not quite ready for
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>movement. We wait for the intensity to subside. We kiss
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>again, deep in behind rough edges on teeth into soft gums
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Mouths open sucking tongues out their length. Their rough
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ness tempered by spit, their underneath slick as they turn
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>against each other. Carol swings her head. I grip an earlobe
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>humming in her ear. She counters, squish wriggling her
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tongue a total sound in my ear. Goose bumps haze me. My
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>heart takes leave of me. I feel its hot place in my chest. I am
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>suspended in the wait of its return. A few moments pass, it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>back. Its journey now a message in my own body language,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Speaks passing on a beat report beat. Her body lifts to mine.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I pass the movement back. I grip her throat in my teeth.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Gently drawing my mouth closed as I lift off, letting go as I
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>leave her, trailing off, feeling my teeth dry against her skin.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Lost until the first wave hits me hard. Wrenched, warped
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>until it eases its spell. It too spreads its story. Its language I
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>barely understand, but care, desire to follow.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I curl my legs around, spread wide on top of her. Re
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>membering ribbon or colored nylon rappeling line. Think
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing of it as part of my vagina, circling through, right near
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the edge. Tugging it, loosening it, widening it, tugging it,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>closed again. Feeling the strength of its connection to my
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>clitoral pulse. That hard bead, that one point taking shape,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>spreading pleasure, filling every nook and cranny my mind
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and body can create. We work hard. Muscles gather tight-
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ened, my breath far from slow delirium. Crunching, bone
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>jerking movement, patterned, patterned over and over
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>again. Tensed to slow motion, trying to hear. Voices I have
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>waited for so long in silence. I am here. Yes, I am here, I
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>am ready. I am here. It is time. My body snaps, stiffens,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>convulses, screams yodeling yes. Voices come alive. God
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>mothers gossips all. I spin. It is wonderful. Yahooing, hoot
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ing. My body shakes with pleasure. Orbiting. Laughing,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>feeling my strength. The centrifugal pull, hair flowing,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>lungs screaming, legs moving running streaming whirling.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>All of me joined together, reaching a place so clean it has a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>rich moist growing smell.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Slowed, my heart beat wavers, my breath rasps to sighs,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>my blood simmers and levels. I stand alone, curious. I settle
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to the ground. Thinking of the dimensions of this place. I
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>walk for a while. I wander through the city exhilarated by its
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>beauty. Soothed and open I feel a familiar peace. The
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>orgasm wanes. I find a mound I like. It is covered with deep
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>grass. I lie down comfortable on its springiness. It smells of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>rich earth. I think: things grow well here.

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It took me almost forty years of at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tempts at erotic fulfillment to find out
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that my sexuality remained at a stage
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>short of the kind considered normal on
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>genital. My whole body remained open
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and waiting like a wound; my genital
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>parts were only two folds among many,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>rather like a fabric unrolling to wel
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>come those whom I loved. I uncoverec
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>what made my sexuality what it is as I
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>looked back at the story of my love of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>fabrics and as I looked at my quilts.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>When I was a child, in the early
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>thirties in Bulgaria, there were no
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ready-made clothes. Every year, in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>early spring, a seamstress came to our
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>house to do the sewing for everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>but my father (he had his tailor in the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>center of town).
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>I both loved and hated the times
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the seamstress was there. The chil
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dren’s room was turned into her work
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>room. The decisions about the colors
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and styles were made by my mother
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and sister; and I was allowed to have
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>my say only about the collar’s shape
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and other small details that did not
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>matter. At the fittings my mother stood
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>closer to me than usual and touched
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>me, or rather, handled the material
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>next to my skin in a sure way as if in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>touching there were no problems ever.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>She came out of her usual remote and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>distracted air, and half-peevishly, half
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>humbly submitted to the final judg
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ments of the seamstress
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The seamstress was very quiet,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dressed in black, completely in charge
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of herself and the situation. She was a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>middle-aged widow, and this called for
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>silence on everybody’s part, and made
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>her work something to be respected on
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>account of death
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>She stayed a week or two working
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>incessantly. She did not come down
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>stairs to eat with us but ate off a plate
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>on top of the sewing machine. She
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>never looked up at anyone or at any
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>thing except her work, and she left,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>half-defiant, half-forlorn, when she
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>was done. In the room there remained
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a faint odor of her sitting there and of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ironed and singed clothes.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>All this seemed close to a miracle to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>me, and she, a kind of higher being.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>She cut the expensive materials with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>out hesitating, never spoiling or wast
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ing anything. She made the patterns
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>herself just by looking at the French
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>magazines my mother held before her
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>with an unsteady hand, and everything
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>fit perfectly. As for my mother, she
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>could sew in straight lines: she mended
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>torn sheets and made pillow cases and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>diapers, but nothing free or in the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>round.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>No electric appliances existed at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the time except the radio, and the sew
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ing machine was kept turning by hand.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It made a sound like a miniature train
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>going places. I imagine that this was

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the womb, while my mother made dia-
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pers as she was waiting for me, just as
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>she later did for my brother. The sew
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ing machine&apos;s motions and its sound I
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>imitated in the bathtub, cutting the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>water into ribbons that rejoined by
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>themselves. I dotted seams with my
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>fingers across the surface and felt the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tub water like a fluid skirt which rip
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>pled round me but did not constrict
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>me. My mother rinsed me afterward.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with water that was regularly too hot. I
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>had attacks of fear that my body would
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>be rinsed away as the water rolled off
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>and down the drain.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>Bathing took place in the evening,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>ostensibly to keep the dirt from getting
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>into the clean bed. But I suspect now it
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>was mainly a substitute for the body
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>contact my mother withheld from me
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>for lack of time, lack of interest, and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>for fear it would spoil me. As usual in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>our prude country at that time, she
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>kept nudity in front of children down
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>to a minimum. Whether for reasons of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>class, or because of her own physical

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>them round her neck and lowered
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>them with a sweep loud enough to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>hear. To give, to make a home for my
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>feelings, any material was good enough
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>but the flesh. Thus the feel of my
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>clothes against my body, the scrutiny
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>of others’ clothes for the bodies be
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>neath them and the contact they
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>promised or forbade, occupied my
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>whole childhood.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>For reasons I shall never under
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>stand, I was allowed to accompany my
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>father to the tailor’s. There I was ex
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>pected to be silent, and I watched all
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>the more avidly, more solemnly than in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>church, one man fit another man into
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>new clothes. The tailor was in shirt
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>sleeves; the tape measure framed his
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>neck and bobbed like a necklace as he
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>moved about. As many others in his
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>trade he had a lame leg, but he hob
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>bled, kneeled down and hopped up
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>briskly as he adjusted the jackets and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>pants being fitted. His face shone with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>something I later recognized as love,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>and it ruled his hands in the form of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>respect and skill, slowing down or
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>speeding up his fingers to straighten
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>here, to smooth down there, to pin the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>material next to my father’s body.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>Materials in salt-and-pepper, in her
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>ring-bone design, in tiny English
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>checks, pin-stripes in dark colors were

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>over the shoulders of my father for him
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>to look at in the daylight and before
			</p>
			<pb n='88'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the mirror for as long as he would have
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it. My father, who generally was on the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>run, there took his time, a long time,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and spoke to the tailor as an equal, as
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>one professional to another, both smil
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing and gesticulating a lot.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>All our clothes were cared for by
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>our maid —washed by hand in the cel
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>lar and ironed in her room (which was
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>next to my parents’ bedroom and with
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>only a locked door between). She got
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>up very early and fell asleep before
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>they did, otherwise she must have
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>heard all. My parents went out a lot in
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the evening, or else they talked late
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>into the night, and this astonished me
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as my mother otherwise talked very
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>little. How the maid figured out what
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to do, with minimum instruction, is a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>mystery to me. She ironed a whole day
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>every week, using an iron that was kept
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>hot by coals. She kept her back turned
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to me as I sat watching on her bed,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and when I held on to her as I had seen
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>her boyfriends do, she shook me off by
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the force of her legs and did not stop
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ironing.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>She ironed her things last, and kept
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>her best blouse out on a hanger till her
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>day off. When she took me along on
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>her dates I saw her clothes getting
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>crumpled and parts of her blouse
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>hanging loosely out in front. The back
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of her friend as he hugged her blocked
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>my view from where I was playing
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Before going home, she pulled her
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>clothes back into place, pressing her
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>hands over them, again and again,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>squeezing herself in place, too,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>straightening everything, smoothing
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>her stockings which had turned around.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Back at home and in bed, my bed
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>covers fell as a curtain between what I
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>had seen outside and myself; they kept
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>in the warmth that rose in waves inside
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>me. The children’s covers were flat,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>lightly stuffed, and quilted in squares
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>by craftsmen who also quilted mat
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tresses and more elaborate comforters
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for adults, which were a bit puffier
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and had running designs with floral
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>curlicues. All the comforters I have
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>seen in our country were done in apri
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cot and rose shades of damask or glazed
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cotton material and were called, and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>still are called, yurgans. They had
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>enough body and thickness to be piled
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and plied so as to give the illusion there
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was someone under the covers even
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>when there was no one underneath.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Thus they were part of many games of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>hide-and-seek and acts of disappear
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ance.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The yurgans of my parents were
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>covered with a fine-meshed crocheted
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>net to keep off the dust. On top of the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>children’s beds there were thin blank
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ets. Since they were difficult to clean,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the yurgans were never to be stepped
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>on or sat on directly. Yet, even though
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>it was forbidden, we sat on the beds
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and jumped up and down till exhaust
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ed. Once it gave me a terrible pain to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>be pressed down on top of a yurgan to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>be fondled. I thought of the yurgan all
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the time and could not stop trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>puff it up again afterwards, even
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>though it was not even ours.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Unless I was late for a meal nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>at home missed me actively except the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>maid, but I never spoke much to her. I
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>did cry when she left to be married.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>She cried only once when my father
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>embraced her after the wedding. She
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>was getting married to a butcher from
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>out-of-town after having taken care of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>my father’s clothes for more than ten
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>years, after his fine pyjamas, shorts,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>shirts, and handkerchiefs had passed
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>through her hands every week and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>come out immaculately clean. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>clear to me that she was saying farewell
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to being close to him, closer than his
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>children ever would be.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>How close my parents were to each
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>other I could not tell. I seldom saw
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>them together except at meals and did
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>not understand what was exchanged.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>But I could watch my mother making
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>up her face. She first used a lot of pow
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>der and lipstick and then patted them
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>off, and plucked her eyebrows lightly.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>I watched the side mirrors, which mul
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>tiplied her face and peopled the alcove
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>in which her dressing table stood with
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>so many images of her that I got dizzy.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>It seemed to me that I was being envel
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>oped, stuck in the tight space created
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>by the play of mirrors round my moth
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>er as I sometimes got stuck in my
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>clothes while dressing, not knowing
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>which way to push through my head or
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>my arms.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>As my mother pulled and closed
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>drawers, unpacked packages, shopped.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>groomed herself and us, managed
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>things in the kitchen, her eyes were
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>always elsewhere than her hands. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>hands looked out of place and never
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>rested in a hold, but fluttered on, in
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and out of bags, shopping nets, gloves.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>baskets, pots and pans. Even though
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>she did not cook day by day, but only
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>helped make the preserves and pickle
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>vegetables for the winter, she never
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>stood still. I saw her rest only when shę
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>watched the icon of the Virgin Mother,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the mother in the icon holding her
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>baby boy sadly, sweetly, eternally, in
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>a restful hold—something my mother
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>denied herself and me.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>My father sometimes allowed me to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>walk a couple of blocks along his side;
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and he did have a free hand to hold
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mine. That was the only part of him I
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>remember being allowed to touch. In
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>side his hand was gentle and warm and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>his fingers were well padded and soft.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>I remember wishing to touch my
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>father’s hair, which was curly and un
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ruly, as I wanted mine to be. His
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>seemed to have a life of its own, from
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the way he tried to hold it in place as
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>he talked on and shook it briskly. The
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>horsehair that regularly stuck out from
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the mattresses had the same sheen and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>spring.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>My hair was the only part of me my
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>mother touched with comfort. She
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>seemed to have trouble getting it
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>combed and spent extra time pinning
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ribbons in it, which always slipped off.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>I rolled and unrolled the ribbons until
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>they would roll back into a curl. My
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>hair was straight and cut short, as my
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>mother considered plaited hair com
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>mon.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Even before I could read I had
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>learned how to knit, but my mother
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>hated hand-knit clothes. She preferred
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>fine, machine-knit English cardigans,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and screened my friends on the basis of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>their woolens. I think she was afraid of

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tables, stoves, with shopping trips in
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>between. Their farthest trips were to

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>rove between waking and sleep, watch

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>behind me, the order of the seams run

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dreams. Crawling out of them in the

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and partly a meditation on all the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>other issues I had neglected. The cloth

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Early feminist art, particularly as it
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>developed on the West Coast, began

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>seen within the context of the then
