				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonty called art can have a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>political impact and that in the making of art and all cuitural artifacts our identities as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women play a distinct role. We hope that Heresies will stimulate dialogue around
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>radical political and aesthetic theory, as well as generate new creative energies among
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>women. It will be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>broadening the definition and function of art e Heresies is published by a collective of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>feminists, some of uhom are also socialists, manists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>our fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>histor, architecture, filmmaking, photography, and video. While the themes of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>individual issues wil be determined by the colective, each issue will have a different
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>editorial staff, composed of members of the mother collective and other women inter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ested in that theme. Heresies provides experience for women uho work editorialiy in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>design, and in production. Heresies willty to be accountable to and in touch with the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>intemational feminist community e As women, we are aware that historicaly the con
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>nections betueen our lives, our arts, and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>connections are clarified, they can function as a means to dissowe the alienation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>betueen artist and audience, and to understand the relationship between at and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>politics, work and workers. As a step toward the demystification of art, we reject the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>standard relationship of criticism to art within the present system, which has often
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>become the relationship ot advertiser to product. We wil not advertise a new set ot

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The Heresies education
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>collective came together at Rutgers University.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Several years have passed since we began work-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ing together, and some of us are no longer con
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>nected with that (or any other) university. We
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>will, however, always be involved with the proc
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ess of learning and will never cease being students
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and teachers.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Initialy we believed that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>working on the Heresies education issue would
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>serve to clarify ideas we had about the neces
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sity (or lack thereof) of formal education and a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>university degree. We were also curious to hear
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>about women’s experiences in other leamning sit
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>uations. Once the collective began to meet, it be
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>came clear that the matter of formal education
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was a secondary one.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Of primary importance,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>it seemed, was the effect of education, both for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>mal and informal. How have we, and all other
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>women, been formed into who we are? What
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>role models have we followed, what constraints
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and freedoms have we been taught? How has
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>what we’ve been taught affected our dreams and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>expectations of what we can hope to achieve in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>our lives? These are some of the questions that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>helped shape this issue of Heresies.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Our collective devel
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>oped a healthy respect for the many scholarly
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>journals we combed for interesting subjects,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>formats, and ideas. Scholars and theoreticians
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>write articles that reflect their years of research.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>University presses and associations (such as the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>College Art Association) provide an enormous
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>service by publishing this work. The women who
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>responded to our call for submissions, however,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>responded not with theoretical material but with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>personal accounts of their own experiences with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>education — formal and otherwise. We found
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that many women responded from the view-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>point of having been miseducated (or myth
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>educated; it seems there are an abundance of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>institutional horror stories to be told). But we
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>also received many stories about learning that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>inspired and uplifted us. In our search for mate

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tenure hearings, lesson plans, and racial and sex

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>offered by society. So I begin with what they care about

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>years, and we could not afford to be at war with them
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>We briefly discussed the upcoming summit between
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>world leaders and decided it was time for a treaty of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>our own. We wrote a lit of grievances, a plea to “stop
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the warring,&quot; and a suggested resolution. It was signed
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>by all and sent to the first/second grade. This impressed
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the first/second grade, and they took up the concerns
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_8_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>of the kindergarteners seriously. They came up with

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>their own list of rules for outside. Then we came to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>gether to exchange treaties and song. It was no cure
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>all; there are still problems of intimidation. But it was
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>an important process in the search for alternatives in

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>It distresses me that we withhold or even lie to chil

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>children and believe the preservation of this innocence
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>will rid the world of its ills. But there is nothing more
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>disillusioning than to discover that the fairy-tale world
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>we’ve encouraged them to construct exists nowhere.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>We should protect children with honest information and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>by installing hope and faith in their ability to act and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>change their world. And there is no preservation of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>innocence; our culture—good and bad—is too em
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>bedded in a child’s every experience. If we don’t pro

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>know these children will be introduced to much of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the mainstream through TV books, and commercial
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ization. So I tend to focus on the forgotten, omitted,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and intentionally distorted histories of our planet.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>We spent most of November confronting the stereo
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>type of the wild Indian. By Thanksgiving I was pleased
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>with how much they’d absorbed when they told the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>story back to me. But because these stories are some
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>times in such conflict with what they’ve been led to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>believe, even at five, they must be introduced and re
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>peated in numerous ways. When a Native American
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>woman from the Speaker’s Bureau came in January,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>they were again doing a reality check. In one of their
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>thank-you’s, a boy asked her, “Did the white people
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>really steal all the land from the Indians?”
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>do not mean to destroy their love for their home
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>land. It was hard to accept that the army had traded
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>smallpox-infected blankets to a tribe with the intention
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that they would all get sick and die. One boy com
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>mented, “Yeah, but they only did that once, right?” They
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>so want to believe in their country, and they should. To
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>me, patriotism requires looking honestly at our actions
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and condemning those acts that threaten our nation&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>professed ideals. We also fortify the children by study
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ing the tradition of resistance, not the injustices alone.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>We learn how this resistance was embodied in the lives
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of Harriet Tubman, Susan B. Anthony, Martin Luther
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>King, Jr., and Malcolm X.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Finally, l am asking the five-year-olds to make a judg-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ment on the basis of empathy, respect, and fact. I can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>deny my influence, that of their parents, the toy manu
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>factures, and the media. However, we must provide
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>opportunities for the kids themselves to exercise their
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ability to assess what is fair, what is right.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>These ideas may be old, but l am saying them again.

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>house, the drilling of basic skills through rote recitation.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>They would have us believe that a highly structured,

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Sunday morning. Only a few people
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>were on the streets. I hoped I wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>get lost. My knuckles and jaws were
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tight.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>I knocked on a door inside a small

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>blonde hair and blue eyes. She smiled
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and said, “Come in. You’re just in time.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>There were several rooms. Leading me
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>into one of them she said, “Make your

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>She told me his name and said they

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>or my nervous stomach.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>heard the entire question. I knew I was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in trouble. My mind began to flash news-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>paper headlines. I racked my brain trying
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to piece together a coherent stream of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ideas. None would come. Despite pa

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>formance was disappointing. Their reali

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>discuss it. We clumsily made a few more

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>back to the streets of Manhattan.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Anger and disappointment welled up.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I walked in a daze. I had traveled ten

			<pb n='32'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>hours to get there. In five minutes I
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>learned what I had suspected all my life
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that my education had prepared me to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>live only in an American “Negro world,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>not “the world.” I felt my first great
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>doubt about why I was studying so hard.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>If all that diligence was not going to pay
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>off, why do it? Feeling alone with the

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>each succeeding encounter would reveal
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>more of my vast ignorance of the white
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>man’s world. This is a story about how
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I was trained to take my American Negro
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>female place.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N017'/>We lived in a state that was ra
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N018'/>cially segregated by law. My
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N019'/>parents, grandparents, aunts,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N020'/>and uncles often spoke quietly about
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N021'/>events. They were afraid something aw-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N022'/>ful would happen to us kids even before
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N023'/>we grew up. As a young black child, be
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N024'/>fore I could even think, I was told how
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N025'/>bad things are out there in the world,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N026'/>how there’s no place for us, how people
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N027'/>don’t like us.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N028'/>Speaking my mind could get me killed.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N029'/>My own thoughts and feelings were sec
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N030'/>ondary. My questions, curiosity, and en
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N031'/>thusiasm had to be bridled. Learning
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N032'/>this would help me survive. I was often
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N033'/>told: “Shut up!”; “Who asked you your
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N034'/>opinion?”; “Who said so?”; “You don’t

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N037'/>They felt that the sooner I learned to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N038'/>speak only when spoken to and to say
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N039'/>no more than I had to, the better it was
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N040'/>going to be for me. It was a fear, a si
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N041'/>lence put into me—and most black
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N042'/>kids—to prepare us, to toughen us up
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N043'/>for the real world like soldiers for war. I
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N044'/>learned to respond with words that had
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N045'/>double meanings and with a rhythm and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N046'/>pace that could change or modify any
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N047'/>message I was trying to get across.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N048'/>Yet my parents had hopes that adult
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N049'/>hood would be better for us than it had
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N050'/>been for them. I was sent to kindergar
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N051'/>ten at age five. The teacher, a friend of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N052'/>my parents, made learning and school
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N053'/>seem like a lot of fun. Because of that I
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>looked forward to attending elementary
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>school, but what I found was incredibly
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>boring. At age six I knew that the teacher,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>who was black, did not care about most
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of us. I can’t remember her ever show-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing delight in anything I did. So much
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>had to do with just sitting there, just
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>serving time.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Our first “lesson” was to sit down and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>be quiet. Our second lesson was to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>memorize the pledge of allegiance to the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>flag. We did not understand what any of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the words meant. Being taught to per
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>form like trained dogs, we were given
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>stars and A’s when we were good; if we
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>could not perform, we were ridiculed
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and punished. When the teacher’s pun
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ishment did not work, our parents were
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>called in. We were learning to behave,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>not to question or to think.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Most of what I was taught in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>school seemed foreign to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>my life at home. Learning to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>read from the Dick-and-Jane readers I
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>thought, This must be how white children
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>play. These standard American public
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>school readers were published from 1935
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to 1965. They presented the American

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sage I got from my black teachers was
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that something was wrong with us if we
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>were too different: skin too dark, hair
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>too short or too kinky, dress too color
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ful, talk too loud.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Ilearned to be ashamed of who Iwas.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Slowly and laboriously we read each
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>word in Little Black Sambo, a book still
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>being published today. Even though we
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>were six and seven years old, we knew
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the story made fun of us in a cruel and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>demeaning way. Is this supposed to be
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>some kind of joke? I thought as I exam
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ined the teacher’s face to get a clue. I
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>could see she was seriously trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>teach us to read.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>In fourth, fifth, and sixth-grade history
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and geography classes, we learned about

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>about European imperialism, slavery, and

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>out. This was supposed to make us feel
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>proud, but we either fell asleep or tuned
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>out.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Elementary school had additional pit
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>falls. Fights often began on the play
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ground and on the way home from
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>school. I now see that those fights were
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>dramatizations of feelings of jealousy, in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>dignation, frustration, rage, and despair.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I was glad I was not the teacher’s pet,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>though none of us really escaped. As vic

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>safe” place we had; in the schoolyard,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>we practiced turning on ourselves and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>our schoolmates. The seeds of internal
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ized racism sprouted as we learned to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>hate, fear, and mistrust one another.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>When it was time to go to junior high
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>school, I rode on a school bus past neat
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and well-equipped white schools to a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>small, dilapidated black school. My
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>older brothers had been sent away to a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>better school. I felt my parents did not
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>care much about my education because
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I was a girl. I didn’t like going there at
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>all, and although we never spoke of it,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the other black kids didn’t like it either.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>The bus trips were often tense and un
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ruly. We knew ours was the worst school
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>in the county. During the ride, a handful
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of kids dominated the rest of us by
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>playing “the dozens”—talking about ev-

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of learning how to survive. If you could
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>not do it, you had to fight or silently with
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>stand humilation. You also learned to hide

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>going to make a difference in our lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>We had learned that our way of talking,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>which expressed our experiences, was
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>not a legitimate language, that our way

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in fields with worker shortages. It was a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>test of memory, of concentration, and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of willingness to study and repeat the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ideas from the textbooks and teachers
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>without debate or discussion. To them
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>it did not matter what we might want to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>do. We were told they knew what was
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>best for us.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>It wasn’t easy to decide to be a good

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>one more thing to isolate me further
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>from the other students. Being from a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>poor family, I could not afford the new
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>clothes, junk jewelry, and junk food

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>life after high school seemed hard for
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>black people, an end to the freedom we
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>enjoyed at the moment.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>At the same time, I learned from my
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>father that beinga black female was more
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>problematic than being a black male. I
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>longed to grow up and be on my own

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>but were turned away. Almost overnight,

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ed. A gymnasium, auditorium, cafete
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ria, and chemistry lab were added, and

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>black teachers brought in. Students who

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Every few months we were tested, and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>our test scores were published and dis

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of education said it showed we would
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>never survive in white schools and that
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>we were better off where we were. But
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>our parents knew our separate facilities

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>didn’t say anything to us or about us;
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it seemed nothing was good enough
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>for them. When we did something we
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>thought was better, they tried to act as
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>though it hadn’t happened. We quickly
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>arrived at an understanding of the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that there was no room for us inside
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>white schools. Our blackness—the thing
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that had always made us so visible—now
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>made us disappear.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>But our parents were determined that
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>we would stay. To them, abuse was just
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>taken for granted. They would tell us that
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>if we got the same training as white stu

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>However, our white classmates picked
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>up our white teachers’ cues. They tried
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>not to see what was going on. As our
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>isolation mounted, we could not name
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>what was happening to us, but we knew
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>how it felt. When we tried to speak of it,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>we were asked, “What are you talking
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>about?” and by our silence we hid our
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>anger at the distortion of our identity and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the exclusion of our reality. We didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>realize it at the time, but in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>cope, we searched for new ways of being

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>sources of strength. Those of us who

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>a number of times, but those who kept
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>trying became almost unstoppable.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>My first college was a black
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>school in southern Virginia.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I got a scholarship to major

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>culty appreciating the administration’s
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>efforts to “civilize” us. Gloves, dresses
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and hats were a Sunday requirement. We
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>even had lessons in how to behave at an
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>afternoon tea. We were required to at

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in from elsewhere. Only slowly did this
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>school become a little more relaxed.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Years later in art school I painted my
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>white models red, blue, or green. Usu
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ally my white instructors said nothing,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>but occasionally one would say, “That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>not the way you do it!&quot;—meaning that
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was not the way to make art. But for
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>me, art had to express how I saw, felt,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and thought.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>It was only much later that I began to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>understand what it meant to grow up in
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a culture where you leam to see your

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>an educated person did a lot of damage
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to the young black girl I was. When peo

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>causes tremendous conflict, not only
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>within other people’s expectations, but
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>within myself as well.

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Plan books and begins leafing through. The Kid is

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>“I don’t care what you read,” I say. “I care what

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>&quot;Alright,” he says. “Allllllllright!
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I realize that in the excitement I have forgotten to

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Bored is Toby. The Kid won’t tell us his first name.

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Corey and Chris, Lupe and a Farrah Fawcett look-
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>alike named Debby Yazzie. Steve and Rick and Jon

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>those present to leave early. The Kid hesitates at the
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>door, checks out the set of my shoulders, and leaves
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N026'/>Next class, the two no-shows show. Theyve even
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N027'/>done the assignment. One of the no-shows, a tiny

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N030'/>the entire class carefully ignoring him. He is busy
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N031'/>with his Life Plan and a calculator. I read them an
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N032'/>early story by Doris Lessing and when I call on him,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N033'/>he gives me a gorgeous warm smile and says he’s
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N034'/>sorry but he drifted off for a minute.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N035'/>The other no-show is dressed all in beige: cotton
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N036'/>shirt and sweater and pants and shoes that have an
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N037'/>unusual, in my view, number of flaps and snaps and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N038'/>loops. He himself is also in beige: hair, skin, eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N039'/>eyelashes, even the fine fuzz on his arms. The Kid
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N040'/>stares at him. Those orbs of his, they seem to eat up
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N041'/>everything—hungry, shining, long-lashed, gray-greer
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N042'/>holes in space. He’s got a funny almost-sweet smile,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N043'/> like he can’t quite believe what he seems to see
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N044'/>My Angela comes to mind. I remember shopping
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N045'/> with her in Tucson. We’d stuffed ourselves on tama

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>The room has gotten awfully quiet, so I run on for

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N019'/>how she does that and then do it. Next assignment, I

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N022'/>“Does it have to be real?” Rain asks.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N023'/>The Kid is studying me again. I start to move down
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N024'/>the aisle to pick up their work. Rain has woven some

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N026'/>as I approach her seat.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N027'/>“T’m sorry,” she says in her high little voice. “That

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N031'/>If you can make me want to be there, honey,”.

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N010'/>They are puzzled, surprised, disappointed.

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N013'/>more often than not open an envelope and let a re

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N015'/>now and then I sit with my sleeping potion and let it
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N016'/>rest on my tongue and, even sweeter, let the printed
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N017'/>page I hold in my hands rest in my mind. “June Jor

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N019'/>good sleep of the worker on those nights. So when
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N020'/>they glance at the last page of their papers and let
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N021'/>their eyes rest briefly on my face, with pleasure, with
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N022'/>petulance, I know how it is.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N023'/>Later they come to my office, that small room with

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_17' n='N026'/>Ilisten. Toby is charming. He mentions Paris Review
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_18' n='N027'/>and his hope of being a successful novella-ist. He
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_19' n='N028'/>waits for me to appreciate the joke. I smile. He talks
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_11_1_tl_20' n='N029'/>vaguely of Ralph Ellison and the tyranny of print. He

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>She gets confused. She’s not real sure what an ad

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>think of language in just that way, as a shelter, as a
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>structure, as a home. I imagine a new essay and for

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>bag and pulls out a bandanna. She wipes her eyes. I

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>“Tm bummed,” she says. “Tve got so much inside

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Oh, she says. “Tm sorry.” She starts to get up.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Wait,” I say. She hefts the bag to her shoulder and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>wobbles a little from the weight. Compost, I imagine.

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and begins rummaging in it. “Here,” she says, “this

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>I pick it up and hold it in the fluorescent light.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Sunlight, she says. “Natural light, that’s what

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>“Blessed be,” she says, blushes, and leaves. I rub
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the crystal along my temples. It’s not much more
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>than a small cool smoothness.

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>beautiful. He’s wearing sleek shades, the mirrored
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>kind. He’s got a long tweed coat on over beat-up
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Levis and a clean clean white, button-down shirt. I
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>have to look away. How he does what he does—put
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that surface together without a flaw—it scares me.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>He’s curled his hair and when he pulls off his shades,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I can see that he’s lined his eyes with indigo pencil.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>He’s got those rich-bitch fine-ass features that our

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rolling on toward the last few classes. The Kid is writ

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and the new people who began to move in and the

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>kid in class. Rain is dotting her i’s with dots. Toby
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>has ceased to remind me of an oil slick under a
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Jaguar-XKE. Every image I arrive at for him is a sleek
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cliché, and I give up, wondering if that failure isn’t

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>“Alright!” she says and pauses. She’s looking at me
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>like she’s measuring me for something.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>“Listen, she says. “Ifyou want to try some of our
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>food, there’s a restaurant up near that old grade

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>quickly. “A lot of the neighborhood people do

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>of her perfect belly visible, with the three woven Gua

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and hands it to me. We tie it around my wrist.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>“Till it falls off, right?” I ask.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>For friendship,” she says. “I may have to miss the

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>says. “Her head comes to my shoulder.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>&quot;My grandma’s too,” I say. I think of that small,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>proper, fierce woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Debby reaches out her hand. “I want you to know
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Ilearned a lot,” she says. We shake. Her grip is gentle
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>as a child’s.

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Is that fair, do you think?” she asks.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Yes,” I say.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Well, why?” she says.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Because I am Ms. Green and this is Creative Writ

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>“No,” she says. She is blushing behind her blusher
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I mean me.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Rain is nodding her dreads vigorously. The Kid
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>looks at me and shakes his head. “That’s cold, Ms
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Green,” he says.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>“True,” I say. “However, when one uses ’you’ for

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I hate myself for that “OK?” and the Kid knows it
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>He grins.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Jennifer,” I say. “Come and see me. I won’t change
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>my grading system, but l’Il tell you l’m sorry for what I

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>“OK,” she says and makes it almost a question.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>They leave the room with the assignment, which
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>is the standard one. I want them to write a short

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>That&apos;s all, except that I want it to be of content anc

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Jennifer never makes it to my office, but Rain does

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>for the sound to fade.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>“That carries our prayers,” she says firmly.

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>It’s Tibetan, she says. “We’re all métis,” she says

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the same.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>“What if I reject that?&quot;” I ask and wish I hadn’t. I

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>“No problem,” she says calmly. “It just is.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I am spared more because she folds her thin hands
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in front of her and says, “I have a problem and I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>wonder if maybe you could help me?” She smiles a

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>“Hopefully,” I say and, for the first time in the se

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>from her chest. The bells chime along. She takes a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>deep breath, closes her ginger eyes and gets serious.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>&quot;My old man left me, she says and suddenly be
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gins to sob. “Don’t worry,” she says, “it’s good to cry
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>like this, to let your feelings out. It clears the fourth

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I hand her a tissue. I wonder how they get out of

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>kids who live in this maze of teachings. I watch her
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>rub her eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>“Really,” she says, “It’s OK. Besides, I drew him in,

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I see that it isn’t even teaching, it’s a cheerful chaos
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of beginnings of teachings. And the others, the ones

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>in ten years, the ones with the Life Plans, the ones

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Your father left?” I ask, though I know better.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>No,” she whispers, “Miguel, my old man. He

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I don’t. I say, “I know how it is.

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N036'/>room. The Kid is wearing a silver dragon on a chain

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The first task was to collect material: lists of names and
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>addresses, articles, and literature on the artists and
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>slides of their work (which we intend to house in the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Mills slide library for future reference). Secondly, we
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>have begun to conduct interviews with certain artists.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>lo conduct a good interview requires thinking on sev
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>eral levels at once: Is the tape recorder still working?
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>What should l ask her next? What did she just say that

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>them to discuss their lives and their art freely. Thirdly,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>we hope to make a “sampler” videotape with some of
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>these artists, which would make them more readily ac
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cessible to curators, collectors, and critics.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Since no one seemed to have done much research
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>before on this subject, I didn’t know quite how to go

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>who was also collecting material on this subject. Margo

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Secondly, while l knew there would be diversity within
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the Asian-American experience, I wasn’t aware of the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>specific aspects that I needed to consider in my re
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>search, such as whether the artists were American
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>born or had immigrated as children or adults.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Thirdly, the term “Asian-American” is so broad. There
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>are significantly different groups of Asian-Americans:
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Japanese-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Vietnamese-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Americans, Korean-Americans, and so on. I had to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>focus on the context of each Asian-American artist: her
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>specific cultural heritage and her family’s circumstances
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>as well as her personal history. Essentially, the type of

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Fourthly, I had to reevaluate what I considered to be
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the boundaries with regard to medium. For example,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>in addition to the standard “high art&quot; forms, such as
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>painting and sculpture, I have come across several
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Japanese-American women artists working in textile
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and ceramics. Textile art, such as fiber and weaving,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and ceramics, which have deep historical roots in Jap
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>anese culture, have often been written off in the West
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>as merely “craft.” It is easier nowadays to argue for
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>these “crafts” as legitimate art forms because of the
			</p>
			<pb n='54'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>efforts made by American feminists in the 1970s on
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>behalf of this country’s quilts and folk arts.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Finally, I realize that research in this subject must be
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>continued. The primary goal of this project is that it
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>should act as a catalyst for further inquiry. This project
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>is not an end in itself but rather a beginning. It&apos;s excit
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ing right now, however, because l am connecting with

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>lists or want to suggest more names. It’s beginning to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>function as a much-needed network system, and l plan
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>soon to publish (in some modest form) an Asian
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>American women artists; newsletter. It would be inter
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>esting to see these artists create a support systen
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>among themselves and to see the results of such a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>support system.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>YJK: Could you talk specifically about the situation of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>contemporary Asian-American art?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>DA: There is a tendency for financial and critical sup
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>port to be given to traditional Asian arts over contem
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>porary Asian-American art. This tendency suggests a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>stereotype of a “pure” Asian form, that one is either
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Asian or American, two separate identities. This situa
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tion is reflective of a larger problem with stereotypes in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>this country. Financial and critical support needs
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to extend out to encompass contemporary Asian
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>American artists; this would then help validate the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>voices of Asians who are Americans. Asian-Americans
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>are not simply Asian nor are they apple-pie American,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>but to varying degrees they are a blend of both cultures;
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>they can never ignore one or the other. Then there is
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the problem of the stereotype of “the Asian-American.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>For example, in professional and educational spheres,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>there is the stereotype that Asian-Americans excel only
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in math and sciences. Well, what about those Asian
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Americans who are interested in the arts?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>YJK: What is the general current situation of support,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>financial and critical, for women artists of color?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>DA: Public money in support of the arts tends to go to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>those organizations that support predominantly white
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>male artists. When financial and critical support is given
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>to artists other than white male artists, it is usually giver
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to white women and/or male nonwhite artists. So here,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>with women artists of color, we have a situation of a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>double minority status; consequently they tend to be
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>overlooked a great deal. In general, the problem with
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>color or ethnic diversity in museums includes not only
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the color of the artists but also that of the administrative
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>staff. There are several reasons why more “minorities’
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>need to be on the walls and within the administration.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>First, for social and political reasons, the art should be
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>representative of the public. “Minorities” are an increas
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ingly significant part of the population of the United
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>States. In the case of the San Francisco area, whites
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>now make up less than 50 percent of the population
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>(Therefore, the term “minority” now seems inappropri
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ate.) Second, simply based on its quality, this art should
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>be shown.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>YJK: What are your personal reasons for doing the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>project?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>DA: Mostly it’s my own way of understanding myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>am Asian-American and a woman interested in the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>arts. I find it significant that lwas raised in Hawaii, be
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>cause Asians are far from being the minority there; we
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>are in fact the majority. Consequently I never consid
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ered myself as a minority. So when I came to the main
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>land for college, I was shocked by racial stereotypes.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>was fearful of believing in them and felt it necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to prove them wrong. My interest in art led me in search
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of Asian-American women artists, who became role
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>models for me and whose work provided me with many
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>insights into our particular cultural experience. Essen
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tially, however, I began thinking about all this in 1984,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>while still in Hawaii, when I wrote a senior paper, “As-
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>similation of the Asian-American Female,” based on
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Maxine Hong Kingston’s novel The Woman Warrior,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>which was my first introduction to an Asian-American
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>woman’s voice.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>In late 1987 I found this touching passage by Alice
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Walker, which tells of her search for the unmarked grave
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of Zora Neale Hurston. Hurston was a major black
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>woman writer who died unrecognized and whose beau

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>learn how to do it later on, and the symbols and images
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>they select remain conventional.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Several years ago Itaught a class in which students
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>were asked to choose a subject, study it for a semester,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>photograph it, and finally make an artwork reflectingtheir
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>understanding and attitudes. Initially the students were
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>frustrated because they did not have any idea how to do
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>library research, how to investigate a subject in depth.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>One student selected a fast food chain to study and
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>photograph. On her first day of photographingshe found
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>she was not allowed inside the fast food restaurant with
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>her camera. I told her to call the corporate office to see if
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>she could get permission to do her project. After calling
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>over twenty people, none ofwhom could identify the right
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>person to ask, she was told to call Chicago, which she
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>did, only to discover that they in turn told her to call Los
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Angeles. In the process she learned that no one knew
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>who was responsible for the rule against photographing.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>She then asked about the corporate structure and
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>again could get no clear response. She started talking
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>with workers at the individual facilities and discovered
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>that they did not know anything more than their own job.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>They had no idea where the cows were bred, grazed, or
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>slaughtered, where the buns came from, or anything
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>about the corporate structure. They certainly didn’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>that land in Central America is deforested so that cattle
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>can be grazed for fast food chains in Europe and the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>U.S. Nor did they think about the wage structure that
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>results in economic benefits for management and in
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>vestors only. She began to understand the extent of their
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>disenfranchisement through disinformation. When she
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>reexamined advertisements of the happy family ofwork
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ers and customers, she began to understand the gap
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>between the veneer of the public image and the impen
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>etrable monolith of the corporation itself. She had not
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>set out to find this. She had simply wanted to take pic
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tures at a restaurant.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In another instance l asked my students to make por

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>photographed was asked to write about her/his hopes,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>dreams, and greatest fears. We assembled the final text
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and images into a book, which was then xeroxed and
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>distributed to participants. This project gave students an
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>opportunity to interface with the various strata of per
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sons at the school and find out something more about
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>them. The students learned about working together on a
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>project and discovered that the finished book made visi

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>art education can be achieved. A love of form and of

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>are crucial to the full growth of the individual artist.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The relationship of the artist to the culture and to the

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>life. It is crucial that art education include a discussion
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of the integration of the two, which includes staying res

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_11_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>In this regard I find that books such as Cultures in

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of Margaret Lucas Cavendish hidden among the

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Printed (1668). The hand-cut parchment is yellow and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bound in worn leather. The portraits of Margaret have
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>been torn away from the front of each volume.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The prologues, epilogues, and dedications are
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>soaked with justifications and apologies. For

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N024'/>Again Hilary pauses. “What is language and learning
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N025'/>but natural?” she utters quietly to herself, then aloud,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N026'/>only to be hushed by those around her.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N027'/>Hilary reads some of Margaret’s plays—The Con

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N030'/>the others. She also reads the criticisms of them:
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N031'/>Her works frequently do not meet even the loosest standards of

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N037'/>says aloud and is again hushed by those around her.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N038'/>She reads on:
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N039'/>The Duchess was entirely devoid of any dramatic instinct. In al

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N041'/>life: her characters are mere abstractions, qualities, and humours,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N042'/>uttering the fantastic speeches and quaint conceits which she loved
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N043'/>to write Firth, p. xxvii.

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N047'/>stares at the enormous stone house
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N048'/>nearby. The curve of the balcony is
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N049'/>strong and perfect. She sees herself in

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N052'/>one of those balconies. She moves closer to the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N053'/>house. The dim light of a fire glows across the sill of

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a second-story window. Hilary thinks she can make

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>shoulders. But the heat of the fire wafts over the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>image and it is gone.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The sun will soon be fully risen. Hilary has walked
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>all night, journeying from the library where Marga

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>And now the fire from inside that second-story

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Encircling Hilary, the flames fuel themselves with
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>pages of Lady Cavendish that have yet to be written.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Hilary joins the flame in a consummation surpass

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>do not exist.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N018'/>Mister Critik is ten
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N019'/>feet tall, and his

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N021'/>High Tower. His eyes are

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N023'/>the Tower of its dust, or what they see to be dust,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N024'/>even when the dust is sparkled confetti. Mister
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N025'/>Critik likes neither sparkles nor confetti amid the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N026'/>grayness of his decor. One shade of color, whether it
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N027'/>be gray or black or burgundy. For him, a brightly lit
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N028'/>party subverts the true nature of life. “Reason!
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N029'/>Reason! Reason!” he shouts from his balcony. He
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N030'/>must watch the way he leans, for the railing is loose.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N031'/>“They have told me to lay out the table with prunes

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_19' n='N034'/>Only half-expecting the Lady Cavendish to make
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_20' n='N035'/>an appearance (for she is, by choice, a recluse), Mis
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_21' n='N036'/>ter Critik prepares a dose of prune tea, which he
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_22' n='N037'/>does not quite finish gulping down before the front

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_24' n='N039'/>hurriedly stows his prune tea in a cupboard, next to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_25' n='N040'/>and slightly behind a volume of criticism. Just as the

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_29' n='N044'/>turs. “My, she is beautiful,” Mister Critik thinks, not

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_31' n='N046'/>Bashfully, yet with a certain aura of confidence, the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_32' n='N047'/>Lady steps to the right, allowing someone, apparently
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_10_1_tl_33' n='N048'/>a companion, to pass. Mister Critik catches the prune

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ter Critik, who has been told that he is good at think-
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ing. “Surely the Lady Cavendish dreamt her up.”

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>“I retum the pleasure, Mister Critik, and would
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>like to introduce you to my new friend, Hilary. Hil
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ary is unfamiliar with this part of our world, and so,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>to educate her, I have invited her to join us. I trust
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that poses no problem.

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Lady Cavendish wears a gown
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of rose-colored taffetta
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>trimmed with black lace, low

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>flowing at the wrists. Her hair
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>is piled extraordinarily over her brow, tendrils
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>hanging along each temple in perfect curls. When
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>she tums to Mister Critik and hands him the latest
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>volume of her dramas and one of her poems, he
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>smiles, accepting them both with the utmost honor,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>or so it seems.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>Much later he says (aside), “Your fairy poems are
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>in the league of Herrick and Mennis, perhaps even
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>Shakespeare. But your dramatic verses are horren-

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>And one S-shaped verse, even if it exists, which I
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>highly doubt, would compose an entire scene.

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>and offers more tea. He himself goes without, await
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>ing the moment of the women’s departure when he
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>will have the opportunity to finish the prune tea

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>cupboard. For he knows that if he and Margaret were
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>alone on a desert island, and Margaret made coco

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>for a mouth, she would be living by her imagination,

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>But Mister Critik will not admit this, even to him
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>self. And so he smiles.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Dusk falls due to Mister Critik dulling the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>flame with his eyes, sweeping the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sparkles off Fame’s High Tower and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>absorbing them into the black hole of
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>his decor. Someday the vacuum might
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>spit them back out again, or perhaps somebody will
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>enter and find them. The latter seems more likely.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Hilary must retum to the library; she has work to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>do. Margaret must go to rest in her Tower. She will
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>find a place to hide amidst the pages. Margaret hands
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Hilary a volume of writing she dared not give to Mis
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ter Critik. The two embrace before they part.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mister Critik cannot sleep and gulps prune tea, in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ebriating himself. In this state he attempts to feed
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the liquid to the manuscript of plays given him by
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the Duchess. But the manuscript won’t drink and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>instead gets stained a bloody burgundy and drips
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>onto the gray carpet. Panicked, he thinks of a way to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>protect the carpet and sofa, for his things are expen
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sive. Like a suckling child, he brings the manuscript
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to his mouth, but more quickly than he is able to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>suck the red liquid, the flame leaps from the fire
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>place, drying everything. He continues sucking, in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>haling the dried flakes of prune tea, then the carpet,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the sofa, the manuscript, and eventually even the fire

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and stacks of books, dull brown

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>But I say that artists always borrow,

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Critics say my poems are not well crafted,

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to be artful or crafty,

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>One poet friend said to me:
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>This poem is too short
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to say all you want it to say.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>She was right, and I went on
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>to write a much better, longer poem.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>This was good advice: not telling me
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>what to write about or how to do it,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>or implying that l’d never get it right
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>because I lacked some inherent talent,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>or that really obe could say it
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>better than I ever could.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>At its best, though, criticism
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>is always a very sharp tool:
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>remember never to offer or grasp
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the blade instead of the handle.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>At its worst, criticism becomes
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>a self-serving authority figure,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>a nosy landlord living inside our heads,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>getting rich on our fear and self-doubt.

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>then he says we’re no good anyway

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a song, a howl, or a whisper.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The hardest thing about art

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>To be an artist means to dare
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to paint and write lots of bad stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that is only fit for the compost heap
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>(but nothing beats compost for starting seeds).

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>means only showing the people

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>exactly what they want to see.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>And how original is that?
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>It’s the oldest trick in the book,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>if not the oldest profession.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N018'/>So please don’t tell me to take art lessons
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N019'/>or creative writing courses.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N020'/>I don’t have the time or money,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N021'/>and I have no room to internalize
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N022'/>academic opinions: my head is too full
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N023'/>of my own ideas that demand to be seen and heard
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N024'/>like anybody else’s children.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N025'/>Anyway, I never learned art in school.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N026'/>I learned that only silence
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N027'/>will satisfy every critic.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N028'/>But I failed to find silence

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Several years ago I decided to go to New
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>York to study dance professionally. After
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>teaching at a university, I was looking for
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ward to being in an environment that
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>values learning with the body and study
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing in a field where women have been
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>visible and important, historically. At the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>same time, I was terrified. To my mind,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I did not fit the typical image of a dance
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>student, and at the age of thirty I had
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>never studied dance full time. After con
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sidering several studios, I finally chose
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the Nikolais/Louis Dance Lab because of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>their belief that given time, work, and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>guidance, anybody can lear to I
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>was also impressed by the continuity of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the school’s teaching staff, which spans
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>three generations of dancers, including
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Hanya Holm who is in her nineties and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>one of the pioneers of modern dance in
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>America. The following are journal ex

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women in dance.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N025'/>I had my first class with Hanya and was
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N026'/>totally taken by her. “Mostly fear and fa

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>learned enough. Now you must leam to
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>give up, to make room. It takes courage,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>but there is no other way.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>There is much to leam from the body,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and not just dance either. The physical
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ity of our selves is basic to everythin,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>we do, yet it is one of the most neglected
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>aspects of our upbringing and education,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>which often serve to trap the reflexes
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and cauterize the instincts. Bringing
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>those back to life is, as l’m finding out,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>an excruciating process, physically and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>psychically.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Briefly I felt my whole body thinking—a
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>moment of vibration or alertness, not

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the arms. A sense of radiating outward
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>from inner movement. A glimmer that
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>blood, muscle, and bone are knowledge
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>able and sentient: consciousness in the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>curves of muscles, the rushing of blood,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the exchange of fluids and air. Cellular

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N025'/>In some ways the approach to the body
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N026'/>is very male: analyze, analyze, analyze,

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and apply the laws. Pull in, push in, liff
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>up—the desired image is definitely
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>male, androgynous at best, but never fe
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>male with curves and roundness, which
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>are considered “appropriate only for the

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>er tells us. Such a contrast to the way Rina

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Dance. “We worked on two pieces

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with slight variations and recitation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>rhythmic patterns. In this way the piece
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and its timing became a part of our
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>body.” She then demonstrated one of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>her practice pieces; it could not have
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>been more than five minutes in all. How

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_10_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>This learning is difficult and painful,

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>dance form. Predictably, this form was
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>taken away from them by men, and they
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>were outlawed from their own creation.

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The shekere is a West African instrument that
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>comes from the Yoruba people of Nigeria. Used as a

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N008'/>for religious ceremonies and occasions. The instru

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N010'/>bash, which serves as a drum. Beads strung on a net
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N011'/>encircling the gourd add a rattle sound:

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_14_1_tl_39' n='N036'/>can and leave when they have to.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_14_1_tl_40' n='N037'/>The music consists of complementary rhythmic

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Billie asked.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>vividly recalled the Mexico City conference
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>in 1975 and my first realization that many
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>governments see the women’s movement
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>as a threat to nationalism. My companion

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>is to love each other with tenderness and

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>No. Not necessarily. Women who love

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>asked yet another man, determined that a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>woman must be reacting to something.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>&quot;In our country there is often disrespect
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>between men and women. Daughters often
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>learn to fear their fathers and then also find
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>they cannot depend on the respect of other
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>men. Men in our culture sometimes make
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>disgusting remarks to women in public
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>places. We have music and movies that
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>equate sex and violence, and there are men
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>who rape, brutalize, and sometimes kill
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>women. No woman in our culture is safe

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;In our culture some of these things are

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>understand from talking to women at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>this conference, I continued, that until re

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and that laws against wife-beating are not
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>always enforced, even now&quot;&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Agreement from my listeners. “It is the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>same in my country. We are a long way from
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>arriving at understanding between men and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women. We are looking for ways to stop the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>violence and create understanding. Perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>someday men will listen to women and try
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to understand what they think, how they
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>feel, and what they want.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;And then there will be no more lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>life-styles?” came the question.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>&quot;No, no. There will still be lesbian life
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>styles. When women are no longer territory
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>to be conquered or property to be owned,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>they will be free to love whomever they
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>please. Women will then be free to choose
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>love. When men respect women’s right to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>choose, they will no longer be offended by
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>this choice!
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>“What about religious and moral laws
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>which must be obeyed?” asked my first
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>questioner. I realized I was confronting a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>very polite wall.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Most religions teach the principles of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>love and respect, and yet many marriages
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>are based on contempt and abuse. Moral

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>behind me seemed to be moving closer.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>&quot;You would ignore the matter of sin?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>asked the second man, speaking some

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;I am saying that love between two
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>women cannot be a sin, that only violence
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>can be a sin,&quot; I concluded, aware of the 
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>pounding of my pulse and of my anger at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the indoctrination of these men who had

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>When I met Billie and Anna in the Peace

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Anna hoped that I hadn&apos;t gotten myself in

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>California state college system. It was the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>1965-66 term, and I was to graduate in
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>1966, after having completed my first two
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>years at a junior college. I had been a high
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>school dropout, had two children and a
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>husband, did all the housework, and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>had to commute thirty miles one way to

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>There were only three political science

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>aloof and rarely allowed me to speak, but
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>being older lhad the guts to speak up any
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>way. Word soon got to me from other stu
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dents that he couldn’t understand why a
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>married woman was going to college: What
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would she do when she got out?

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>In my last semester Iwas short of money
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>for books and fees and tried to borrow from
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the college emergency fund. As a married
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>woman, I was refused a loan. I cashed in

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>While attending university, I decided to

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>at another state school. I contacted my for
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>mer professor, who said I could make up
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the work by writing a paper. I did so, and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>he sent me a grade lower than I thought
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>deserved. When I called to complain, he
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>asked me to see him in his office, but after
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>arriving there he suggested we talk over cof

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>men before, including other professors, so
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>without thinking much about it, lagreed.

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>me, and kissed me—not passionately or
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>romantically, but hard. Iimmediately got the

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to get my grade changed upward.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Well, two can play the game. I let him

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>university and told her the story. She said
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>she knew a way to fix it. She called him on
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the phone, told him she was my adviser,

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and I had the great pleasure of saying
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>&quot;Sucker,&quot; and hanging up. In spite of her
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>having helped me in this situation, my “sav
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ior” apparently never did anything for any

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>become involved in the women’s movement
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>as far as know.

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>cancer, of which she will probably die. As l approached
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>her chest with my stethoscope, probably the fifteenth
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>person to do so in as many minutes, she raised up her
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>leg and fiercely kicked my hand away. I backed off.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>She’d made herself as clear as she could, I thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>without knowing how to talk. The next student, though,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was undaunted and placed his stethoscope on her
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>chest. The girl furiously kicked her arms and legs, and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>shook her head from side to side with a rageful expres
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sion on her face. An even clearer message, but this
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>time unheeded. Finishing his exam, the student dan
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>gled some trinkets above the girl’s face. “Look at the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pretty toys,” he said.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>What had the surgeons told her parents? How had
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>they persuaded them to allow their daughter to be trans
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>formed from a dead duck to a live guinea pig? Had they
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>told them she would have a longer life? Did they tell
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>her how new the procedure is and how risky the drugs?
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Did they discuss what kind of a life their child would
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>have? Did the surgeons ask the parents to consecrate
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>their daughter to the advancement of medical science?
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wonder if the parents are too numb by now to see their
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>own daughter’s rage.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Another patient, eight years old, had a very loud heart
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>murmur that we all went to hear. My friend asked him,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>“Have you ever listened to your heartbeat?” He said
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>no. She put her stethoscope in his ears, and he lis
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tened. He looked very interested. How many doctors
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>had seen him, in the half of his life that he&apos;s spent in
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the hospital, without thinking to offer him their
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>stethoscopes?
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>teach my patients what l’m doing whenever I can,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>whenever they show the slightest interest. Before Iwent
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>to medical school, I taught biology and basic science

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to working-class adults. While teachingl saw the most
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>poignant desire to learn, matched of course by the pau
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>city or resources society assigns to such low-priority
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>human beings: no labs or equipment, no libraries, and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>me as a teacher, self-taught in science with my art and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>humanities degrees. Yet l taught them better than

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>still nurture—a vision of a people’s reappropriation of
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>science. And I truly believe you can seduce anyone if
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you figure out how to tickle their curiosity. Play and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>intrigue can melt hard armor, and they are the way
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>back, I think, to connected creativity, to thinking for
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ourselves and together about how to live on this earth.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>1am daunted now, inside the belly of the monster, by
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the enormous effort and reevaluation this vision de
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>mands. Maybe I should stick with the play and com
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>passion, and forget the knowledge and skill. But it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>too late for that; curiosity has me hooked.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>One day, when the clinic was slow, an eight
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>year-old girl came in with her sick little
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>brother. While she bubbled over with ques
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tions about every little thing l did, she told me
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>how she could never go to college because it
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>would be too hard—she wanted to be a secretary like
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>her aunt. Having escaped from that dire fate myself,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>wanted to save her, too. I lavished praise on her
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>intelligence—to her mother (in Spanish), to the attend
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ing physicians, to anyone who could mirror it back to
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her. And I gave her my instruments, and let her exam
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ine me. She looked into my eyes with my ophthalmo-
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>scope and saw the delicate red blood vessels spidering
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>their way along the yellow retina toward the optic nerve
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>—and she even saw them pulsing with the heartbeat.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>She saw my eardrum, with the tiny sound-conducting
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>bones behind it, and the opalescent way it reflects the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>light. She looked inside my nose and peered up into
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the tall, dark, and narrow nasal cavern with its sheer,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>steep, curving pink walls. She listened to my heart and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>her mother’s and her brother’s and her own. I taught
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>her how to measure blood pressure. I told her that
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>there’s nothing worse than being deadly bored, and that
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>she shouldn’t let anyone stop her from dreaming big
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>dreams. “Go to college,” I said, “You’Il thrive on the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>challenge, and it will be fun.&quot; And I hope I gave her
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>something to remember. With the choices I saw her
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>facing, I didn’t stop to discuss what she might forget.
