				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Heresies is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly called art can have
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>a political impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our iden
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tities as women play a distinct role. We hope that Heresies will stimulate dialogue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the history
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to the broadening of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Heresies is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also social
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; our fields include painting, sculp
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>film-making. While the themes of the individual issues will be determined by the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of women who
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>want to work on that issues as well as members of the collective. Proposals for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>issues may be conceived and presented to the Heresies Collective by groups of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women not associated with the collective. Each issue will take a different visual
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>form, chosen by the group responsible. Heresies will try to be accountable to and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in touch with the international feminist community. An open evaluation meeting
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>will be held after the appearance of each issue. Topics for issues will be an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>nounced well in advance in order to collect material from many sources. It is pos
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sible that satellite pamphlets and broadsides will be produced continuing the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>discussion of each central theme. In addition, Heresies provides training for wom
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>en who work editorially, in design and in production, both on-the-job and through
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>workshops.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections are clarified
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audi
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ence, and to understand the relationship between art and politics, work and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>wórkers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard relation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ship of criticism to art within the present system, which has often become the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>relationship of advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set of genius
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>products just because they are made by women. We are not committed to any
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>particular style or aesthetic, nor to the competitive mentality that pervades the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the process of this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art.

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Some of us came to this editorial collective wanting
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to work with other Third World women to break the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>isolation of racial/sexual tokenism experienced in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>college, on the job, in the women’s movement and in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the “art world.” To exchange ideas. We realized our
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>invisibility in the women’s, feminist and art communi
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ties. Some of us had questions about accomplishing
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the work of putting out this magazine, given the myths
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>about us and our lack of experience in working to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gether. Others did not question the work itself, given
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the energies and skills that we have used to survive.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Some were leery and frightened of the interactions that
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>might occur during the process; others were intrigued
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>by these possibilities.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>To describe who we are is exciting. We are painters,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>poets, educators, multi-media artists, students, ship
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>builders, sculptors, playwrights, photographers, so
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cialists, craftswomen, wives, mothers and lesbians.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In the beginning we were Asian-American, Black,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Jamaican, Ecuadorian, Indian (from New Delhi) and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Chicana; foreign-born, first-generation, second-gen
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>gration and here forever. We are all of these and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>this is extremely hard to define. The phrase Third
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>World has its roots in the post-World War II economic
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>policies of the United Nations, but today it is a euphe
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mism. We use it knowing it implies people of color
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>non-white and, most of all, “other. Third World
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>women are other than the majority and the power
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>holding class, and we have concerns other than those
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of-white feminists, white artists and men.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Those of us on the collective spoke of being non
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>marketable artists. We talked about how our creativity
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>is drained off by menial labor in order to survive, and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>how, as Third World women artists, we are invisible in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the white feminist art culture that operates on a buddy
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>system like that of the white male culture at large.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>It was frightening when we spoke of not always
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>understanding each other, not trusting each other, and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>valuing different ideas and ways of being. With all the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sameness of our double racial/ sexual oppression, our
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>differences frequently did get in the way. We had a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to learn about each other, our varying class identifica
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tions, cultural history, symbols and tones of our life
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>styles, customs and prejudices. It was too much to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>learn even in almost two years of working together. We
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>still do not always understand each other in terms of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>who our cultures, lifestyles and oppressions have
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>made us be. But in working together we had to ac
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>knowledge the personal power inherent in who we are.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Our initial meetings were exploring, supportive, re
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>affirming—sometimes like group therapy. But this
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>changed as we got deeper into the work. We estab
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>lished various kinds of working relationships around
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the tasks to be done, based on skills, interests, work
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>schedules, proximity, etc. Sometimes becoming very
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>close and remaining that way; other times the close
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ness fading as soon as the shared task was done.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Certain questions arose and were only partially
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>answered. Is there a difference in the way feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>functions among Third World women and white wom
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>en? Can working relationships be established and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>maintained between lesbian and heterosexual Third
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>World women? Can Third World women afford to par
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ticipate in volunteerism, since we have little, if any,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>financial security as it is? Can we as Third World wom
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>en work collectively? Do we recognize that many of us
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>actually practice feminist modes of being while reject
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ing them in theory?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>There is one issue that was a surprise, but maybe we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>always knew about it. It is the intensity of our way of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>relating to each other. We trigger deep feelings and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>equally intense responses. We yell and shout and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>curse and laugh, get angry or protective or critical,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>caring or domineering, all on a grand scale. It can be
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>frightening, and it probably was for most of us. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>realized that it was all right, while others couldn’t take
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>it and left. There are probably very real and sound rea
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sons for this to be the way we relate to each other. In
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the future, when we understand it, we will probably be
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>able to change. But until then we should not let it stop
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>us from working together. Too often in the past it prob
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ably has. We can and will move beyond this.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Another issue that plagued us throughout the year
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and a half was our relationship with the Heresies col
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lective. It vacillated from our being vaguely aware of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>their presence while we were engrossed in our work, to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>reactions of anger and suspicion because of unclear
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>or double messages that we felt were racist and pater
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>nalistic. Interestingly enough, we all recognized these
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>incidents when they happened. Since there are no
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Third World women on the Heresies collective, our
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>editorial group did not have a liaison who was knowl-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>edgeable or sensitive to Third World women’s issues.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Communications were frequently awkward, confusing
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and presumptuous. Some writers, artists and activists
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>would not submit their work, viewing the Heresies
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>collective as racist and feeling the collective was using
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>us, making no real efforts to correct the ongoing situ
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ation. When decisions were being made about our
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>efforts and issues without any consultation with us, it
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>was enraging and exploitative. We found ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>without the resources, organizations, connections
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>or the finances to do anything about it. Too often we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>had to come to a reassessment of why we were here in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the first place.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>What did we envision the end product to be? A re
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>flection of all of us—those of us who stuck it out and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>those who couldn’t take it. Those women we under-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>stand in terms of their lives, their art and their politics,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and those women who live their lives very differently
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>from us, who express themselves differently through
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>their choice of subject matter, media and style. Of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>course, we realized it was impossible to actually rep
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>resent all the experiences and concerns of every Third
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>World woman, but omissions on our part in no way
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>deny the meaningfulness of their existence or art. We
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>tried to put their work and ideas out there for others to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>see, for that was our primary reason for coming to

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>between the artist and the critic: how does one

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>unfavorable to the artist? Does criticism exist
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>as a thing in itself, can it exist as such, or does

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>response was a feeling of negativity towards
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>criticism and the institution of art writing as it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>is manifested in art periodicals, mass-produced
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>art books, and newspapers. From my vantage
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>point as an artist, I find that critics usually
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>view an artist’s work while it is on exhibition in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a gallery and, occasionally, while it is on view
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>in a public institution. A number of critics do
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>not as a rule go to the studio independent of an
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>exhibition. More often than not the gallery
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>exhibition brings them forth, prodded by the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>dealer or the artist, or coaxed by financial
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>necessity...the need to earn money or “brown

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lished. The critic is therefore viewing work
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>which has been preselected by the dealer. A
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>gallery is a business. Making money is its
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>primary objective. The critic is used by the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dealer as a means of endorsing the “product
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>(work of art), ripening it for sale. (If a repro

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>article, it is often sold as a result of the en
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dorsement.) Criticism is contaminated by the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fact that it is used to market a “product.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>parallel in the non-art world can be seen in the

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>create a need for a particular product in order
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to increase profits. The critic is therefore used
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as a means of “hyping” an artist’s work.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>A number of unconscious factors determine
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>what is marketable and what is not, who is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>written about and who is not. These un
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>conscious factors include learned attitudes re

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>taboos of a culture. In this culture work by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>white males is more marketable than work by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>non-white males or females. (Occasionally
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>“honorary status” is given to a non-white if a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>market is temporarily created for the work.)
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The needs of the buyer are based on class,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>caste, fashion, and personal preference, guided
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>by unconscious factors. The buyer will tend to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>select that which appears to enhance self-image
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and improve status. The dealer is influenced by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the needs of the buyer. The critic is used to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>“blessing” this interchange and making it appear
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>on the surface to be something other than what

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>A simplistic allegory about the system could
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>be set forth: Some critics are gourmets (others,

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>this recognition the critic accepts the menu
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>(gallery staple) which lists the special of the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>day (current exhibition). The critic may praise
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>or damn the cooking but returns for more. The
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>critic rarely cooks at home (goes outside the

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>One could see the art world and the critic&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The art world is a neolithic, loose association of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>clans within a larger tribe. The clan chiefs are

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>are the shamans whose talents are sold through

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>designated for this purpose (private and public

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ism in “Te acuerdas mujer.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This assertion of intellectualism is indirect in

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The modern Chicana, in her literature, tries to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>synthesize the material and spiritual conflict of

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of Mexican culture and traditions, but her body
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>is trying to survive in a hostile capitalistic
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>environment, and she keenly feels the tech

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>shows the contradictions that exist between the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>two.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Sylvia Gonzales expresses this concern in the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>following: “There are many Mexican cultural

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>In ancient times, the world was populated by
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>small people or Táchul. Then there was a great
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>cataclysm in which the earth turned inside out
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and trapped the small people or Táchul. But life
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>began to be born again, and from a cave in the hill
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Ashpesh, in Santa Cruz, farther north than the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>valley of the paintings, in Pájil Káike, the people
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and animals of that time emerged.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The first to emerge from the cave was a wom
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>an. She emerged without coming from any par
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ents, by the work of Seecho, the Principle of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Good. She was endowed with supernatural
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>powers, and she was señora and dueña of the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>earth and of the animals and plants which lived
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>on the earth.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>This woman had a child whom she loved very
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tenderly.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>One day the fox frightened all of the other ani
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>mals, who ran helter-skelter into the fields. The
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>woman went out on foot after them, worried for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>fear of losing them. Her child, to join the flight of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the animals, converted himself into a beautiful
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>white pony and followed behind them at a gallop,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>vanishing across hills and into the pampas.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The woman also transformed herself into a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>white mare and ran, trying in vain to bring back
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>her scattered property.

			<pb n='14'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>So then it happened that the white pony, the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>beloved child, died by drowning in the lake of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Gootchel Aike, into which he had stepped to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>drink and frolic.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The woman returned to her human form to cry
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and lament this irreparable loss. But she said to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>herself, “What use is weeping? What use is la
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>menting? If it won’t bring back my child to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>And so she went, grieving as she walked day
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and night across the plains, eating nothing and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>drinking from the salt lakes to make death come
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>more quickly.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>“ want to die!” she said. But death did not
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>come.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>So behind a large thicket of calafate, which
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>protected her from the wind, she decided to make
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>use of her magic powers and transform herself
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>into a mass of iron. But before becoming miner
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>al, she sang in a heart-rending voice a Tehuel
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>che song which repeats: “Lamego Táan Poguen
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing Gue-ä” [“Heavy shackle of my race, of my

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Next to the calafate thicket remained a sacred
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>meteor. And on the bank of the lake of Gootchel
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Aike, where the white pony had drowned, rested
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>another meteor, of smaller size.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>From that time on, animals were distributed
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>all over the face of the earth, and they were free,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>with no master other than those who were able to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>hunt them.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The human beings who came after the first
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>woman also distributed themselves all over the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>huge Patagonian region, without forgetting the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>respect and love they owed to that first senora
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and dueña.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Both sacred places were visited by the Tehuel

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and festivals there. Behind the forest of calafate,

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>they concentrated in her remains all of their

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>José Chaiuy was the one who handed over the

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Listen, they say that once upon a time there was,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>no?, a man, now, a big man, and they say that he
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>lived with a woman, he wasn’t married, he just
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>had this woman, that’s all, and so, you know, as
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>this man was pretty old and he couldn’t please
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her anymore, so the woman got tired and left,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she went with another and then, see, a few
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>months later she came back, but she came back
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pregnant by the other man. The man took her in
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>because he needed her, that’s all, he took her in
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>pregnant and everything, and time passed and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she had the kid, but the man hated the brat,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>didn’t love him, see, but the man was a worker,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>well, that man, even though he was a heretic he
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was a worker, that man worked hard. But one
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>day, see, he woke up grouchy and the kid cried
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and cried, that annoyed him, so the man grabbed
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the kid and took him away and he killed the little
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>brat and he buried him, and he covered him up
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>with some stones, and he piled a mountain of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>stones on top, he covered up the brat and he
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>went back to the house. So the woman had left
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>him and the man had been living alone, see. But
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the man kept on working. Well, time passed and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the man was making himself rich, he&apos;d bought a
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>cow, he’d planted some sugarcane, he’d planted
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>some corn, he had sheep, he had everything,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that man. He got rich, he made himself a good
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>house out of wood, and he was the best, see,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that man. But always, you see, he’d remember
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the crying of the little brat. All night he’d hear
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that the brat was crying, he could hear the little
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>brat crying, and the brat kept crying, but the man
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>was strong, strong, he wasn’t afraid, he didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>move, “and you ain’t gonna get me, brat, he
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>said, “and you ain’t gonna get me... and he
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>didn’t get him. It looked as though the little soul
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>had gotten tired, and had left off crying and suf
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>fering. But, you see, time passed, and one night
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>he heard over the hill a sound like thunder, like
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>thunder, and it started raining, raining and then
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>he saw rushing toward him a mountain of mud
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and rocks and a flood and in front came the flood
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>like a snake, as fast as a light, see, it was coming
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>like a light, going like this and moving from one
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>side to the other side, this light, and those thun
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>der sounds were getting closer and closer to the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>house, and the man stayed calm because he said
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to himself, “it’s not dry, so the flood won’t come
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>up here because down there there’s like a gully
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and that’s where the current always goes, that&apos;s
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>where the flood always goes, it never rises up to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>my house” but, see, this time it came, it came
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and it came, the flood, and it came toward the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>house with the light in front and it was coming,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>just getting closer, and so now the man began to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>be scared, he shut the doors and started looking
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>through the crack in the door and so then, see,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>he saw that the flood, with the mud and the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rocks, was coming up toward the house, see, so
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the man barred all, all of the doors and the flood
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>just kept coming up the land where the man&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>house was and the stones started pounding on
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the door and he’d barred all the doors, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>man heard the flood coming and it hit the door
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and then it retreated and then from inside the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>man could see again through the crack in the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>door and then he saw that at the front of the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>flood was coming the skull of the dead kid, you
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>see, and the little skull hit against the door and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>kept on hitting it until he broke it down and by
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>then the man had gone running for the other
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>room, and he’d barred that door too but the skull
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>came in anyway, the little skull in front, the flood
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>behind just like a snake, they were following the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>man you see until, following the man, they’d
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>knocked down all the doors in the house. And the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>little skull was coming in front, moving, the little
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>brat’s skull you see, the skull of the dead one,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the little angel in front of it all. And he kept
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>chasing the man, and the man had to jump out
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the window, and the little skull jumped out the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>window too and followed him into the hills,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>climbing, they went climbing the highest hills,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and the flood, with the skull of the little angel in
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>front they just kept following and following the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>man, who, by now he was giving up, until he fell
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>end over end, see, and then all the clouds dis
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>solved and all the storm and thunder passed and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>everything was at peace. And the next day they
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>found the man, see, who’d been covered up by
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the flood, been covered with mud and rocks, and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the little skull on top. And this was the revenge
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>of the little angel, the vengeance of the little skull.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>He’d killed the man, and he’d covered up all his
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>property, the good house made of wood and all,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and that was the revenge of the skull.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>here was a man, no?, who lived with a woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>he wasn’t married, he just had the woman. Now,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>you see, the woman had a kid. So you see the kid
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>annoyed the man, one day he was enraged, he
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>took the kid and he killed him, and buried him
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>there under a churqui Ithorny bushl, there he put
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>him and he covered him up. Well, time passed
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and the little soul began to cry. Wouldn’t let the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>man sleep, man started to decay, and stayed up,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>poor man, because the kid just wouldn’t let him
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>sleep. And he cried all night, round and round
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>the brat cried, and it was that little brat who cried.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Well, until the man came to a seer, a fortune
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>teller. We’ll see what this fortune teller said to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>get rid of the crying brat. Here’s what the fortune
			</p>
			<pb n='17'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>teller said: “Look, what the little angel needs is
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>that you give him some things he likes. Give,
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>he’ll have to leave you in peace. Give him little
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>clothes, give him a little bottle of wine, give him
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>little shoes, all these things you’re going to give
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the little angel like this: put them right there
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>under the churqui and then you’ll see he’ll stop
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>plaguing you. So the man kept giving him
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>things. “But now, look, now give him big things
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>because now the little soul has grown, now the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>little soul is big. Now you’ll have to take a man’s
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>clothes to the little brat. And the man took him
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>some shirts and some rope-soled sandals, and
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>so he kept on taking him clothes. Well, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>little soul kept right on plaguing him, kept right
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>on crying. And the fortune teller said to him,
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Give him more, give him more. Until one night
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>during the carnival the man went to a dance, and
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>there he met that seer wearing a pair of creased
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>trousers that he’d given to the little soul. And
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>from then on, instead of being in debt to one
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dead person, he owed for two. TWO!

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>elating experience. They affirmed my belief that
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>fulfillment and personal power are manifested not
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>only in creation and accomplishment, but in the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>process of accomplishing as well.

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>First, tell me about the organization you work with,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Third World Newsreel.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Third World Newsreel actually started as Newsreel,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>which was formed in 1967. A group of people got
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>together because they felt there was no alternative
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>media exposing the reality of the Vietnam War.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>They felt an urgency to make films about what was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>really happening in Southeast Asia. They began to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>catch on nationally, you know, by plugging into the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>student movement, getting people involved. But it
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>was pretty much dominated by white middle-class
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>males, just as the established media scene was, in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>terms of technical skills, access to funds, all kinds of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>things. By 1970-71 the women’s movement began to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>grow, and women started taking more prominent
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>positions in Newsreel. I came in on it in 1971.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>From where?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was teaching, I was a student, I did all kinds of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>things. I came because l’d heard it was a place
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>where 1 could make social and politically relevant
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>films. But I was the only non-white woman in the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>entire organization. There was one Black male. So
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>walked into this film group—l was all dressed up—
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and I walked into this hippy crib—the whole place
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was a mess. I just went in and said, “l want to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>learn how to make films. They were a little
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hesitant.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>You had no training?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>had very little training. See, l’d always wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>be an actress. I loved the movies. But I was raised
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in Communist China, and Asian culture in general
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>considers actresses to be messed up, so it was de
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>cided that I should go into the sciences. I studied
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>physics. But when I was teaching in a little com
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>munity college in Jersey we rented a film from
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Newsreel, and when 1 saw it 1 said, “Hey, that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>pretty hip!” So 1 looked them up. At that time in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>New York the Young Lords and the Panthers were
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>hot, so when Newsreel saw that 1 was of the Third
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>World people they sort of welcomed me. After being
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with Newsreel for about eight months it began to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>bother me that all these films about Third World
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>people were being made by white people. Well,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sometimes there were a few tokens involved but
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>basically they were made by whites. Something was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>missing, some kind of gut feeling, something cul
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>tural, and I had problems dealing with that. So we
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>organized a Third World caucus within Newsreel.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>And this caucus worked after hours?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Yeah. We worked till 12 o’clock, 2 o’clock, 3 o’clock.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>But we were all real young. I was only 20 when 1
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>came in. So, after we organized the Third World
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>caucus, some other people came in, like Sue Robe
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>son, who is Paul Robeson’s granddaughter, and all
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>this created total chaos among the whites. There
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>was a lot of antagonism because we were very na
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>tionalistic. Finally the whites decided they should
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>disband, which was fine with us. They left us some
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>equipment, though we had to struggle to get it. We
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>argued that the equipment belonged to Newsreel,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and whoever was left to continue to run the organ
			</p>
			<pb n='27'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>jzation should get the equipment. But all the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>money, which was their personal money, went with
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>them. So we were stuck with no money and hardly
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>any skills. There were about twelve of us. And you
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>know the folks are jive too, 1 mean, some of them
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>didn’t want to work, didn’t want to learn, got into
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>their ego trips. Still, we started making a film on
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Attica—Teach Our Children.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Who worked on Teach Our Children?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Sue Robeson and myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Just you and Sue?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Right—two women making a film about Black and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Puerto Rican men in prison. Sounds funny. We were
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>so nationalistic that every time a white person hap
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>pened to show up in the film we’d purposely edit
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>him out. Now when 1 look at that film it’s a joke be-
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>cause it doesn’t have any continuity. But the gut
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>feeling was there... While doing that, we got evicted
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>from our building and had to find another space.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>But on the day we were supposed to move only
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>three people out of the twelve showed up. So the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>three of us moved and told the others bye-bye. We
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>began to do some fund-raising while maintaining
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the office by renting the films left by Newsreel. The
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>first time we applied for grants we were rejected,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>but the second time we received $6,000 for three
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>films. Soon after that there was only me and Sue
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>left. We decided to call ourselves Third World
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Newsreel. Our films would focus primarily on
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>minority peoples—Native Americans, Chicanos,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Asians, Blacks, Puerto Ricans. We’d also make
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>films focusing on women, who are even more op
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>pressed, and we’d distribute films from Africa,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Latin America, and Asia. That’s how we justified
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the term “Third World. Now 1 don’t even question
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the terminology because, domestically speaking,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Third World means minority people united against
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>their common oppression.

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>When were you able to stop doing other things to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>support yourself and devote all your time to film
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>making?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Never! I still can’t. I was on welfare for a long time.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>told them I wanted to make films, and that I was
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in a training program at Third World Newsreel and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>from that I was getting §25 a week. So 1 qualified,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>although they told me 1 was crazy. But basically it
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>comes down to this: if you want to do creative work
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you have to find support from somewhere or you
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>have to do something against your will. I wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>make films—that was it.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>You told me when we talked on the phone that
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>you’d entered the Attica film in a Black film
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>festival...
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Yes, International Black Film Festival, organized in
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Philadelphia. The film was really not that well done
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>technically, but it was one of the first films that had
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that feeling coming through it. People still use that
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>film...Anyway, we entered the film because we’d
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>rented it to UCLA and the brothers there were very
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>impressed with it, and also because Sue Robeson&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>name rang bells. Her name wasn’t on the film be
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cause at that time Third World Newsreel had a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>regulation that no one’s name would be used. But
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the festival people heard that she’d worked on it so
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they invited her. She told theml’d worked on it too
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>but they said that since l’m not Black I wasn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>eligible. There was a lot of arguing back and forth;
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>told them they were discriminating and that they
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>should be understanding of the fact that smaller
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>minority groups didn’t have their own festival. I also
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>felt that Blacks, who were most prominent in the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Civil Rights Movement, should try to educate and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>unite other minorities in documenting our histories
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and present conditions. I personally felt that l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>learned a lot by reading the histories of other
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>minority people. l’Il tell you a story. Back in 1965
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>when 1 came to this country 1 was “adopted” by a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>white American family in North Carolina. l’d never
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>met them, as I was in school, but they invited me
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>down for Christmas. He was the vice-president of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the First National Bank. Everything was cool until
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>got on the bus to go back to school and the driver
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>told me to go to the back of the bus. I could hardly
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>speak English but 1 managed to ask him why. He
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>said, “Go to the back. And 1 saw that all the Black
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>people were sitting in the back but it didn’t occur to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>me that they might not want to sit there. So, I said
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>to the driver, “No, 1 want to see the view, or
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>something like that, my English was so bad. But
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>getting back to the festival—finally we got in and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>we won. Later 1 began to realize that there were
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>other issues that 1 wanted to explore, issues that
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>didn’t focus on purely nationalistic lines.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>You’re billed as executive producer of Inside
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Women Inside, right?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Well, those are just titles. That film happened be
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>cause we’d gotten the $6,000 from the New York
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>State Council on the Arts to produce three films.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Now, on the average, it costs a network $40,000 to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>make a 30-minute film. But they gave us $2,000. So
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>submitted a proposal for a film on women in
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>prison because after Attica, we’d done one called In
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>the Event That Anyone Disappears which was made
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>in the Trenton-Rahway Prison, also male. My own

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>experience had been in the Women’s House of De
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tention when l’d had problems with immigration. So
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>subjectively I knew what it was like inside, the iso-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lation. We started the film in 1974. It took five years
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to make it. We’d put out a call to women who might
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>be interested in working with us and 50 women
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>showed up—all colors, all classes. By the end of the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>project we were down to five.

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>All but one, but she’d done time in Bedford Hills.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>In fact, she’s into her Muslim thing now...While
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>we were shooting, though, the survival thing got so

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and me were left. Then, after five years together,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Sue left, too.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Well, how was she living all this time? Was she
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>making it on 825 a week, too?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Maybe she got a little more, maybe 850. But we
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>were all living together in the same house, sharing
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>expenses, so it was pretty cheap. We’d lived on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the Lower East Side, Harlem, Upper West Side,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Chinatown—it was cheap. ..So, 1 was left alone with
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the project and I was very frustrated because I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>that if you start something you should finish it. If
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>you’re one of those artists who makes art for art’s
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sake, then you can take ten years to do it, but if you
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>want to do something that is socially relevant you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in debt to the people you interview.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>When 1 saw Inside Women Inside at the Whitney
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>overheard a young white woman, obviously feminist,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>say the film was “just a cheap shot” at the prison
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>system because it didn’t address itself to the rela
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tionships women form while incarcerated. She said
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>it was “just about prisoners, not women. What did
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>you feel you were making a film about?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Nothing complicated. I figured that there are a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>people in this society who never get a chance to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>even open their mouths, especially women in prison.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Sure, when you go in you’re gonna hear a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>complaints; they want to talk about their case. But
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>think it’s very important for these people to be able
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to express whatever they’re feeling. Obviously there
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>are some more able to tie in a little logic with the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>situation than others but you have to look at the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>conditions. These women are not able to think
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>larger than themselves because they have nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>for themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Ididn’t agree with this woman’s remark because for
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>me the film was about women—and these women
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>were prisoners. For me there was no separating
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>those facts, but maybe that was because most of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>those women were Black. See, it has something to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>do with my ambivalence toward the feminist move
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ment. As Third World people, whether we are sym
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>pathetic toward feminism or are in fact feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ourselves, there’s no denying that we have different
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>concerns.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Definitely. That’s why l’d gotten somewhat turned
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>off by the feminist movement, after being very ac
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>tive in the International Women’s Conference and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>all kinds of things. I found that those women who
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>had the privilege of traveling all over the world,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>making reputations for themselves, were white
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>middle-class women. In relationship to overall
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>society their oppression is very different. They don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>encounter racism, they don’t encounter the sexism
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that Third World men give Third World women—so
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>it’s a very different type of oppression. You can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>simply lump it all together. And that’s not only on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the women’s question, that’s ethnically too. You
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>know, most institutions, like HEW, operate on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Moynihan’s melting pot theory—let them all melt
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>together and everything will be groovy. But that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>incorrect because each ethnic group has its own
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>traditions, histories, problems and struggles. There
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>are a lot of similarities but you can’t disregard the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>differences. Women’s movement, same thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Physically, we are all the same, but emotionally, as
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>human beings, there is a big difference between a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>person living on welfare and one living in West
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>chester county. The women’s movement fails to deal
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>with that. Plus, Third World women should be con
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cerned with the liberation of all people, because
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>we’ll never be free if our people are not free.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>What about the other film, Spikes to Spindles? Is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that the newest one?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>No, we’re just late releasing it. Spikes to Spindles
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was made in conjunction with the Chinese commun
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ity. And again, more political people are talking
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>about “Why did you not talk about the wages of the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>garment workers? You sound like you’re pro-union a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>little bit. Well, the film was made for the Chinese
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>community so the politics of the film has to be
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>within their perspective.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Of course, since you were funded by mostly Chinese
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>organizations.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Yeah, and at the end, when there wasn’t enough
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>money to do the subtitles in Chinese, those people
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>raised $2,000 more to have them put on the film. So
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>I listened to the people, the garment workers, more
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>than to the radicals. The people wanted the film.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>It seemed to me that you could have made three
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>films out of this one. You dealt with the Peter Yew
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>[police brutality) case, the garment workers, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>history of the Chinese in New York. Was there
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>pressure from the community to include all of these
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>issues?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>l’d have to say no. It was my own lack of direction.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>There was so much material because there weren&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>any other films being made about the community.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>don’t consider this the film; people will make other
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>films, better films, but at least l’ve made an
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>opening with this one. It’s a good introductory film
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>for people who have no idea what the Chinese are
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>about.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Have you thought of doing a film independently,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>without Third World Newsreel?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>finished a film in December for ABC. It’s about
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Asian-Americans in the Delaware Valley, and it
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>includes Japanese, Filipinos, Vietnamese, Koreans
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and Chinese.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Are you and ABC pleased with it?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Yeah, they’re going to syndicate it. This film al
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>lowed me to go a little beyond what l’ve been deal
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>ing with. I got more into the problems of Asian
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>families. Being confronted with Christianity and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>WASP values creates a real conflict for some
			</p>
			<pb n='29'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Asians. So the film shows how this conflict affects
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>us as individuals. And I was more critical than
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>have been because Chinese don’t like Blacks, that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a fact. Chinese don’t like Puerto Ricans—they don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>like them even more than they don’t like Blacks be
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cause they live so close to the Puerto Ricans. They
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>don’t like whites either but they play with them
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>more. The film shows some of this, although some
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Chinese won’t want to hear about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Who was your crew for this film?
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>All Third World people, every one.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>You screened them and you hired them?
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Yeah, but they were mostly my co-workers at Third
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>World Newsreel—they were all out of work. We
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>were both women and men, and we did a very good
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>job. We had three months to do it and we got it out
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>on time! Shocked the shit out of them. ABC had
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>initially commissioned Chris Choy, period, not Third
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>World Newsreel, to do this film but we fought that
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and now the film is produced by Third World News
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>reel. And this was important because the people at
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Third World Newsreel gave me a lot of support;
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>they helped me keep my perspective. But 1 don’t

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>enough...The next thing l’m going to do is a film
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>on battered women. We got a small grant to do it.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>We’ll analyże how the middle-class woman, work-

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>don’t normally go. Whenever there’s been a war or
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a revolution it’s been a male’s task to cover it. A
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>man is always up front.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>And you’d like to be up front?
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>l’d like to. 1 do have deficiencies, though. The
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>camera weighs 40 pounds, 1 weigh 92 pounds.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>That’s the number one problem. But the American
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Cinematographers Union is 99% white males. So.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>naturally they’re not designing cameras for smaller
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>built people. That’s why l’d like to learn more about

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>time that summer and didn’t want to leave me
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>alone in that hot apartment. It was a girls

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>called Camp Good Hope. I had a friend named

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>adored him. I told someone that he was my big

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>meant. Karl and I were pretty much the same
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>color except that he had blue eyes. A few
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>years later my mom thought it was time
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>started going to and from school by myself in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stead of her taking me on the bus. The school
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>was far away because it was not a local public
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>school but rather an expensive progressive prep
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>school called New Lincoln where there were
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lots of rich mediocre white kids and a few
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>poor smart white kids and even fewer, poorer,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>even smarter black kids. But all 1 knew then
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was that there sure was a difference between
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>where most of them lived (Fifth Avenue) and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>where 1 lived (Harlem). Anyway I started go-
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ing to school by myself and the neighborhood
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>kids would waylay me as 1 was walking the two
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>blocks from the bus stop to my house and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>would pull my braids and tease me and call me
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Paleface. By then 1 knew what they meant. No
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>one at school ever called me Paleface. Once
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>was visiting one of my white classmates at her
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>big fancy apartment house on Central Park
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>West where there were four doors into the

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>separate elevators with an elevator man for

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cook and a maid and a cleaning woman and a
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>governess (!!!). She said to her little brother
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>bet you can’t guess whether Adrian is white or
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>colored. He looked at me for a long time and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>very searchingly and said White. And she said
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>You lose, she’s colored, isn’t that a scream?
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>thought it was really a scream. I was afraid of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the black kids on my block because they bullied
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>me and I was afraid of the black kids at school
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>because they made cutting remarks about my
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>acting too white. But I wasn’t afraid of the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>white kids because they were so stupid. Later
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>when 1 was in fifth grade and getting sick a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and hating school 1 had a teacher named Nancy
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Modiano who really bullied me. Once we all
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>went on a hike and I became very thirsty and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she wouldn’t let me stop at a water fountain for
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>some water. When my mom came to pick me
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>up I was almost fainting. In conference with my
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>parents she once asked them Does Adrian know
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>she’s colored? I guess she must have thought
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was too fresh and uppity for a little colored
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>girl. My folks were very upset and wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>transfer me into another class but it was too
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>near the end of the term. Nancy Modiano was
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>one of the few whites who overtly bullied me
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>because of my color. The only others were
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>white philosophy students later when 1 was in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>college who hated me and said You don’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to worry about graduate school; a black woman
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>can get in anywhere, even if she looks like you.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>But as I got older and prettier, white people
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>generally got nicer and nicer, especially lib
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>erals. I was very relieved when my folks moved
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>out of Harlem when I was fourteen, and into a
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mixed neighborhood on Riverside Drive be
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>cause there we weren’t so conspicuous, and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>besides the boys in my old neighborhood were
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>no longer pulling just my braids when 1 passed
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>them on the street. In my new neighborhood
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>hung out with a Puerto Rican gang that accept

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Spanish. 1 didn’t see New Lincoln people very
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>much because they were turning into boring
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and neurotic people and were really getting
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>into being rich. But I made other friends when
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>started going to the Art Students&apos; League and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Greenwich Village. I noticed that all my friends
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>were white and that 1 didn’t have much in
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>common with the children of my parents’ very

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>friends. They seemed to have a very deter

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>(they said Colored) that 1 didn’t share. They
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and many of my relatives thought it was a

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Norma Jean Serena is a Native American woman from western Penn
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sylvania who, in 1970, was sterilized against her will and without
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her knowledge. Why was she sterilized? Employees of the Armstrong
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>County Welfare Department decided that because she was poor, and a
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Native American who lived with a Black man, she was an &quot;unfit
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Together with medical personnel, the caseworkers author
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>mother.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>&quot;therapeutic&quot; sterilization, listing her &quot;socio-economic

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>as the medical reasons. The sterilization was in no way
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>necessary for Ms. Serena&apos;s health.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Not only was there a conspiracy to sterilize her, but her three
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>children were taken away from her as well. She was told that her
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>children were seriously ill, which they weren&apos;t, and that they
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Meanwhile, plans were

				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>homes and illegally kept from her for more than three years.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Norma Jean Serena brought suit against ten professionals (both
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>as individuals and in their official capacities) and a hospital,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>charging them with seven counts of conspiracy and violations of
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>her constitutional rights. The suit was in the courts for over
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>five years. The judge refused to waive court fees, unusual when
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the plaintiff is poor. In addition, Amicus participation for ACLU
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was denied by the court. The State of Pennsylvania, which is sub
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sidizing a large portion of the defense, did everything it could
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to keep the case from coming to court.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>In January, 1979, an all-white six-person jury of two women and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>four men awarded Norma Jean Serena $17,000 damages for the theft
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>of her children, but nothing for damages for the forced steriliza
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tion. She is appealing that verdict.
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>This terrible outcome, along with equally racist verdicts in
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the case of the ten Chicano women in California (see CARASA News,
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Volume II, No. 7, August 1978), shows clearly that abused women
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>cannot expect anything in the courts except more insensitivity and
				<lb facs='#facs_41_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>brutality. The only effective short-term solutions must be pre

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ultimately what it’s all about—people experiencing
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>themselves as complete, as whole, wholesome hu

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>us to grow, to blossom, to expand. That’s what we
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>have at NBT (National Black Theater). The play re
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>flects that.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>You know, it’s not just a play...
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>l’m not one who is in love with the traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>European play form, as everybody knows. l’ve never
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>done straight plays with plots and romance and all
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that. But for ten years l’ve innovated new forms,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>we’ve developed them, and we’ve always had prob
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>lems marketing our product because there are very
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>few people who want to participate in life and share
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>themselves with other people. Zuri McKie, who did
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the lead in the show, has been with me for ten
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>years. She used to be an opera singer and she
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>wanted to study acting so she asked if I would
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>teach her. I had already started the mechanisms for
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>creating a national Black theater as a workshop
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>situation, so we all moved uptown and ten years
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>later this is what it is. But Zuri wanted to sing again
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and I supported her. What I had to do was write a
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>piece that would present her in a fashion that she’c
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>be comfortable with. So, that’s how this piece came
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>about. I wrote it for her out of my love for her
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>which is really a high compliment for an artist to
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>pay to another artist. No one ever wrote anything
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>for me like that.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Of course, you’re familiar with the kind of work that
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>a lot of Black theaters do, which is mostly
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>“domestic drama.” But even though the characters
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in those plays are Black, those plays are still
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>European in form.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Right, but there’s no other model so it’s alright,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>really. I used to resent it because that form sup
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>presses or compresses the energy. You’re not free
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to be spontaneous and to let go because the form is
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>more important than the feeling. So what I wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to do is to transcend the form and channel the feel
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ing into the experience of who we are. It’s difficult
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to come from your experience and not from your
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feelings, which are illusionary anyway—they go up,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>they go down—so the technique I developed, pyra
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>mid process of performing, trains people to be fear
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>less on stage and to enjoy themselves being spon
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>taneous and natural. Okay, what the other Black
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>theaters are doing is fine, within that form, but
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wanted to add to the form, transform the form,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>actually, open it up so that we could really express
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>our magnitude, our omnipotence, our fire. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>what makes the musical so powerful. The whole
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Black theater movement on Broadway is coming
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>from that, only it’s through the form of the Euro
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>pean tradition. I don’t knock it. They’re doing what
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they know how to do. But we’ve always had
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>innovators, pioneers, somebody who has a vision
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that’s bigger than the one that exists, and l’m one
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of those with that vision.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>When did you discover your own personal power?
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>don’t know. l’ve been like this all my life. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>just my karma.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>What 1 found interesting in Softly Comes a Whirl
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>wind was the overall tone of woman supporting wo
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>man, which is an attitude 1 haven’t found in much
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of Black theater. Is this something that has come to
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>you with the times?
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>No, l’ve always been this way. It just so happens
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that the theme of woman is popular now, but I sup-
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>port the men in the same way. I don&apos;t view it in
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>terms of gender, like female power vs. male power.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>We are who we are and we both have different ex
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>periences and different ways of expressing our
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>powers, but basically we’re all just energy systems.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Why did you start NBT?

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>having someone telling me to do something that
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>didn’t make sense to me. So 1 left. There was no
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>place for me to go but to the Black community.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>was brought up in East St. Louis, in the Black com
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>munity, and l’m very comfortable living with Black
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>people. This is where 1 thrive. So 1 came uptown.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>NBT started from my experiments with what
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Robert Hooks and 1 called The Group Theater
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Workshop, which was basically working with teen
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>agers. We wanted to present works in a way that
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>was beautiful and contained the essence of Black
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ness. The first vehicle 1 created to present them in
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was poetry by Gwendolyn Brooks which developed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>into a piece called We Real Cool. This was basically
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>using the same form that was used for Colored
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Girls. 1 mean, I was doing that form 10, 12 years
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ago. Anyway, for two years I experimented with a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>group of Black actors and actresses behind closed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>doors, not presenting anything, just creating new
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>forms. We created a standard of performance for
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Black people by recreating the oldest standard,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>which is the ritual form. Later we traveled to Haiti,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Africa, West Indies, Trinidad, Guyana—all over the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Black world. We built a base in Nigeria after testing
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the form and finding that it worked for Black
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>people, African people. When we came back to this
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>country we decided to merge the African traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>form with the Western form. We wanted to create a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>theatrical form that was inspiring, motivating, that
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>would make people leave the theater feeling up
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>lifted, like they could do whatever they wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>do, they could have, they could be whatever they
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>wanted to be. Now, Softly Comes a Whirlwind is
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>more traditional because there is a story line flowing
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>through it, but we’re going to revive one of our
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>classics, The Ritual. Zuri is going to direct it and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>l’m going to re-write it.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Tell me about the form used for The Ritual.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The Ritual is designed to get people involved, to
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>participate—spontaneously. People get up on stage,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>they share, it’s just one big celebration of life. I call
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Softly a “musical ritual” because it’s my form with
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>a story line added to it.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>You were trained to act in the traditional European
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>form. How did you begin to distinguish betweer
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>acting and experiencing?
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Well, when it didn’t feel good anymore. Clearly that
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>linear form didn’t nurture me, and l’m an excellent
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>actress. I mean, in “slice of life” drama what you
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>see is mostly negative; they usually talk about the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>villains and the bitches and the prostitutes, and you
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>get to use a lot of emotional energy, and then you
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>chew the scenery down and talk badly about each
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>other when it’s over. The audience isn’t transformed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>and neither is the performer. I felt that I, my in
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>strument, was bigger than that. So the process
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>was...
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Dissatisfaction, and then working through that...
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Right. Discovery, looking for another way.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>You’re writing your own music now, too, aren&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>you?
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Yes, out of necessity. I can’t find the right music for
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>us so I have to write my own. Just like the plays—
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>can’t find anybody who can write them so l do it all:
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_45_l' n='N001'/>create them, I develc direct them, and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>train the performers. And I train my people to do it
				<lb facs='#facs_45_l_2099' n='N003'/>all.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Do you do writing workshops?
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>We used to but it’s difficult because writers are into
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>solo, isolation. They don’t write from the experience
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and the NOW because that value system gets in
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>their way. They want to get the credit. When you
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>work with us you have to be willing to work
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>effectively.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>l’ve checked out some of the writing workshops
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>around the city, l’ve heard the kind of plays they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>developing and l’ve felt like an outsider at those
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>places. My plays are rather ritualistic, but in a more
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>psychological rather than spiritual way. l’ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>told that l’m not writing “Black drama. How do
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>you define “Black drama”
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>don’t define it. 1 don’t know what “Black drama&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>is. 1 just know that l’m a certain way, and that way
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>nurtures me, and that’s all 1 know to write about.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>And 1 happen to be Black so 1 write from there. See,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>don’t separate dance from singing from writing
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>from directing. There’s really only the experience,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and you can put it in writing, in music, in move
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ment, in preacher rhythms—you can put it any way
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>you want to. If you studied with us you would have
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to take all the classes everybody else takes. You&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>first take Master Liberation, then Pyramid Process
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and II; then you’d do a presentation, and from that
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>experience you would then write.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>t’s a seven-hour workshop that allows you to un

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>what Black women had accomplished under the

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and Black women in the world. A source of grow

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>numerical imbalance between men and women.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Ten to one, say some reports; five to one, say

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>men does not approach ten to one. In 1975, there
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>were 9.3 million Black women over 14, and 7.8
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>million Black men. The ratio, then, is six to five,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and even though this means there are an excess
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>million and a half Black women, it does not

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>are about 200,000 Black women over 14, and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>173,000 Black men. This is actually slightly bet

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>— and the reader can pick her own or read them

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Pryor on May 29 she asked him if he saw every
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>thing in terms of race, and he responded in the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>affirmative. As a Black woman I see everything in
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>terms of race and sex, and I find this vision
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>necessary. The view is sometimes clouded,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sometimes discouraging, but the alternative
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>views seem myopic, flawed, so 1 relish my

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Blackness, then there would be no such thing as
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>racism. What would that be like, Black woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to go 48 hours without being reminded of race or

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>My mother left with me. We moved to the back of a long, narrow, floor
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>through apartment on West Fourteenth Street. The two long, narrow windows
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>opened on to a narrow courtyard facing a high brick wall which blocked air
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and light from reaching our room. I had tormenting daydreams of being
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>trapped in that dead-end labyrinth, of running into that impenetrable brown
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>brick wall.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>remember standing in my crib nights watching my mother in a corner, on
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the other side of the long dim room, sitting hunched over a table under one
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>small light. She seemed to be motionless but she was painting roses. Roses,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>roses, roses, an endless stream of painted roses. In order to support the two
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of us she had to work day and night. In the days she worked in a factory
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>painting roses on heart-shaped porcelain boxes and at night, paid by the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>piece, she painted roses on as many lids as she could carry home.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>And so l started school. At eight in the mornings my mother would drop me
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>off at Church of AIl Nations nursery school, and at six in the evenings pick me
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>up as she returned home from the factory. I was two.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Ivaguely remember feeling abandoned, being frightened of the children.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>clearly remember them sitting me on a chair in front of the class and shooting
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>me with rifles while laughing hilariously; 1 remember them chasing me down
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>long, dark, mysterious, winding corridors, and down steep, cavernous stair
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>wells. The recurrent nightmare was as real to me as the long days at school.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Once 1 ran away from school and I remember my mother’s frantic worry turn

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tom of a telephone booth where 1 had hidden for hours. I don’t remember it
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>but I am told that I refused to talk at school—they thought 1 couldn’t. They

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The slave experience limited the musical ac
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tivities of many Black women. Although many

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>musical experiences as slave women, they were
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>able to stretch beyond these bounds. In 1854
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Alice Hawthorn wrote songs in which she used
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the guitar for accompaniment.19 Young Black
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women were expected to exhibit skills in piano
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>playing and singing and often participated as
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>soloists in the evening cultural activities held in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the Black community. Most of these Blacks
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>were middle-class and imitated the müsic that

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>they were discriminated against. Obviously, it
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>was not their talent and ability but the color of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>their skin that determined whether they were

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>liberating Black people. The stage for these

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>helped fugitive slaves escape, was an important
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>aspect of the abolitionist movement and songs
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were an integral part of its program. Many

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in the area. Harriet Tubman, contributor to the

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The jobs which opened up at the Navy Yard
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were for the men of the area. Various indus
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tries opened factories and shipyards on the old
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>docks; these “wild” Blacks could be hired
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cheap, and a lot of money could be made keep

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>by poor people; women were relegated to the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>factories and other minimum-pay jobs.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>At first, there were training programs to

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ing and pipefitting. Unskilled Black men,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>doomed to living on the margins of society.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>men who lived off hustling or women on wel
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fare, had a chance to work at a skill for which
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>they could get legally paid. The men who
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>worked there in the early days, in fact, used to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>wear their hard hats home daily, a symbol in
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>their communities of the status derived from a
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>skilled and well-paying job. This pride became
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>a part of our feelings about our jobs also; wher

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>we at first wore our hard hats home proudly.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Contrary to the hopes of the management,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>however, the novelty of the job was not enough
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to keep the men happy. People began to realize
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that they were expected to do dangerous work
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>with no safety precautions, were expected to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>work out of the trades, and had to wait for
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>years for upgradings within their crafts. Angry
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>workers began to organize job actions. The re

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the head of the family.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The older women who worked at Seatrain
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>were in some cases following family tradition:
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>one woman had worked as a welder in World
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>War II and had a sister who was a crane

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>others there at the time worked in the shops,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>which were considered the least hazardous
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>areas. They usually did less dangerous work,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and were accepted as “oddities” in an acces

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Meanwhile, changes in the outside world
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>continued to affect the trades. More women

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and all that shit. We heard that Seatrain and
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the other shipyards were being pressured by
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>federal stipulations to employ a quota of
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>women. The gates opened slightly, and a whole
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>bunch of us pushed our way in.

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>guilty. We were interviewed by a man who was
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>a friend of a friend; we women have our own
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>grapevine. We had our qualifications checked,

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>wanted to warn us about what we were getting

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>And somewhere on our journey, we two were

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>fitters. This we found out was a part of a plan
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to divide the women among various trades, to
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>keep us separate from each other. We were
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>actually part of an experiment in women as
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>shipyard workers that was set up with the hy

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>hoped that the men would be their accomplices
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in this plan. They were wrong, for a few of the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>men were actually helpful, and most just got
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>used to us.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>We did have many problems adjusting, for
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>most men initially rejected the women, in
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>particular the shipfitters. Shipfitters must work
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>in gangs, and directly with partners. A new
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>shipfitter must be assigned to a more experi

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the time that we were employed, there were
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>three women shipfitters and one woman burner
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>(me) assigned to work outside of the shops in
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the dock area. The supervisor admitted that we
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>had been put outside in the coldest month of
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the year in order to discourage us. Most of the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>men refused to work with the women, knowing
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that it would mean being closely watched by
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the management. Most felt that they would end

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>equipment with female partners. After all,
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>everyone knows that a woman brings trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>into a man&apos;s world, right?
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Fortunately for the women shipfitters, how
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ever, one man was willing to take them all on
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>as his partners, teaching them the basics of the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>trade. This group became the focus of a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>attention, with frequent complaints from upper
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>management people that one woman was al

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>own weight, and eventually the gossip and re

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>about women, politics, or sex. (Men are usually

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We women got together at lunchtime and

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>job. We became involved in the union and were
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>known for struggling against the union bureau
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>cracy, against sell-out contracts, and in favor of
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>more job security for women.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>In our day-to-day relationships with each
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>other, however, we still had many problems.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We were guilty of looking at ourselves with the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>eyes of society at large. In this society, and
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>more grossly on that kind of job, women were
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>divided into categories. They were the cheap
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>whores, available to anybody, the get overs,
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the opportunists who were out to get what they
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>could from men (on that job, this meant playing
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>up to supervisors in order to avoid working),
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the good girls (who wouldn’t work there any-
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>way), and the butches. This last category in
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cluded all those who could not be fitted into the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>other categories and wanted to hold a “man&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>job” anyway. These ideas affected us so much
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that we often played this game ourselves. In
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>discussions in our locker room in the early days
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>on the job, a great deal of time was spent
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>criticizing some women for being whores or
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>supervisors’ pets; and there was much specula
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tion among the more conservative about who
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>was a lesbian and who was whose lover.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>But we changed, and grew. Our constant
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>discussions, our support of each other, our
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>relying on each other for advice, comfort, as
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>well as criticism and discipline, formed a bond
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>between us that grew as time passed. We
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>shared lunches, equipment, views. Our experi
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ences affected the way we looked at ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>as workers, women, fighters. And how we
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>changed! Women with stereotyped views of the

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of what they saw. One woman, who was white
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and rather intellectual, was able to overcome
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her feelings of being an outcast, and to stop
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>intellectualizing everything. We Black women,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>in turn, had to deal with feelings of hostility
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>toward white women. There developed, in this
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>situation, a core of people who really cared
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>about each other.

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ever, the job did not. The tide has turned and
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>further crises in the capitalist system have
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>resulted in massive unemployment; reactionary
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cutbacks have affected the forward push of
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>women workers in trades and industry. Layoffs
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>started at Seatrain in March 1978, when the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>burning department was drastically cut back,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>leaving all three women burners out of work.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>After searching for jobs in our trades, we were
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>forced to look for other means of support. One
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>woman ended up working in a bar, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>other two in low-paying jobs in the garment in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dustry, where women workers, in factories and
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>offices, are given the most demeaning work
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and treated disrespectfully. The other women
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>were laid off almost a year later, and the last
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>hired suffered their usual fate: once more at

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>was able to get a job in an office since!
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>had some background in “paperwork. I ended
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>up in a clerical job that pays about two-thirds
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of my former salary. My new job took me into
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the “World of Fashion” with a famous brand
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>name company that sells high-priced jeans and
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sportsclothes. I was employed as a file girl, ex
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>pected to file, and to be a girl.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>One of the first things that struck me, in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>fact, when I began working in this men’s busi
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ness of dressing women, was the fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>women were all addressed as girls and expect
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ed to like it. It was a strange contrast—leaving
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the world of industry, of workers who struggled
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>for their rights, to work in an industry that
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>based itself on the myth of woman, the doll to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>be adorned. People spent most of their time
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>discussing ways to persuade women to be silly,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to starve themselves thin to look like some
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>man’s sadistic dream, to buy expensive clothes
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>that had to be replaced constantly. Important
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>matters are discussed among the owners and
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>upper-management personnel, who are all men.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>The few women with any authority are all white
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>and look like models themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>It was very difficult to make contact with any
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>of the women there. Most discussion centered
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>around clothes, hair and Studio 54. Class was a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>very important issue here. On this job, there
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>was a definite hierarchy in the office. The
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>lower-echelon office workers were not expected
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to fraternize with the upper echelon. Most of
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>fice workers were extremely concerned about
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>upward mobility. This is a direct result of edu
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>cation and cultural values in our society. Office
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>workers are generally “better educated” than
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>people in trades or factories. This means that
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>they are actually more indoctrinated into the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>system, and view themselves individualistically,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>at the expense of the group. This is the

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>around common interests.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The women in my office fall into sexist roles.

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ployed here, the company has expanded great
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ly, causing an increase in office staff at the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>lowest levels. This has meant an increase in the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>number of women hired to do the office
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>drudgery. With the expansion of the company
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>salaries for us women at this level have gone
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>down. This has had one good benefit, as there
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>is now a small group of women who rely on
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>each other for support and agree on small defi

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>very slow. Women office workers are subjected
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to subtle racism and sexism that is a part of
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>everyday office life and harder to deal with

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>confident in their womanhood than the women
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in trades because they are looked down on by

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>bands. Office workers are not put in situations
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>where they can challenge themselves the way
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>we were forced to in the trades.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>It remains for women to force themselves to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>be heard, not to settle for invisibility. It is im
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>portant for women to continue in the trades and

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>working class. Women working in offices are

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>speak english. it made life easier. this way they

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was named estela chavira rodriguez, of good

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to know what a mother was. her father was too
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>weak to raise the child alone. he became the

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>camp—food, beds, everything. Last summer it was
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>held at Manhattan College, and the kids lived there.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We organize it in a way that avoids cliques—we pair

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>volunteer work once a week. Last time we took them
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to the Bronx—you know that part of the Bronx that
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>looks like a bombarded area? Our kids worked in a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>program where they helped fix ceilings, clear lots,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>paint walls, all kinds of things.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Where do you get these kids from? How are they

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>select the new kids.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Are these usually problem kids?
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Oh, we have all kinds. They usually choose kids who
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>have leadership potential. Now, leadership potential
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>can be positive or negative. When there’s trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>people look to these particular kids, and sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>they’re the center of trouble. Wise guys, some

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and then with others...In working with the En
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>campment I feel 1 can use all the things l’ve learned
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>throughout my life because the job is not divorced
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>from what l’m really about. The only inconsistency
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>is that I realize that you cannot integrate people.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The word “integration” is a forcible term. In a way
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>we are integrated because we are all kinds of people
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>living in the world, although with a tremendous
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>conflict of interests. It&apos;s very difficult. I never

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>make integration a more organic thing. l’ve always
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>been against the melting pot concept. You see
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>where the contradiction comes in?—we’re all living
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>together whether we like it or not, oppressed more
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and more by economic problems, in a very com
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>petitive society which will become even more com
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>petitive as things get tougher economically. So l feel
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>good in working toward helping these young people
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to live together and understand tne problems they
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>face. They have to do that or they’Il end up knifing
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>each other to death.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>How did you come to head the program? What were

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Just by chance. l’d gone to an agency and told them
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>my background and about a month later they called
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>me and asked if l’d be interested in doing this. l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>worked with kids for a long time; 1 have a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>teaching experience. l’d developed programs for
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>high schools and elementary schools in California.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>l’d created social studies programs that would
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>convey the cultures of various countries through
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>songs, because music is my thing. My programs
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>were very successful because I was doing this when
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the Brown Berets were active in Los Angeles, the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>whole society was in turmoil. And 1 arrived on that
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>scene by chance, too. l’d come because I wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sing and I had a huge repertoire, and it sounded
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>nice to sing to kids, so I said okay, lots of fun anc
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>make some bucks. But it seemed that these kids
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>were waiting for me, like dry earth waiting for the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>rain to fall. The Indian kids would come to me with
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>things they&apos;d made and they&apos;d say, “1 like very
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>much that song about Indians and I want to give
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>this to you because my father&apos;s a Cherokee.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>They’d show me things of their background that
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>made me realize that 1 was getting into territory
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>that wasn’t all fun; it was a very serious thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>That’s what happens when you have a conscience,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>which is a very annoying bug. So 1 said to myself,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>wait a minute, 1 have to know more about these
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Chicanos, 1 don’t know anything about these Black
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>kids in the schools, 1 really didn’t know. 1 was just a

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>foreigner newly arrived in the country. I spoke very
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>bad English, also, so, first things first, I studied
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>English. Then Mexican culture and anthropology.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Then Black history, from the beginning. I attended

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>all the berets in town. I felt so ignorant and

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>teaching in college. Working with high school kids
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>is a different reality. And this city, New York, is

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tunities. The programs had ended in California so
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>decided to try my luck here. But as soon as l arrived
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>here I realized I was in another country. The con
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>tradictions within society here are so sharp, to such
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>an enormous degree.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>And especially here. Your office is located in a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>neighborhood where all the differences are very ap
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>parent. I know someone who lives here on Central
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Park West but I never come around here because
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>get very angry. I start choking on my own racism.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>That’s not a comfortable feeling.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>The contradictions are ferocious. You can’t escape
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>them. We’re right here in the bellybutton of it all.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>So after you arrived here how did you get involved?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>continued studying. I enjoy studying and it also
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>keeps me in contact with young people whose ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>are continuously changing, and changing me. I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the volts all around me. At first I didn’t work too
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>much but 1 volunteered myself to different
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>organizations. I sang in Central Park and after that
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>things started rolling again. People started calling
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>me, this time the Puerto Rican groups. So, I had to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>study again—l didn’t know anything about the his-
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tory of Puerto Ricans. To tell you the truth I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>even know where Puerto Rico was located. That’s a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>problem with lots of Latin Americans like me; we
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>become very localistic and have no feeling for what
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>is going on in other Latin American countries. But
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>went to the major organization, called at that time
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the Movimiento Independentista Puertorriqueno, but
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>later called Partido Socialista Puertorriqueno, and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>became less ignorant through my association with
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>them. I invented a course that would teach the his
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>tory and culture of Puerto Rico and a few other
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Latin American countries through song. While
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>teaching at Livingston College I got my master&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>degree and after that I came to the Encampment.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Who contacted you to perform at the abortion rights
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>rally at Judson Memorial Church last January?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>The women who organized it had seen me perform
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>at several women’s festivals. Also, they’d heard
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>about my recording, “Between Sisters.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>When was this album recorded?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>did it sometime last year. l’d designed a course on
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the Latin American woman, mostly through a desire
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to learn more about myself. I read a lot of socio
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>logical studies, mostly by Latin Americans but some
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>by North Americans too, on Latin American women.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>As a result I became aware of the effect upon me of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the way I was brought up, the environment, the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>values, and where all these things came from. I be
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>gan to understand where a lot of the conflicts l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>had in my life came from. A veil was lifted and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>began seeing things, like the impact of education
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and Catholicism, because, as you know, Argentina
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>is a very Catholic country. It’s like you’re always
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>carrying these heavy weights with you that you
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>have to drop eventually. I began writing songs
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>about that, about the search for who 1 am. You
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>know, l’d always wanted a career but in Argentina
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>it wasn’t proper for a girl to enter the University.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>What kind of career did you want?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>wanted to study psychology. But that was out of
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the question. I was told that 1 couldn’t enter the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>University because there were bad elements there
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and 1 couldn’t mix with bad elements. I was forced
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to study things that for me had nothing to do with
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the real world, with the people, so after a while
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>just dropped out and learned how to type. I was ex
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pected to get married and have children, not a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>career.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Your album about the struggles of the Chicanos was
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>publicized much more than “Between Sisters.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>think it’s because people consider problems of wo
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>men a secondary issue. And I understand that our
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>problems as a people, Latin Americans at home and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in New York, are so tremendous that women can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>afford to lock themselves up in our own particular
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>problems. But while we are considering the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>situation as a whole we are entitled to study our
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>selves, where our heads are at, and where this all
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>comes from. And I think from that revision of our
			</p>
			<pb n='84'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>values and a better understanding of ourselves will
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>come a much better understanding of men, our chil
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dren, our families as well. If we want to change our
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>society we have to change ourselves in the process
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>For me everything comes together. I don’t separate
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the women from the rest of society, and I didn’t do
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>it in the album, either. The album deals with wo
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>men living their lives in different ways, but 1 don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>think that’s accepted. When they talk to me about
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>my work they always say, “Oh, the children&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>album is wonderful” and they don’t talk about the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>women’s album. I find that kind of strange.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>When we were soliciting manuscripts for this issue
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>we sent notices to lots of Hispanic organizations
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>here in New York. But we’ve gotten very little
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>response from Puerto Rican women; in fact, there
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>were no Puerto Rican women working on this issue
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>with us. Yet, we’ve gotten some things from Chi
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>canas all the way from New Mexico and California.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Chicanas are very active. They’ve gone through a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>process of awareness and action that is absolutely
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>astonishing. You know, once I performed at La
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Pena, which is a very famous place in Berkeley, and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a group of Chicanas came from another town in a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>truck to hear me. One of them told me that she was
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>studying to be a psychiatrist, and that her father
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was a psychiatrist in Mexico. He used my women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>album in his therapy sessions because the women
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>identified with the songs. The songs were helping
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>them to deal with a lot of their personal problems
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that they&apos;d been unable to face. So, this young
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>psychiatry student requested that I write some
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>songs for older women because there are no songs
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>for them. This particular group had formed their
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>own women’s center and were using some of the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>therapeutic techniques that the father had imple
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>mented in Mexico, again using my songs. This blew
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>my mind because I never imagined that my songs
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>could have such an impact.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Were your songs non-political before you left
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Argentina?
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>They were decidedly non-political but they were al
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ways about people, their lives, and their struggles—
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the life of the miner, the life of the peasant, the life
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of the gaucho. Much of our folklore is rooted in the

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>But l’ve always been intrigued by people, so even
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>then my songs were devoted to them.

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>been increasing rapidly. From 1960-73, the

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>serious crimes increased 337.2%. 2 This means

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and that they have on the average two depen
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>dent children. Thus there are about 21,000

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women in prison understand that they have
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>some power over their own lives and that
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>people on the outside will support them, they
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>are often willing to become involved in difficult
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and lengthy court battles.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Upon release, women may attempt to regain
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>custody. Many states require that they prove

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>be returned. If they are on parole and have an
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>unsympathetic parole officer, it may be difficult
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to show that they are now capable of caring for
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>their children. Judges, too, may use the fact of
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>their prior imprisonment to prevent them from
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>regaining custody. Children then become the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>indirect victims of their mother’s imprisonment.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Ideally, prisons should be used as a last re

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>The fact that a woman is in prison does not
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>necessarily mean that she should forfeit control
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>over her life or that of her children. That is the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>way America has chosen to treat imprisoned
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>women. There are other alternatives.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Instead of being virtually abandoned and left
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to fend for herself, an inmate mother can be
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>supported and helped in a variety of ways. In

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>counseling and family law classes could be of
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>fered so that women could learn their rights
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and responsibilities. If mothers must temporar
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ily place their children in foster care, the foster
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>parents should live within easy commuting dis

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>receive support services so that they can make

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Rather, women who are too self-reliant and

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Prisons could serve an incredible function of
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>teaching women how to help themselves. In

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>times to come. Monday morning, going to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>school, a silence seemed to have crept over the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>grey cold skies of the city. As we walked along
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the streets, meeting other Nisei, there seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to be a burden on our minds. It was a quiet
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>walk to school that morning.

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Soon the evacuation orders were posted on
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>poles near our homes. When I went to notify

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>costly than prisons would have been. Campbell
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>told the President that “we can write a new

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>This exhibition was unique only in its open expression of racism. Racial discrimination pervades the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of the art world, including publicly funded “alternative” spaces. Even those spaces created especially for
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>minority artists are discriminated against by being drastically underfunded. The exhibition “The Nigger
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Drawings” points up this discrimination: while this artist gets support for his show the art world fails to pro
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>vide minority artists the opportunity to express and define themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>It should not be surprising that a prestigious art institution sponsors an overt racist gesture at this time. The

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>grams for better education, housing, health services and job training—are now judged inessential. When the

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>accompanied by a resurgence of both covert and explicit racism. “The Nigger Drawings” introduces to the
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>art world a new form of racism: brutality chic.
				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>In brutality chic, social pathologies masquerade as new-found virtues. Racism, sexism, poverty, social vio

				<lb facs='#facs_110_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>“The Nigger Drawings” not only reflects that backlash but also strengthens it.

				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>don’t know. I think it came about through a series
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of events. I think some of it came when 1 was in
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Benares, India. I could see the steps where they
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>burn bodies; everything seemed so honest, so
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>direct. We were in a boat on the Ganges and as a
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>body floated by the boatmen said, “Quick, quick,
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>take a picture, as if that&apos;s what we, being

				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>took some photographs. But 1 didn’t realize at the

				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>my uncle in the coffin because my family had come
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>from a tradition of photographing the dead. So we
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sat up there in the church with the preacher and
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>this old contralto singin’ these songs that probably
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>made my uncle turn over in the coffin, and the

				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sweater, standing there wanting people to scream
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and break up. I thought, compared to India, how
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>absurd this was, how ridiculous, especially the ex
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>pense. But I did take a picture of the coffin at the
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>graveyard and later I did a series of sculptures

				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>used anymore...l got the stuff, and twelve people
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>who wanted to have their pictures taken, and he
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>took the pictures. He was a real professional. But
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>anyway, that’s how 1 established a relationship with
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>him. We got a little money from the New York State
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Council to save the things he had in storage, which
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>were piles and piles of photographs. While sorting
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>them out and putting them in archival bags I came
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>across these funeral pictures. I told a friend about
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>them and he said, “Why don&apos;t you get Owen
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>(Dodson) to write some poems to them?” 1 thought
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>it was a terrific idea so 1 asked Owen if he could do
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>something like that. Owen said, “Oh yes, child,
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>know all about death.” Then 1 asked Mr. Van Der
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Zee and he said he thought it would be quite
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>unique. So that’s how we started. Now you have to
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>understand that when 1 first started with them I was
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>going into an area I had no experience in. I am a
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>visual artist. So I was a little overwhelmed working
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with Owen and Mr. Van Der Zee, who is a cult
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>figure. I didn’t have a name. But 1 had the idea. So
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>initially I was only going to act as an agent. But a
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>little later a friend of mine found an agent for me.
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>So you took your idea to the agent?
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Yeah, because 1 didn’t know how to do it. But that
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>agent didn’t work out so 1 had Owen and Mr. Van
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Der Zee sign an agreement saying that 1 would be
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the agent for a year and if nothing came of it every
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>thing would revert back to them. Then as the
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>project progressed and 1 realized all the work I was
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>doing I said, no, no, no. 1 am the author. So we re
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>wrote our agreement. I think if l’d known what
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>know now I would be the sole author and 1 would do
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>it with Van Der Zee and Owen Dodson. But
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>couldn’t do that then. I was so overwhelmed by
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>their reputations that 1 felt like they were these two
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>big artists letting me play with them.
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Well, that was your feeling, right? They weren&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>making you feel that way.
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>No. 1 laid that on myself, every bit of it. 1 chose the
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>subject, 1 put it together, and 1 did all the runnin
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>around for the book. But we did it according to age
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>with Mr. Van Der Zee’s name first. Anyway, we got
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the photographs copied and I started making a
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>dummy, juxtaposing the poems with the photo
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>graphs. I put these little doilies around the pictures
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>—they looked like funereal greeting cards. Through
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Owen’s suggestion, 1 took the dummy to Toni Mor
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>rison at Random House. She was really terrific. She
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>told me that what it needed was some comments by
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Mr. Van Der Zee on each photo.
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>You hadn’t done the interview that appears in the
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>book?
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>No. So 1 went back to Mr. Van Der Zee and got him
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to talk about each photograph. His commentary on
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the photographs was very interesting; it began to
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>compete with Owen’s poems.
				<lb facs='#facs_117_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>You know, if you hadn’t done the interview it would
			</p>
			<pb n='118'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>have been James Van Der Zee and Owen Dodson,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with Camille Billops—who did the work.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Right, and that’s the traditional role, isn’t it?..
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Toni thought the revision was better although she
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>had problems with one or two of the poems.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Did you like the poems?
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Yes, 1 liked them but it was a little shaky for a while
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>because if you have a potential publisher who has
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>problems with certain elements of your book, then
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you’re ready to say, “Oh yes, l’II get on my knees-
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>left knee or right knee?” But Toni said finally that
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Random House was interested in Mr. Van Der Zee.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>but not in the subject matter. So 1 said no, 1 didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>want to do a book about him; Iwanted to do this
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>book about these photographs. I didn’t see Toni
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>again for six months. But I did do this long inter
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>view with Mr. Van Der Zee.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>How many hours is that interview?
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>About two tapes—three hours. There’s a lot of it,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and it rambles. Because he rambles.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>love the interview. I think he’s very funny.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Oh, because that&apos;s coherent. Had you read the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>original transcript you&apos;d see that l’d ask him a
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>question and he’d answer the question three pages
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>later. But you go through this. It’s as if he has a
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tape of the past unreeling in his head. You see, all
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of his peers are dead. Anyway, I got back to Toni
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and she told me that they really weren’t interested.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Then another friend suggested that I take Mr. Van
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Der Zee’s captions away from the pictures because
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>they conflicted with the poems. I did that, which
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>made Owen absolutely ecstatic. So we put the cap-
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tions in the back of the book with the contact sheet,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>which really worked. Now we had the interview in-
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>troducing each section. Finally, 1 told Mr. Van Der
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Zee, “Well, l’m really staggering around town with
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>this thing,” and he told me to try his old publish
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ers, Morgan and Morgan. I dragged the book up to
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>them, they looked at it and said, “We want to sign
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>a contract. And there I was, so used to being re
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>fused; it’s so comforting being disappointed all the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>time because then you don’t have to do anything
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>else. So now, l’m gonna get all huffy, right?—1 said
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>it must be really good, man, 1 ain’t gonna give it to
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>them. I told them that 1 still had a few people to
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>see. I talked to my husband who told me to get the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>contract and everybody’d take a look at it. 1 talked
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>to a friend who’s published a lot of books and he
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>said, “Camille, it’s not the greatest contract in the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>world but it’s your first thing. You can hold out but
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>maybe you’ll get something and maybe you won’t.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>But I said well what is this myth about people get
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ting thousands and thousands of dollars for their
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>book. My friend said that money ultimately comes
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>out of your royalties, and he thought those days
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>were over anyway. Then 1 thought, well these pub-
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>lishers are familiar with Mr. Van Der Zee, they love
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>his work and would it not be better to go with pub
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>lishers who loved the work rather than speculate on
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>other people?
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>And also those thousands of dollars haven’t even
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>begun for Black women writers
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>You mean they’ve passed us by?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We’re still working on it.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Yeah, so we signed this contract. After all, it&apos;d been
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>two years. Owen and Mr. Van Der Zee agreed to let
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>me have first royalties, which would only be repay
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ment of all the money l’d put into the project.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The book itself is beautiful. Who designed it?
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The publishers. After l’d done my little doily stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>they wouldn’t let me do it. Mr. Van Der Zee just
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>loved those doilies but 1 had to tear all that stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>out.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>You thought of the title, The Harlem Book of the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Dead?
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Yes. Mr. Van Der Zee wanted to call it Crossing
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Over or The Other Side. But 1 insisted on using the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>present title...After all of this, 1 heard someone say
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>something about Mr. Van Der Zee’s latest book and
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>said wait a minute—l’m becoming invisible again.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>How did you deal with that?
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>thought, l’m not the hand servant. l&apos;m not
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>promoting a cult figure. We did this as equal art
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ists. I considered myself equal in another way, and
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>certainly, after having done the work, 1 was not the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>same person I started out being—you know, on my
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>knees. I was a full, mature artist and 1 had done a
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>book. It was another piece, like my sculpture, and
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>demanded to be recognized. When later a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>called from WBAI to ask me for an interview about
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the book, I said, yes, we can do an interview, but
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>not from the point of view of a cult figure. The book
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>is not about Mr. Van Der Zee—he was a vehicle. So
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>we did the interview as three equal artists, because
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>after all, Owen and Mr. Van Der Zee understood
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>that l’d done the work on this book.
			</p>
			<pb n='119'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Actually, it wasn’t Owen and Mr. Van Der Zee who
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>were negating you. It was the media.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Absolutely.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>So who’s handling the distribution, Morgan and
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Morgan?
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Yes. The books are in the stores and we’re trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>get reviews but it’s slow. l’ve sent copies all over.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The night of the book party 1 was able to raise
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>enough money to buy $200 worth of books for the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Hatch-Billops Collection and now we sell books
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>through mail order. In a red hot week 1 might send
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>out two books. It takes a lot of calling around and
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>pushing and it’s slow. l’d like to get some German
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and Japanese distribution. Germans and Japanese
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>are quite curious about Black people, provided we
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>don’t live next door to them. I think l’m finally
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>getting people to realize that I played a major role
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in the conception of this book and was not just some
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>woman...
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>You know, Camille, l’d proposed to the 8th issue
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>collective that we have a forum on the nature of
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ambition, and our personal ambitions, because it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>something we seldom talk about. We seldom
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>articulate what it is we really want, and why we
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>want it. I understand exactly how you felt about the

				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>your role in it was being diminished.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>couldn’t. 1 couldn’t take it. Because 1 wanted the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>same power. l’d gotten these well-known artists to
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>gether and 1 wanted the power from that.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>What power is that?
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The power from publication. It’s not a whole lot but
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>it certainly allows you to do other things. If 1 get in
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the New York Times 1 know what that means. l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>very tired of being an invisible person. I mean, l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>invisible among Black artists, too, you know this.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>l’ve documented a lot of Black artists for the Hatch
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Billops Collection, one, because 1 thought it was an
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>important thing to do, and, two, because it woulc
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>give me a field, which is good too. And because it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>not enough to sit in your studio. I can’t approach it
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Neither can 1. 1 ask myself, if l’m a playwright, and
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Ilove to write plays, how come 1 don’t just love to
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>write plays? l’m not fooling myself into thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>that l’m just writing them for my own enjoyment.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Oh, no. How can it go into fruition if you don’t see
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>it performed? No matter where it&apos;s performed.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>You’ve got to have a vehicle for your medium. l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>like to do another book, and l’ve got some ideas,
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>but l’m also working on my doctorate through an
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>independent study program at the Sorbonne in
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Paris. I want that doctorate because it will allow me
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>to do other things. I want everything I can have in
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the world. And 1 want it before l’m crippled and
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>blind. And I want power. A Black artist asked me
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>what 1 wanted and I said, “1 want what you’ve got.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>want to be in the newspapers, 1 want the grants
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>everything that you have, and maybe more. And
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>don’t necessarily feel romantic or sisterly towards
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>you, either.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>This is a Black man you were talking to?
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Yes. I dealt with that a long time ago. I was privi
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>leged to be on the tail end, and 1 was burdened with
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sisterhood and humanity, and all these things to
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>keep me on the tail end. But what did it for me was
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>teaching a Women in the Arts course. After going
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>through all the myths 1 tried to figure out where
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>these myths started. It started with, “After the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>waters parted”—who was there? Ah, that’s the key,
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>who was there.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Who was there?
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Well, as my father says, it wasn’t no split tails.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>That’s how he referred to baby girls—split tails.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>These concepts exist in the myths of Nigeria, Japan
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and many other cultures. We’re still playing out
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>these old Bible roles. “Whores” are still pretty
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>rampant, although it takes two to tango, and we stil
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>have “Jezebels” and all these kind of people, and
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>l’ve got to be burdened with sisterhood and brother
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>hood on top of this and everybody’s trying to pre
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tend that they’re not doing this to me? And they
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>are.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>And how do you propose a woman take power?
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>See, if you have some degree of power, they will
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>give you the rest of it. If you have power the media
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>will tell you that overnight. If we have no power
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>then no amount of making ourselves moral or kind
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>or trusting or constantly trying to justify that we’re
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>really not heathens will give it to us. White women
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>are beginning to have power. We as Black women
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>do not. We may enjoy some things because we are
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>women but we’re still going to catch that racism. If
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Black women would collectively withdraw from the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>churches we would have more of an equal say.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Why?
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Because people always go back to the Bible. Mr.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Van Der Zee even said it in the book: Man is the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>head of everything big on earth. When men get
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>their racism together women had better run for the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>hills.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>How are you, if you are at all, dealing with the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>blatant racism inherent to the feminist movement?
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The same way 1 deal with the racism of this entire
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>society. You have to find some area of expression
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>for yourself because if you’re going to admit to per
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>sonal powerlessness, then you might as well forget
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>it. You don’t have to want it all, but take what you
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>can get. Like those women you complain about in
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>that collective, the ones controlling this magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Why are they doing this collective? They’re doing it
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>as a vehicle to do other things, to get to some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>power. And 1 understand it. It has nothing to do
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>with sisterhood. Sisterhood is a vehicle that doesn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>include me except when it’s convenient. So if I get
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>up there and snatch a little something from that
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>table, l’Il take some of that, because that’s all l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>gonna get anyway. But in the meantime, l’Il go over
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>here and do this Hatch-Billops Collection. It gives
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>me another kind of power. And 1 like that.
