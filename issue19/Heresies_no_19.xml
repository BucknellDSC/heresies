			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Satire, like caricature, must above all be intelligent, insolent, precise, and funny. It must be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>merciless, unrepentant, probing, and distressing to its targets. It&apos;s not sledgehammer slapstick,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>it’s not sheer insult, and it’s not gags. Satire is eminently sociological; without a point of view or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>an analysis, one cannot produce it. Caricature takes aim at an individual, occasionally resulting
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>in lawsuits when the revelation of character is too accurate and too unmistakable, but satire
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>takes aim at a chunk of the social or cultural order, and at its most effective, it may even (in certain
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>times and places) be an aid to elimination, an enema in the polluted channels of the Establishment.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Satire, like feminism, envisions change. Always, however, there must be wit as well as incisive
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ness—a rare combiñation, and one we encountered infrequently during our work on this issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Brevity being considered the soul of one-half the aforementioned combination, we will
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>burden you neither with ponderous taxonomies of humor nor elaborate apologies for what is not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>present in our allotment of 32 pages and why. We wish you some good laughs over what is
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>present, and hope that next time some fool gives vent within earshot to the pronouncement that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feminists are all grim and humorless, you will have a suitable rejoinder ready to hurl.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>approved a proposed constitutional
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>amendment that would enable Con

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The vote today marked the first time
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that a full Congressional committee had

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Constitutional amendments must be

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>In fact, these Repositories would pro

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>c) Given that our overall population

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Sperm Bank Repositories is not to be

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Finally, under Section 2, we think it
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>essential that the female recipient of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the sperm have an element of choice

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We should also ensure that some of

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>will take over their duties. This rota-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tion of female personnel is more effi

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>who cannot themselves bear children

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Nurseries and child-care facilities are
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>necessary. The offspring of this breed

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>To this end, the breeding stock and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>their offspring must be protected at all

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>radiation exposure (Bertell et al., 1981).
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>We therefore anticipate that our select

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>As a little girl, Jane always worried that she would
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>furn into a pumpkin, rather than a princess.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>What color is a coconut, Jane asks her mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>All coconut is white, Jane’s mother replies. Oh,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>then all nonwhite things are noncoconuts, Jane
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>says. Yes, Dick adds. It a thing is a coconut or not
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a coconut, then it its a coconut, it&apos;s white. Like

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Before Dick and Jane enter the first grade, Mother
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and Father purchase coloring books to allow Dick
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and Jane to learn to color a thing with its appro

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Jane learn fo color only in the appropriate spaces,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that is, inside the lines.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Certain coloring books even have a color code
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>with numbers so Dick and Jane never have to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>think which color goes where. The kids understand
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the code:
