				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In the past decade, women have worked together, met

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>novel, emerging from and at the same time creating a new
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>attitude about group organization which proposes only egalitar

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>port/collaboration (such as consciousness raising) and the kind
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of group created have seemed unique. However, this attitude and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>these methods have been generally restricted to the small group,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>while the dominant form of mass organization among middle
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>class women has been conventionally reformist, aimed at chang
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing legislation, working for the ERA and so forth. This kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>political work relies on organizing methods historically unrelated
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to significant social change.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Many women who were in radical politics in the late 1960s
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>have fallen back on working methods that can have immediate,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tangible effect. This is a recurrent problem for the left: should it
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>work for immediate reforms, setting the stage for greater ones?
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Will reform (or opportunism, according to some) eventually
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>produce a consciousness sufficiently advanced to change the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>social structure? The women’s suffrage movements in England
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and America were also divided on this issue. Some saw the vote
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>as leading to further reforms for women, while others saw it as
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>leading to socialism. Today, reformist politics tactically in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>volved with a more or less accepted social structure are at odds
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>with attempts by radical feminists to rethink society and rela
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tionships within society. In the criticism of power, bureaucracy
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and institutional rigidity, in the emphasis on the personal, on the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>family (whatever its form), on education, child care and sex
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>—feminists have proved, consciously or not, to be anarchists.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The anarchist premise of radical feminism is that only
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>through collectivity and equality can individuality, autonomy
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and independence be achieved. Individuality, in this sense, means
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>something like &quot;personal and interpersonal realization.&quot; This is
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>’therapeutic&quot; only when the group helps women &quot;survive&quot; within
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the system, when the group becomes estheticized or escapist anc
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>class analysis doesn’t provide a basis for further organization.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Anarchist egalitarianism in women’s groups has been based not
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>only on political, but on ethical or moral grounds which presume
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that women should behave in a certain way—openly, honestly,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>with integrity. Women, by requiring this of each other, some
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>times create a feeling of moral superiority over men who, by
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>implication, and often in fact, are not honest among themselves,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>or &quot;in touch with their feelings.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Historically, ethical and egalitarian relationships among
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women did not result only from choice, as was the case with
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>anarchists, but from material conditions excluding women from
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>full participation in production and power—and thus from the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>hierarchies of production. Whenever women began to work

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>together, each contributing what she knew, there was relatively
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the same level of experience and skill—a necessary or “natural&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>equality, which often made democracy intrinsic to organization.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Because woman’s domain was traditionally more personal,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women’s political activities tended to center around personal
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>questions. (Sheila Rowbotham suggests that this focus is a
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>necessary precondition for the mobilization of women en
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>masse.*) But the moral imperative, when elicited as a response to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>oppression, often bogs down in the attempt to reconcile morality
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>with revolutionary strategy. The impetus behind a moral position
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>is more often rational than revolutionary; it is a call to reason, to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the recognition of how things should be and the decision to make
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>them that way. But the idea that change is effected only by reason
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and understanding can be utopian and/or reactionary, since
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>recognition of class and economic contradictions alone cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>affect the power relationships behind these conflicts. On the other
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>hand, the alliance of feminism with political ideologies that stress

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tive to the radical content of feminism. The real question is, then:
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>how can the content of change be maintained within a confusion
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about form? What organizational form will work without sacri

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>“The law of evolution is that the strongest survives!&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>&quot;Yes, and the strongest, in the existence of any social

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Thus, feminism’s major problem—how to concretize ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>about personal liberty within a form of organization that is not
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>hierarchical, that does not contradict individual freedom, and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that is not utopian—has been anarchism’s traditional dilemma as
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>well. Anarchist and often feminist arguments tend to be predi
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>cated on a moral-philosophical belief in a &quot;natural&quot; social state
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>without government or male-created institutions—a condition
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that would be “naturally” reinstated if government or male
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>institutions were abolished; that is, Nature herself, or women,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>would produce a better social organism.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Some of the most influential anarchists—Godwin, Prou

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>This meant reorganization through federalism, nations broken
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>down into small autonomous units. Psychological pressure
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>would replace force, for people would have to be honest and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>virtuous in face-to-face confrontations. Small discussion groups
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>would encourage the pursuit of knowledge, extending laterally to

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>were based not in practice but in reaction against the retardation
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of the French Revolution by governmental authority.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The major impetus of consciousness raising has been
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Godwinian, centering around discussion and inquiry with trust,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>loyalty and honesty as criteria for respect. According to the Red

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>While the call-to-arms was political, the methods were personal,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>based on the idea that the subjective experience of objective
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>conditions can lead to objective analysis. “We regard our per
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sonal experience, and our feelings about that experience, as the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>basis for an analysis of our common situation.... The notion
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>of equality, as conceived by feminists, has had a double mean
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ing: the struggle to be recognized as equal to men (the oppres
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sors) and the struggle to maintain equality among women (so as
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>not to oppress each other). “We are committed to achieving

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that every woman in our movement has an equal chance to

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>used to prevent dominance—and to recognize that personality is
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>an instrument of domination.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>However, when consciousness raising fails to distinguish
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>between sex and class consciousness and does not acknowledge
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>middle- and working-class contradictions, it falls into liberalism
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>—&quot;a moralistically humanitarian and egalitarian philosophy of

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>analysis if the critique of society rests upon change within the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>individual (or in self-help and education) rather than relations of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>production. While small-group interaction can extend laterally to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>become a mass movement, consciousness raising includes no
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>strategy for mass organization. Consequently, while personal

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>communes, it simply avoids the realities of production. A
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>commune is similar to a consciousness-raising group, it can
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>radically change the individuals within it but it is imperialized,

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>because poor wage-earners could not risk jail. For middle-class

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>upper-class women were given privileges, while bourgeois

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>industrialization, Kropotkin argued that the tendency of industry
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was toward decentralization. But small scale was also important

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the Bolsheviks limited the scope of popular power. Seeing that
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the Soviets threatened the supremacy of the state, Lenin put a

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>monopolize all social activities; the nature of Revolution is, on

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>counter-revolutionary, this last a criticism especially leveled
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>against outspoken women. All of history, she wrote, &quot;is continu

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>For Goldman, the primary ethical precept was the identity of

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>than morals. How, in practice, could the dictatorship of the

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and her advocation of the mass strike were replete with anarchist
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>assumptions. Though she was, in fact, strongly opposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>anarchism in any form, in relation to Lenin&apos;s authoritarian
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>political analysis, Luxemburg&apos;s refusal to support any rigid

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>complexities of struggle. While her goal was the same as Lenin’s
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the destruction of capitalism by the working class—she believed
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>in creative improvisation of leadership rather than in precisely
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>planned strategies. She did, of course, believe in leadership, but
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>considered good organization the product of action rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>its precedent and saw organization as growing out of struggle.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>While Luxemburg understood the necessity of centralism as a

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>German Social Democracy, she insisted, was not joined to the

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with the masses; it was to provide the &quot;spirit of movement&quot; to the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>masses. Luxemburg objected that the power of the Central
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Committee would be comprehensible only if it took the initiative
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of a &quot;vast revolutionary act,&quot; paralleling Goldman’s means-ends
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>argument.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Luxemburg saw the development of class consciousness as a
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>product of the frictions between the party and trade union
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>activity. Lenin, denying this dialectical function, saw trade union
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>activity as a mere reflection of bourgeois consciousness in the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>working class. Through her belief that continued agitation was
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the only way to prevent the retardation of the struggle, Luxem
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>burg supported the traditionally anarchist idea of the mass strike.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;Spontaneity, as she used the term, meant action as opposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>static or reformist attitudes; it was misinterpreted by the Bolshe
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>viks to mean confusion or to suggest that the party’s rational
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>policies should be determined by the &quot;spontaneous” desires of the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>masses. “But what has been the experience of the Russian socialist

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>changes have not been the inventions of several leaders and even

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>been the spontaneous product of the movement in ferment.&quot; The
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tactical policy of social democracy was not &quot;invented” but was
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the &quot;product of a series of great creative acts.&quot; Luxemburg argued
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that Lenin’s was not a “positive and creative spirit,” that he tried
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to &quot;narrow the movement rather than to develop it, to bind i
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>rather than to unify it....For us it is not the letter but the

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>that she seems closest to anarchism. She wanted to replace systen

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>tariat&quot;1), and she believed that economic independence through
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>socially productive labor was the key to women’s freedom.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Because of this, she thought at first that the destruction of private

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>later recognized the difference between the role of women’s rights
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>for bourgeois women and for working-class women. Middle-class
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>women could focus on issues of personal liberation and more
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>individual concerns, while working-class women, exploited as
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>women and as workers, did not have that kind of leisure. Because

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>of women. Because of her feminism, Zetkin was victimized by the

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>when the anarchists joined the Popular Front government, she
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>had become a popular leader, as well as the leading anarchist
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>theoretician, and was appointed Minister of Health and Social
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Services. Although she was criticized for accepting the “reform

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>affected by her sense of responsibility to society, and especially to
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>women. While she worked for change in many areas — educa
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>tion, prison reform, abolishing the death penalty —she was pri
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>marily committed to changing the status of women. Within the
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>deeply embedded Spanish patriarchal tradition, she realized that
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>anarchist revolution alone could help women only economically;
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>social attitudes would have to change if women were to be secure
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>and independent. While in office, she drafted a law legalizing
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>abortion and argued for birth control and the legal reform of
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>prostitution, which she considered a result of rigid sexual rela
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>tions and women’s lack of significant work. Yet, like Goldman
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>and Kollantai, Montseny was not a &quot;feminist,” and criticized the

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>enced communism. Anarchist and feminist emphasis is on the

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>education. Many anarchist attitudes are seen as culturally female
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>— the emphasis on intuition, instinct, feeling and spontaneity, the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>distrust of logic as authoritarian and dominating. While anarch

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>may be that this rebellion against all patriarchal institutions is

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sees freedom only in liberation from men (separatism). As the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Spanish experience of feminism shows, permanent liberation
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>depends upon a total social structure. Sexism must be fought as

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>plained without it, but it must always be recalled that feminism is
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>only part of the primary focus on class contradiction. The history
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of the socialist struggle in Russia and China, of feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>anarchism, and even of the Weather Underground, shows how

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>exaggerated by male habits of dominance.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Anarchist tendencies in feminism could come from two
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sources. The first is the concept that women are &quot;naturally” more
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>anarchistic because woman’s “nature&quot; is closer to the earth, to the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>anarchist idea of the &quot;natural state.&quot; The second possibility is his
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>torical and cultural. Women have been excluded from full par
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ticipation in government and industry, and have been confined to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the smaller, more immediate contexts of family and community
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>where harmony and cooperation are desirable and important.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Because talk, gossip and expressing emotion were for so long the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>only expressions permitted women, direct contact in small groups
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>seemed appropriate and necessary for the beginning of social
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>transformation. But there have always been at least two women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>movements. The middle-class movement, historically originating
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>from the free time and the good education that permit women to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>rebel against the emptiness of their leisure and the absurdity of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>female roles, has been able to concentrate on issues of personal
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ity, personal freedom, structures of language and art, social inter
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>action and individual response to conditions of oppression. More
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>recently, middle-class women have been able to work in small
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>groups in an attempt to build up mutual confidence. The work
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ing-class women’s movement, on the other hand, has sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>been invisible because it has been aligned with socialist struggles
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and unionism. For these women, oppressed by class as well as by
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>sexism, feminism is not usually the primary strategy; they seek
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>more immediate changes, tied to conditions in the working place,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>and often ignore their extension in the home. While their de
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>mands are often feminist —for equal pay, pay during maternity
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>leave, day-care centers —these are sought within sexually inte
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>grated contexts. The task now seems to bring these two feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>movements together.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Anarchism presents an unresolvable contradiction. How can
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it be achieved in a world where everything is leading toward
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>greater centralization? As soon as anarchists begin to build prac
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tical systems, they are forced to approach a more centralized
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>communism through the necessity for concentration of capital.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>But in spite of this contradiction, anarchism is important, par
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ticularly to women. Perhaps it can’t be put into effect unless allied
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with another system (socialism, communism); perhaps it has to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>serve as a constant criticism of authoritarianism, bureaucracy,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>paternalism, protesting the erosion or obfuscation of liberty. Its
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>role may be to serve as a moral reminder that social change is,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and always should be, for people.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>There is a lesson in all of this: if in the entire history of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women’s struggles, we have been opposed to authoritarianism
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and hierarchy, it is masochistic and self-destructive to align femi
