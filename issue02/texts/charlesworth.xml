				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>loudspeakers, no stewards, no prepared order of service. Just
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>a vast throng of women, gathered at the spot where shortly
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>before, the war between the terrorists and the army had cost
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the lives of three children.... One had a gnawing uneasiness
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that nothing more was going to happen
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>What did happen was a sudden burst of derisive yells
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and taunts from a band of youths defiantly brandishing the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tricolour flag from a vantage point on the roof of a nearby
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>garage. At that moment perhaps nothing could more effec

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>what we were there to do. From one to another the word
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>threaded like quicksilver through the crowds: “We’re goin
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to walk down to the Falls.&quot; And walk we did—pushchairs
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and all —along the road that has become so notorious for
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>violence and anger. Here and there spectators jeered ana

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>column of women — in the most casual fashion — walked on.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>As we walked, we talked. “They say,&quot; said the woman

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ejaculations of welcome fell on my ears. I felt simultaneously

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In August 1976, there emerged in Belfast, Northern Ireland
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>apparently quite &quot;spontaneously,” a movement, which althougl
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>it was later to be dubbed “The People for Peace” movement, was
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>quite without a doubt a women’s movement, initiated, supported
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and sustained primarily by women. From the perspective of cla
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sic political forms, it was and is both extremely traditional and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>profoundly radical, and it is particularly within the context o
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Irish politics that it becomes so.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>My initial interest in the peace movement grew out of a feel
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing of solidarity and empathy with both the frustration and the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>positive vision these women revealed. As I followed its progress
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my interest began to turn increasingly to its larger political and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>social implications, not simply in relation to the situation of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Northern Ireland, but also in regard to basic issues posed by femi

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>practice. What became increasingly apparent as I continued my
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>research was the fact that the peace movement could not be
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>understood and evaluated either on the basis of the primar,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>social-political traditions of Northern Ireland or from the per
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>spective of an abstract marxist or feminist analysis. These model

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The Province of Ulster was born in conflict. The partition of

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>war, or a war of national liberation is in many ways a false one. It
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>is all of these at once. The peculiar complexity of the situation
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>stems from the fact that the political and religious identity of each

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Peace and Freedom, headed by Jane Addams, sent their own
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>commission to study Irish self-rule, clearly opposing the interests
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of their own government. The Irish section of the WILPF, led by
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Louie Bennett, was active in organizing women to employ
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>passive-resistance techniques in a struggle against the British.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Their view as women was that human life was precious and that

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The peace movement, as Bernadette Devlin has pointed out,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is not a feminist movement. There is in fact virtually no feminism

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>While there have been several notable female political activists in

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>is still a major obstacle. While as citizens of a Commonwealth

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>pay, and according to an anti-discrimination law passed at West

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>European women as well. While the legal status of Ulster women
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>is superior to that of women in the Catholic Republic of Ireland
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>where women still have almost no independent legal rights, a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>very strong patriarchal ideology still prevails throughout Ireland,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and Northern Irish women are for the most part still politically
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>subservient to their husbands as well as being educationally and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>economically disadvantaged. While these conditions can ulti

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>How then can we evaluate the effectiveness of the peace

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>an important step forward in both of these directions. The self

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>among working-class women. It is certainly true that there has

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Marin de Burca, a socialist and leader of Sinn Fein (Official
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>IRA) spoke of the peace movement in an interview during a re

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>issued statements supporting them, but I don’t agree with trying

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>through unification of the various factions around initially mod

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to unite Protestants and Catholics. If we have to look
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>for something that sounds as reactionary as peace, then
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>we look for it. If people can’t see behind the facade to
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the reality then it’s their problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>When Marin de Burca speaks of working in a political way
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to unite Catholics and Protestants, she is speaking as a marxist
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>attempting to organize working people to assume greater econo
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>mic control. While, as a member of the Official IRA, de Burca
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>definitely supports an anti-imperialist struggle, she feels that in
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the long run the sectarian disputes dividing the Catholic and Prot-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>estant working populations are perhaps an even greater obstacle
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to the struggle for self-determination. As the situation exists now,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>separate Catholic and Protestant labor unions render the labor
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>movement as a whole relatively ineffectual, and continued eco
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>nomic disintegration due to sectarian violence has left large sec
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tions of the Catholic and Protestant population unemployed.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It is interesting to note the difference between de Burca&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>marxist analysis, which views the entire Irish working class as the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>oppressed class and the type of marxist analysis supported by
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>other Republicans, which views the Catholic minority in the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>North as the oppressed class. The Provisionals, who are not nec
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>essarily socialists but prefer to think of themselves as consistently
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>on the left, persist in opposing both the British and the Protestan
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>paramilitary and are engaged in a constant struggle for unifica
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tion with the Catholic South. Bernadette Devlin, a socialist and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>an aggressive Republican, generally supports this form of analysis
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>where class—purely in economic terms—is secondary to anti
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>imperialism and a class analysis stressing the political and eco
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>nomic discrimination that the Catholic population as a whole has
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>suffered at the hands of a Protestant-controlled government and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>industry.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The complexity of the situation and the relative inadequacy
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of this approach is apparent when one considers, even in crude
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>terms, the economic composition of the Catholic and Protestant
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>population. While it is definitely true that the Protestant majori-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ty, as a group, has greater economic control, and that the high
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>est levels of unemployment in the North are in Catholic districts,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the large majority of the Protestant population is also working
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>class. It is, in fact, the youths of these two communities who are
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>fighting one another, while the small minority of Protestants who
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>are wealthy maintain an economic advantage and have an inter

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>It would be a mistake, however, to attempt to evaluate the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>significance of the peace movement on the basis of its potential
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>effectiveness in furthering the cause of other political movements.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>It is perhaps more useful to consider the way in which the peace
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>movement is indicative of an entirely different struggle for self
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>determination, as well as a profoundly different approach to these
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>issues. It is significant that what is being questioned by the peace
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>people is not the ends of political struggle so much as the means
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>by which ideas, opinions and interests are both culturally rein
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>forced and socially imposed.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>The critical issue which is the historical source of internal
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Irish conflict is that of the relationship between Ireland and the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>British Empire. This has not only kept Catholics and Protestants
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>feuding for generations, but has also led to innumerable splits
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>within both camps. It is paradoxical that within this contex
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>British imperialism is the one issue on which the peace campaign
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>has most consistently refused to take a stand. This is not because

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>For the peace people, the question of the relative legitimacy
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of opposing traditions is momentarily suspended. What is reveal
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ed instead is the logical perfection of institutionalized conflict.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Military, political and even religious leaders are themselves to

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the Irish people divided among themselves. “Rationality” is for
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>them not merely a question of “right&quot; and “wrong,” but rather
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>begins with the realization of how two non-dialectical visions of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;right&quot; are sustained by a culture which is imperialist and author
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>itarian in its very mode of thought.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Problems arise, claim the peace workers, because we have
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>lost sight of a basic respect for the individual.&quot; &quot;Solutions,&quot; they
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>assert, cannot be artificially constructed and then imposed but
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>must arise through a process of creative interaction in which gov
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ernment does not exist to control people, to violently suppress
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>dissent, but rather as an extension of the more or less clearly arti
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>culated needs and desires of all the people.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>These concepts, while they may reveal an element of political
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>naiveté which translates as liberalism, are not rhetorical. The
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>practical orientation of the movement to date, with its emphasis
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>on open and careful discussion and a decentralized approach to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>developing democratic forms, is indicative of this fact.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>From this perspective we might examine Bernadette Devlin&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>claim that the peace movement is “dangerous&quot; because it “dulls
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>consciousness. “We were stupid,” she claims, “never to have or
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ganized the women.&quot;10 Both the truth and the potential fallacy of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>this statement are apparent. From the standpoint of almost any
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>traditional political perspective, assertions of the sanctity of life,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of respect for the individual and of a genuine “creative form of

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>tions; the values themselves must define the very process of po

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Bernadette’s regret at not having &quot;organized&quot; the women? Is it
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>conceivable that the women supporting the peace movement are
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>not in fact organizing themselves, organizing in such a way as to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>deny the legitimacy of those very political forms into which
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>others seek to recruit them?
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>A supportive statement by the Provisionals, in which the

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women are most directly challenging.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>We are not necessarily in opposition to the peace people.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>But we want to explain to the people that there cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>be peace without justice. We just want to explain to the

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>This raises the most subtle and yet critical issue of the peace
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>movement’s significance. The whole notion of a “true position” is
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>what the peace movement calls into question—it is not the politi
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>cal views of the opposing factions that are being attacked; even
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the &quot;violence” the movement condemns is but a manifestation of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>something far more profoundly significant. The peace people are,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>in my opinion, not reacting simply to a specific incident of vio
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>lence, nor even to violence in the abstract. They are (perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>naively but nevertheless insightfully) challenging a whole tradi
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>tion. What is fundamentally being questioned is the legitimacy of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the imposition of the will of one group upon another. “Justice” is
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>not being challenged so much as how justice is socially defined.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>imperialism, in this context, is not simply a question of national
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>or international conquest. Imperialism is the imposition of a so

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>&quot;is an imperialist question” because it implies the imposition of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>political forms by politicians on people who are for the most part
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>excluded from the process of a creative democracy. Thus all ex

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to secure them.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>From this perspective, British colonialism, Protestant politi

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>logical phenomenon. While it would be absurd to consider the

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>es values that are fundamentally in accordance with both socialist
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and feminist thought, in that it addresses the whole issue of power
