               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Betty Bonnet was her name. She was the one with all the
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>hats. One had a grey plume that stuck out the top. Mother said i
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was ostrich. Betty was only a little girl, maybe twelve or thirteen
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>But she had the most beautiful clothes — coats with fur collars
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>brown velvet dresses with white lace around the neck for parties.
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>She had such pink cheeks. Her hair fell in long curls from under
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the hat. I wanted to be her. I wanted to take her out of her com
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>partment and play with her. Take the dresses and choose for
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>myself. Fold the paper tabs over her shoulders. She would go to
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>school, she would be the prettiest. She would be me. I would
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>make her lovely for everyone. Like Mother said I was to be when
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I had to sit still so she could brush my hair, parting each side for
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>braids. She pulled tight; pulled and twisted each braid with her
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>strong hands.
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mother said no. Not until you are older and know how to
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>touch them. They are fragile. Paper. Betty was her favorite. All
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>those years living between the yellowing pages of the magazine
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that smelled like the closet in Grandmother’s house. Each doll had
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>a place, with all her dresses, her hats. One had a fur piece with
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>just enough space for the head to fit through. It was Betty’s older
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sister. Mother had a fox stole too. Sometimes she wore it to
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>parties. She is my mother. They are her dolls.
            </p>
            <p>
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>One day I was allowed to play with Betty, just Betty. Mother
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>went to the heavy chest in the dining room. She took out the box
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tied with strings. She was a child too. She hid things. She hid
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>things from me. She didn’t want me to know. Betty was her
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>favorite, my favorite. She had the best clothes. When I touched
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her the paper felt like silk. I chose the blue dress with buttons
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>down the front and legs attached. Her high shoes matched. She
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>matched perfectly. I asked Mother if that’s the way she dressed
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>when she was twelve. Be careful, she said.
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>She tightens the braid until it hurts. Now look for yourself in
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the mirror, look. She slips my head between the slit in the hat, she
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tells me to smile. In the mirror I am beautiful. In the mirror I am
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>paper; I am flat, flattened. I am to be placed somewhere and she
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>is cutting.
               <lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Cate Abbe won the Academy of American Poets Award at San Francisco
