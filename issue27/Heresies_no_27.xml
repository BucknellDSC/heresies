				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Heresies is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>examination of art and politics from a feminist per
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>spective. We believe that what is commonly called
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>art can have a political impact and that in the making
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of art and all cultural artifacts our identities as women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>play a distinct role. We hope that Heresies continues
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to stimulate dialogue around radical political and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>aesthetic theory as well as to generate new creative
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>energies among women. It is a place where diversity
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>can be articulated. We are committed to broadening
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Heresies is published by a collective of feminists,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>some of whom are also socialists, marxists, lesbian
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feminists, or anarchists; our fields include painting,

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>mother collective and other women interested in that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>theme. Heresies provides experience for women who

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the international feminist community.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connec
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tions between our lives, our arts, and our ideas have
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>been suppressed. Once these connections are clari
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>fied, they can function as a means to dissolve the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>alienation between artist and audience and to under
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>stand the relationship between art and politics, worl
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and workers. As a step toward the demystification of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>art within the present system, which has often
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>become the relationship of advertiser to product. We
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>will not advertise a new set of genius-products just
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>because they are made by women. We are not com

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>competitive mentality that pervades the art world.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Our view of feminism is one of process and change,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and we feel that through this dialogue we can foster

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The collective process
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>behind this 27th issue of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Heresies began five years ago.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The original title was “Viva Latinal&quot; — eventually discarded
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>because of its evocation of clicking castanets, ruffled skirts, and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Carmen Miranda hats. Latina is an awkward label to encompass the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cultural diversity of two continents over the course of more than five cen
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>turies. In the U.S. the term becomes almost ludicrous when the majority outside
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>a porous border becomes a &quot;minority” within. History has shifted borders geographi
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>cally, politically, and economically, and Latina carries much historical baggage.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>From the beginning there was consensus among the editorial collective that the issue was to focus on
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>cultural identity. Our potential contributors — artists, writers, poets, dancers, filmmakers, sociologists, lawyers,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>activists, art critics &amp; historians — had long been engaged (with themselves and one another) in a dialogue on the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>topic. This issue of Heresies, renamed “Latina—A Journal of Ideas,” pays tribute to the rich variety of expression in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>women’s creative work — rigorous &amp; free, profound and funny, timeless &amp; contemporary.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>During the five years of the issue’s development, questions of identity in the domain of cultural/multicultural power rela
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>tionships have become even more overt and complex, and the question of difference in ethnic and racial identity has
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>become more and more central to cultural, sociological, and philosophical debate around the world. The importance of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>Latinas’ contributions to this dialogue has become increasingly clear.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>A decade of broadening discourse has thus led to reenvisioning the cultural community that is the United States, bul
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>systemic change has been uneven. Major mainstream cultural institutions continue to mount the occasional definitive
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>authoritative Latin American art exhibition. Frequently the scholarship and curatorial premises are problematic. Women
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>have too often been underrepresented. Latino artists living in the U.S. have recently been omitted as well. One may ques
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>tion the contribution these large, transient exhibitions make to the field of art history. Do they herald an alteration of rou
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>tine curatorial practice, or are they finite, self-limiting events intended to mollify a constituency? The re-evaluation of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>cultural community has created new funding opportunities. Major institutions outmaneuver grassroots institutions for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>multicultural arts and education funding, repositioning themselves in the face of impending demographic shifts
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>In this landscape of shifting cultural borders, we of the “Latina” collective hope this issue of Heresies will help expand
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>the ongoing discourse of self-definition. The initial editorial collective outlined the mission of the issue as the creatior
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>of a space for women of Latin American descent living or working primarily within the U.S., a space where Latinas
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>could speak and listen to their own creative voices — room for her own. Following the first call for submissions, the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>project was delayed at various points. The collective tried several methods of opening up the editorial process. A
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>debate about the politics of accepting National Endowment for the Arts money in an atmosphere of censorship inter
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>rupted work for a time. Simultaneously, much-needed funds from the New York State Council on the Arts were being
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>drastically cut across the board.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>The method used to compile this final version of “Latina—A Journal of Ideas” evolved as an attempt to respond to the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>diversity contained within the term Latina. Acknowledging that a three-member editorial collective could not presume to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>represent the multiple communities of the Latin diaspora, an invitation was extended to two dozen Latina artists, writers
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>and scholars across the U.S. Each of the respondents was asked to compile a 4-6 page segment for the issue. A dozer
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>segments emerged from this process; two were contributed by members of the collective. To these was added a portfolio
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>selected by the collective, culled from unsolicited material sent directly to Heresies or solicited by us from some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>artists whose work we felt should be present in the issue. Avis Lang provided general editorial and administrative sup
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>port; her infinite patience and good humor were essential to the project. The innovative work of artist/designer Ana
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>Linnemann involved a true collaboration with the material — personal yet respectful of the contributors’ ideas and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>images. We owe special thanks to art activist/critic/Heresies cofounder Lucy Lippard. Her generous quidance and advice
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>have been invaluable
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>Although this issue of Heresies exceeds the usual length, it does not begin to exhaust the topic. True to the range of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>Latinas’ expressive forms and to our intentions, it offers a kaleidoscopic rather than an authoritative survey. Within the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>open forum of Heresies it integrates approaches and issues previously perceived as disparate. We hope Latinas will con
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>tinue to see this forum as theirs

				<lb facs='#facs_7_l' n='N001'/>DREAM: ADA
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I am on the subway to the Bronx. A group of Latin women
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>have asked me to coordinate a Latin American festival. Iarrive at a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>park and go to some picnic benches where the meeting is taking place. I can feel the brightness of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>the sun, and when I look up at the sky it is perfectly clear and blue. The grass around the picnic
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>tables is moist and glimmers brightly green; at a distance is a woods of enormous pines. It all seems
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>very regal. There is a hum of activity. Women are distributing food and refreshments to those at the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>meeting. I notice a thin, slightly built man collecting dues. Everyone is very happy and excited
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>because it will be a beautiful festival as well as an important political event. I meet the women I will
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>be working with and am told that the festival will comprise a parade, music, dancing, food vending
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>of Latin American delicacies, and displays of indigenous costumes. I learn that the event is to be for
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>pure Latin Americans. Then I realize that the women at the meeting are wearing two kinds of cos
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>tumes: indigenous or western. In their indigenous clothing they appear very beautiful but unreal-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>like people on a movie set. When I ask one woman about this,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>she tells me that the outfit will attract tourists. I nod. The
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>Western clothing, by contrast, is unflattering, shabby dresses
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>something one could imagine a woman wearing so as not
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>to ruin good clothes. I ask the same woman about this, and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>she again tells me, matter-of-factly, that these outfits will bring
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>in tourists. I wonder who the tourists will be if this is to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>festival for pure Latin Americans. The woman goes on talking
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>The rest of society will see that our festival is taking place; we
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>have to accommodate our image to their expectations.” Then
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>she laughs and says, “But we know who we are.” I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>understand. Her words leave me consumed with self-doubt. I
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>have learned I will be in charge of public relations. I wonder
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>which kind. Is the work I will do for the tourists, the “rest of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>society,” or for the pure Latin Americans? I also wonder what
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>they mean by pure. Costumes aside, I saw only European-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>looking women at the meeting — no Indians or blacks.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>I am on the subway, returning from the meeting. I am
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>with a black woman friend, describing the festival to her. She
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>is very supportive and asks questions. She wants to know the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>date because she would like to attend. I am very worried
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>about this. All I can say is, &quot;They told me the festival is only
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>for Latin Americans.&quot; She very seriously reveals that her
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>great-grandmother was Cuban. I nod, more uncomfortable
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>than before, somehow I know this is not what the group has
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>in mind, and it is very disturbing. I feel I should not work on
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>this festival. I wonder if the women think I am a pure Latin
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>American. Is this the way I view myself? Is this how I want
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>society to view me? I keep remembering the sureness of the woman’s response: But we know who
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>we are.&quot; Did she mean that in fact we don&apos;t know? I don’&apos;t know much about my ancestors, but I
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>believe they come from all over. Every once in a while some aunt of mine &quot;lets a cat out of the bag,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>which the other aunts emphatically deny. Do my aunts know?
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>I now notice that the man who was collecting dues at the meeting has been standing in the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>train, listening. I am certain he can read my mind. He makes me nervous. He casually asks me how
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>many people went to the meeting. Afraid he may think I cannot do a good job at public relations, I lie.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>About eight people had been present, but I come up with a different figure. He nods, as if reas
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>sured, and exits at the next stop. As the doors close, I realize he had collected the dues and the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>numbers will not add up when he counts the money Will he think me a thief or know l&apos;m a liar?

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N002'/>ENGLISH
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N003'/>LESSON: DINA
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N004'/>Shortly after I arrived
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N005'/>in this country, I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>applied for a job at

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Christmas season.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>There was no interview; however, I had to do a simple
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>math test. I did it well and was then given a large but
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ton to wear that read CASHIER TRAINEE. I and many
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>others would undergo training for two weeks. Then we
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>would have to pass a test in order to be hired for the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>whole season.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>All of this I learned from a Puerto Rican man whom
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I had asked to interpret for me. My English was very
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>poor at that time. Fortunately there were many Puerto
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Ricans in the group, and they took me under their
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wing. They whispered (so that my lack of English
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wouldn’t be noticed) all about credit cards, sales tax,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>price codes, exchanges, making change, counting
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>money, rolls of coins, coffee breaks, and fire exits.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I learned every word by heart and practiced at home.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I had lunch every day with them, and I was
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>touched by their friendliness, warmth, and wit. Soon
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>they decided they had to interpret another kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>information: “Beware of the Jews,” I was warned. I pre
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tended to have a temporary hearing problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>With a faltering voice I passed the test. I was given
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>another large button that read CASHIER— DINA
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>BURSZTYN.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I was assigned to a cash register next to a heavy
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>white woman. She put her glasses on to read my name.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>“Where did you say you were from?”
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>“I didn’t say but I am from Argentina.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Ah, there’s a large Jewish community there.”
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>I nodded.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>She and the other Jews took me under their wing.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>They helped me with my newly acquired cashiering

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the Puerto Ricans,” I was warned. I pretended my Eng-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lish was failing me.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>All this time the manager of the greeting cards

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>While having lunch all by myself, I decided I had
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>learned more than I had intended. I quit the job, but
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>similar experiences never quit me. Sometimes I laugh,

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dear Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>This time when I heard you reading my letter on the radio I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>feel even a pinch of embarrassment. On the contrary, I looked at myself in
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the mirror and I said to myself (in English, because l am learning and practic
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing it), “You are the best, Corazone,” but when I heard my gringa accent on
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>my name I got nervous and I ran to the kitchen to make tortillas so as not to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>forget who I am. And I started to ask myself if that business of thinking of
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>oneself as “the best” is a gringo thing and that I can&apos;t think like that because it
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>is like a betrayal of what my mother taught me.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Mamá always used to say that it was the obligation of the woman
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to always put herself in second place and ever complain, and never, never
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>did I see Mamá talking to herself in the mirror! The few times that I saw her
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>even looking at herself in the mirror, it was only to rapidly brush her hair, as
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>she said it, her long hair of a lost woman, and make it up into the eternal
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>bun of the surrendered woman, although one time I did hear a little sound
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>come out of her mouth like a little bird of sighs and misplaced dreams.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>But I realize that I do not want the life that Mamá had, although it
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was a good life, rich and full of affection, children, geraniums, and patience,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and that there is nothing wrong in being different, and it would be a betrayal to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>myself and my people to not take the opportunity to be “the best,” lo mejor.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>And when I listened to your program about the course that teaches
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>how to discreate the beliefs that are limiting us, I understood that the beliefs
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>with which I grew up are good as long as they benefit me, my family, and my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>community today, and that what I have to learn is to be able to tell the differ
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ence between the good that Mamá taught me and that which is no longer use
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ful. And if they call me “Corazone” I will not get nervous; I will merely smile
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>at the poor gringos that have such a hard time learning Spanish!

				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Sunday the advice you gave on your program about solving prob

				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the best. I started to think of my great-grandmother, Maclovia of the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Hands of Heaven. They called her that because she was a sobadora, and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>so great was her fame that they say that Pancho Villa himself travelled
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ninety miles just to know, before he died, what it was like to feel those
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>miraculous hands on his tired and anxious hero’s body. They say that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>afterwards his words to Maclovia were, “Now I know what victory is.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>And when he died, the word travelled back to my great-grandmother
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that among his last words were heard, “Maclovia, I will look for your
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hands of heaven in paradise.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_18_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Well, I think that they invented all of that, but take note that that

				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>pensar en mi bisabuela, Maclovia de las Manos de Manjar, así le decían porque era
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sobadora y tanta era su fama que dicen que el mismo Pancho Villa viajó noventa millas
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>solo para antes de morir saber lo que era sentir esas manos milagrosas en su cuerpo de
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>héroe cansado y ansioso. Dicen que sus palabras a Maclovia despues fueron, “Ahora sé lo
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>que es la victoria.” Y cuando el murió le vinieron las noticias a mi bisabuela que entre
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sus últimas palabras se escuchó, “Maclovia, buscaré tus Manos de Manjar en el Paraíso.”
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Bueno, creo que todo eso lo inventaron, pero, fíjate que
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>esa noche a Angel le comenzó a doler el cuello por un
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tropiezo que había tenido en el trabajo. Yo, acordándome
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>de lo que me enseñó mi bisabuela Maclovia, le comencé
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a sobar y pronto se le quitó el dolor. Le contó esto a

				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>masaje porque le dolía la espalda. Después del
				<lb facs='#facs_19_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>masaje me pagó treinta dólares y me dijo que

				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dear Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>In just one week I have had four clients in my new career as a sobadora. The first
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>already told you was Laura, the wife of John (my boyfriend Angel’s boss), and she rec
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ommended me to the others, one woman and two men. With the women everything
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>went very well, but the truth is that I got nervous with the idea of giving a massage to
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a man. But I drank a strong chamomile tea (without honey), I crossed myself three
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>times, and I put on my best sour-old-lady face, and everything went well. He kept his
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>towel covering his private gifts of God, and I even found a blockage in his stomach
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>which, with the help of the Holy Spirit, Iloosened up and started on its way out.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Then for Eddie, the second male client, I was all confident. But I don’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>if it’s because I didn’t drink the chamomile tea, l didn’t cross myself, or because l came
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in with a smile of a monkey who just fell off a coconut tree, but everything went
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>wrong. First his towel fell down. Or maybe Eddie (who does business with John,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Angel’s boss) dropped it on purpose, because when I went to pick it up he said never
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>mind, that he preferred the massage without a towel.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Istarted to massage him face down, and I noticed that he was warm and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>swollen on his left side, and I commented on it. That was when he grabbed my hand
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and told me, “T’II show you where l’m really hot,” pulling my hand toward you know
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>where. I let out a shout of “No!” sounding like a sad and sick cat, and I pulled my hand
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>back, but he grabbed me again and hard, this time trying to force me on top of him
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>while pulling off my clothes. In that moment, I swear, Consuelo, the image of the
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Angel of Jigsaw Puzzles (the mysterious puzzle of a mestizo angel that my son Jandro
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>had put together) came into my head; then I started to feel dizzy and nauseous, and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the better part of my lunch of rice, refried beans, and eggs ended up on top of Eddie’s
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>private gifts of God.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ran out, hearing his obscenities and his shouts that if I told anyone he
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>would see to it that my boyfriend Angel lost his job. You can’t imagine how awful
				<lb facs='#facs_21_tr_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>feel: violated, contaminated, and threatened. I don’t know what to do, but don’t be

				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Estimada Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>En solo una semana ya he tenido cuatro clientes en mi nueva carrera de sobadora. La
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>primera ya te conté fue Laura, la esposa de John (el patrón de Angel), y ella me recomendó a los
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>otros, una mujer y dos hom bres. Con las mujeres me fue muy bien, pero la verdad es que me
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>puse nerviosa con la idea de darle un masaje a un hombre, pero me tomé un fuerte té de man-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>zanilla (sin miel), me persigné tres veces y me use mi mejor cara de vieja arremangada, y todo
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>nos fue bien, él se mantuvo con la toalla tapándole sus regalos privados de Dios, y yo hasta le
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>encontré un empacho en el estómago que, con la ayuda del Espíritu Santo, aflojé y puse en
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>marcha afuera.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Entonces ya para Eddie, el segundo cliente hombre, me tenías toda confiada. Pero no sé
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>si es porque no me tomé el té de manzanilla, no me persigné o entré con una sonrisa de mono
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>recién caído de mata de coco, pero todo me fue mal. Primero se le cayó la toalla, o quizás
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Eddie, que hace negocioscon John (el patrón de Angel) la hizo caer a propósito, porque cuan-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>do la fuí a recojer dijo, “Never mind,” que preferiría el masaje sin toalla.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Comencé a masajearlo de boca abajo y me fijé que tenía
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>un bulto como caliente en el costado izquierdo y se lo comen
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>té. Entonces fue cuando él me agarró la mano y me dijo, “T’ll
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>show you where l’m really hot,” jalándome la mano hacia ya
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tú sabes donde. Me salió un grito de “No!” como de gato
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>enfermo y triste y jalé mi mano para atrás, pero él me
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>agarró de nuevo y duro, esta vez tratando de forzarme
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>encima de él, mientras trataba de desvestirme. En ese
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>momento, te juro, Consuelo, me entró la imagen del
				<lb facs='#facs_22_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Angel de los Rompecabezas (el misterioso

				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dear Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>have never felt such a big mix of feelings and thoughts in such a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>short space of time like I have felt this last week. It reminds me of one
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Three Kings Day when I was nine years old and the cat gave birth to eleven
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>kittens, but my father put them all in a sack and drowned them in the river,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>saying that we already had cats.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>My first thought was to go to the police to report him (not my father
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Eddie), but then after thinking about it a little, I realized that it wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>be of much use. Anyway, it was only attempted rape, and besides, I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>have any proof. Who were they going to believe: Eddie, with his latest mod
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>el seep Cherokee and his smile of the Marlboro cowboy, or Corazón, the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Mexican sobadora without papers? Forget it.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>My next dilemma was whether to tell Angel or not. He would probably
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feel obligated to defend my honor, and he would go out in search of Eddie,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>who he would find in a bar full of his friends and loaded rifles. Forget it.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>At the least, Angel would get angry at me for going around giving
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>massages to men with blond hair, and he would try to prevent me from
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>continuing my career as a miraculous sobadora, although the miraculous
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>seems to be turning into the disastrous. Forget it.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>And if I told Laura, she would tell sohn who would tell Eddie who
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>would invent something horrible so that John would fire Angel. Forget it.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>But what if Eddie asks for another massage? I feel so alone, alone with
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>my shame, anger, and disgust — and fear, fear of losing it, all because of one
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cruel (or stupid) man. The only thing that gives me pleasure is the memory
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of his face when he saw my lunch of rice, refried beans, and eggs shoot from
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>my mouth on top of his private gifts of God. It was another miracle, Con
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>suelo; my Angel of the Jigsaw Puzzles protected me with the Miracle of the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_tr_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Vomited Lunch. That, at least, reminds me what it is like to smile.

				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>feminist ideas; she told him that the only thing he cared about was money. He
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>told her to go to the devil; she told him to go to a worse place.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>At the same time, Angel screams at me because I told Laura, that
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>women talk too much, that he never liked that I go around as a sobadora, that
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>as undocumented ones we don’t have the right to complain if someone abuses
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>us, and I scream back that as a human being nobody has the right to abuse me,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that it is time that women scream to the world the truth and that men learn
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that they no longer can do whatever they want with us. And that my great
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>grandmother Maclovia of the Hands of Heaven had taught me her wisdom and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>her secrets so that I could share them without shame and help to alleviate the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>pain in the world like she did during more than eighty years of massaging and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>making miracles.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Oh, Consuelo, I don’t know how this is going to end, but I feel like a

				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>A los huevos revueltos de mi vida ahora se ha juntado el chile picante.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Cuando John se enteró que su esposa, Laura, había ido al fiscal a ofrecerle un
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>testigo (yo) contra su cliente, Eddie, que está siendo enjuiciado por violar a otra
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mujer, se armó una buena, ya te imaginas. Laura me dice que su esposo la llamó
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>imbecil, ella lo llamó criminal. El le dijo que con sus emociones malpuestas iba a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>destruir vidas, ella le dijo que los hombres violan, destruyen vidas y despues se prote-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>gen unos a los otros. El le dijo que lo único que le importaba a ella eran sus ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>feministas egoístas, ella le dijo que lo único que le importaba a él era el dinero. El le
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>dijo que se fuera al diablo, ella le dijo que se fuera a un sitio peor.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Al mismo tiempo Angel me grita que porqué le conté a Laura, que las
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>mujeres hablan mucho, que nunca le gustó que yo andara de sobadora, que como
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>indocumentados no tenemos derecho a quejarnos si alguien abusa de nosotros, y
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>yo le grito que como ser humano, nadie tiene el derecho de abusar de mí, que ya
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>es tiempo que la mujer grite al mundo la verdad y que el hombre aprenda que ya
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>no puede hacer lo que quiere con nosotras. Y que mi bisabuela sobadora Maclovia
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>de las Manos de Manjar me había enseñado su sabiduría y sus secretos para que yo
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>los compartiera sin vergüenza y ayudara a aliviar el dolor en el mundo como ella lo
				<lb facs='#facs_28_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>hizo durante más de ochenta años de sobar y

				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dear Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>The good news is that Angel has finally gotten his papers,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with the help of John, and he is documented and ecstatic. He says that
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>he feels as if he had been buried under the earth in a dark and humid
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>place full of whispers and covered mouths. And now, he says, he can
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>go out into the light and shout shouts of all colors and sing, sing, sing
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>without being afraid that they will see his hat.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Iam happy for him, but the bad news is that John found out
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>where Laura and I are living and has come already three nights in a
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>row to bother Laura. She doesn’t let him in, but from outside he plays
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>music on the stereo for her, he reads love letters to her and poetry,
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>he swears that he will never harm her again, but sometimes he gets
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>angry and then I have to cover my son Jandro’s ears because the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>shouts are of all colors, but strong colors. And last night he brought
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the very bad news that Eddie was threatening to denounce me to the
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Immigration if I testify in his trial.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>feel like shouting too, in full color, Consuelo, all the bad
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>words of all the world in all the languages and from all history, but
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>then I start to think, Why dirty the world more? Laura tells me that
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>should express my frustration and anger, but I don’t want to scare
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Jandro, and besides, I remember what my great-grandmother Maclovia
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>of the Hands of Heaven taught me — that “a sobadora is like an artist
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>who uses colors with conscience and wisdom; she does not throw
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>them in the air but mixes them and applies them with love and
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>patience; that is how you will live your life; that is how you will heal.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Consuelo, whatever happens, my shouts of all colors will be
				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>songs of love like those of our villages, sweet and strong like mestizo

				<lb facs='#facs_30_tr_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with the patience of centuries and the hope of a better world.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Las buenas noticias son que Angel ha conseguido al fin sus papeles, con la ayuda
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>de John, y está documentado y estasiado, dice que se siente como que ha estado enterra-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>do bajo la tierra en un sitio oscuro y húmedo y lleno de susurros y bocas tapadas. Y ahora
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>dice que puede salir a la luz y gritar gritos de todos colores y cantar, cantar, cantar sin
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>miedo que le vean el sombrero.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Estoy feliz por él, pero las malas noticias son que John averiguó donde yo y
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Laura estábamos viviendo y ha venido ya tres noches seguidas a molestar a Laura. Ella no lo
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>deja entrar pero el de afuera le toca música en su estéreo, le lee cartas de amor y poesía,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>le jura que nunca más le va a hacer daño, pero a veces se enoja y entonces le tengo que
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tapar las orejas a mi hijo Jandro porque los gritos sí son de todos colores, pero colores
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>fuertes. Y anoche trajo la muy mala noticia que Eddie está amenazando con denunciarme
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>a la Immigración si yo doy testimonio en su juicio.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Me dan ganas de gritar yo también a todo color, Consuelo, todas

				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pero no quiero asustar a Jandro y además me acuerdo lo que me
				<lb facs='#facs_31_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>enseñó mi bisabuelo Maclovia de las Manos de Manjar que “una

				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dear Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Yesterday they called me as a witness against Eddie in his trial for
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>raping Dr. Goodman. When I told them about the Miracle of the Vomited
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Lunch, that I was able to escape from Eddie when I vomited on top of his
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>private gifts of God, I saw some little smiles on them. Even the judge had to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cover his mouth so that we would not see him laughing. But when I told
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>them about my great-grandmother Maclovia of the Hands of Heaven, who
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>had taught me the art of being a sobadora, I saw them very interested. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>started to massage their necks, others to move their heads from one side
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to the other; all their bodies seemed to be moving, asking help from my
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>hands.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>And I remembered one time that my great-grandmother Maclovia
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>had said to me, “Corazoncito, the body does not lie; words can be like vel
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>vet of the devil, but the body tells the truth,” and l asked myself if the judge
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>knew how to read bodies or if he let himself get fooled by words. And then
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Ilooked at Eddie, the accused, and I felt pity — he looked so sad and dry,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>like a watermelon plant that hasn’t been watered. Had his time come? After
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>how many humiliated women?
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>And I never imagined that I would play this part in the life of a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>man, and then I saw Angel sitting on the bench at the back next to the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>door, and I saw an expression of admiration and love that took my heart to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>my throat and my stomach to my feet, and I felt myself blush so hot that
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>think even with my dark skin the judge noticed and cleared his throat and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>thanked me for my testimony.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>And in the end, not even the velvet of the devil in Eddie’s words
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>did him any good. They found him guilty. And afterwards Angel took my
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>hand, looked at me with those eyes of thick honey, and there, right in the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Hall of Justice of a little town in Wyoming, even knowing that soon I would
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>be deported out of the country, he asked me to marry him.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>When a great happiness mixes with a great sadness, it’s something
				<lb facs='#facs_33_tr_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to put the fear of God in you, Consuelo, but a hot fear that melts into

				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>jurado sobre el Milagro del Almuerzo Arrojado, que me
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pude escapar de Eddie cuando vomité encima de él, yo les
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>vi unas sonrisitas, hasta el juez tuvo que taparse la boca
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>para que no lo vieran reirse. Pero cuando les conté sobre
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>mi bisabuela Maclovia de las Manos de Manjar quien me
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>había enseñado el arte de sobar, los vi muy interesados,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>algunos comenzaron a sobarse el cuello, otros a mover la
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cabeza de un lado a otro, todos sus cuerpos parecían
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>estar moviéndose, pidiéndole ayuda a mis manos.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Y me acordé de una vez que mi bisabuela
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Maclovia me dijo, “Corazoncito, el cuerpo no
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>miente, las palabras pueden ser como terciopelo del
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>diablo, pero el cuerpo dice la verdad,” y me pre
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>gunté si el juez sabía leer a los cuerpos o si se deja
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ba engañar por las palabras y en eso miré a Eddie,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>el acusado, y me dio pena, se veía triste y seco,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>como una mata de sandía sin regar. «Le había lle
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>gado su hora, después de cuántas mujeres
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>humilladas?
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Y yo nunca me hubiera imaginado que
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>yo jugaría este papel en la vida de un hombre,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>y en eso vi a Angel sentado en el banco de atrás
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>junto a la puerta y le vi una expresión de admiración y amor que me
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>llevó el corazón a la garganta y el estómago a los pies y me sentí sonrojar tan caliente que
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>creo que hasta con mi piel morena el juez se dio cuenta y se aclaró la garganta y me agradeció
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>por mi testimonio.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Y al final, aún el terciopelo del diablo en sus palabras no le hizo nada bien a Eddie, lo
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>encontraron culpable, y después Angel me tomó de la mano, me miró con esos ojos de miel
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>espesa y allí, en la mera Sala de Justicia de un pueblito en Wyoming, aún sabiendo que den
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tro de poco me deportarían fuera del país, me pidió que me casara con él.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_tr_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Cuando una gran felicidad se mezcla con una gran tristeza es algo que da miedo,

				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dear Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>At last I was able to get together with Dr. Goodman. (l told her
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her name should be Goodwoman.) She is very interested in the massage
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>healing system that my great-grandmother Maclovia of the Hands of
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Heaven taught me, and she also told me that she was very grateful for and
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>impressed by the courage I showed in offering myself as a witness in the
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>trial and risking my residency in this country. Now she is helping me get
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>my papers, and next week I will start working in her clinic.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>All in all, from tripe to heart, I never imagined that everything
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>would turn out so well. John (Angel’s boss who did business with Eddie)
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>came to apologize for trying to blackmail me with Angel’s papers, and he and
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Laura are going to a counselor together to try and save their marriage. It
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>turns out that Eddie was only one of the owners of the chain of stores
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that offers John’s products, and the other owners want to continue buying
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>from John. Eddie will serve five years in prison for the crime of rape.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Jandro is so happy because he caught his first trout. He and
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Angel go fishing together, and Angel now calls him Trucha. I have never
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>seen a grin like the one that he makes when Angel says to him, “Hey,
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Trucha”; he puffs up like a globe of light, smiles coming out even from his
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>pockets.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>1have told Angel that I want to receive my green card before we
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>get married, because that way everyone will know that I am marrying for
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>love and not for papers.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>feel strong like an alamo and new like the spring, happy as ifl
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>had been invited to the quinceañera parties of all the saints. In my heart
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>there is a stampede of horses in love, galloping toward the sea, toward
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the mountain, and toward heaven all at once, with a million wings making
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>free and deep music so that we may dance in community and love on this
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>earth, complete men and complete women sharing the fruits of time.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_tr_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Your friend always,

				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Estimada Consuelo,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Por fin me pude juntar en persona con la Doctora Goodman. (Yo le dije que su
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>nombre debería ser Goodwoman.) Ella está muy interesada en el sistema de sobar que
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>me enseñó mi bisabuela Maclovia de las Manos de Manjar y también me dijo que estaba
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>muy agradecida e impresionada por el valor que mostré al ofrecerme como testigo en el
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>juicio y arriesgar mi residencia en este país. Ahora ella me está ayudando a conseguir mis
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>papeles y la próxima semana comenzaré a trabajar en su clínica.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Al hacer de tripas corazón, nunca me imaginé que todo saldría tan bien. John
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>(quien emplea a Angel y hacía negocios con Eddie) me vino a pedir perdón por tratar
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>de chantajearme con la documentación de Angel y él y Laura están yendo a terapia jun-
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tos para tratar de salvar su matrimonio. Resulta que Eddie era solo uno de los dueños
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>de la cadena de tiendas que ofrece los productos de John y los otros dueños han queri
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>do seguir comprándole a John. Eddie servirá cinco años en prisión por el crimen de
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>violación.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Jandro está contentísimo porque pescó su primer pescado. El y Angel se van de
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>pesca juntos y Angel ahora lo llama “Trucha.” Nunca he visto una
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sonrisa como la que le sale cuando Angel le dice, “Hey, Trucha,” se
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>infla como un globo de luz y le salen sonrisas hasta de los bolsillos.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Yo le he dicho a Angel que quiero conseguir mi tarjeta
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>verde antes de casarme con él, porque así todos sabrán que
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>me caso por amor y no por papeles.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Me siento fuerte como un álamo y nueva como la
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>primavera, alegre como si me hubieran invitado a las
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fiestas quinceañeras de todas las santas. En mi corazón
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>hay una estampida de caballos enamorados cabalgan
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>do hacia el mar, hacia el monte y hacia el cielo a la

				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>y profunda para que bailemos en comunidad y
				<lb facs='#facs_37_tr_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>amor en esta tierra, hombres completos y

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Performance art in the west did not begin with
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Dadaist events. Since the early days of the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Conquest, “aboriginal samples” of people from
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Africa, Asia, and the Americas were brought to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Europe for aesthetic contemplation, scientific
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>analysis, and entertainment. Those people were
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>forced first to take the place that Europeans had
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>already created for the savages of their own
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>medieval mythology; later, with the emergence of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>scientific rationalism, the human specimens on
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>display served as proof of the natural superiority of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>European civilization, of its ability to exert control
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>over and extract knowledge from the so-called
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>primitive world, and ultimately of the genetic infe
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>riority of non-European races.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Over the last five hundred years nonwestern
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>human beings have been exhibited in the taverns,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>theatres, gardens, museums, zoos, circuses, and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>world fairs of Europe and the freak shows of the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>United States. The first impresario of this sort was
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Columbus, who brought several Arawaks to the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Spanish court and left one on display for two years.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Among the most famous cases were many women:
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Pocahantas was taken to England to promote
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Virginia tobacco; Saartje Benjamin, popularly
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>known as the Hottentot Venus, was thought to
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>embody bestial sexuality because of her large
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>buttocks; and the Mexican bearded woman Julia
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Pastrana continues to be displayed in embalmed
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>form to this day While the quincentenary celebra

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Americas, it was actually these human exhibitions
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that enabled most Caucasians to “discover” the “other.”
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>In most cases, the persons who were exhibited
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>did not choose to be put on display. More benign
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>versions continue to take place today in festivals
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and amusement parks with the partial consent of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the “primitives.” Contemporary tourist industries
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and the cultural ministries of various countries still
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>perpetrate the illusion of authenticity to cater to

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the western fascination with otherness. So do
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N002'/>many artists.
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N003'/>In commemoration of five hundred years of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N004'/>practices that inform contemporary multicultural
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N005'/>ism in the west, I undertook a series of site-specific
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N006'/>performances with Guillermo Gómez-Peña over the
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N007'/>course of 1992. We lived in a gilded cage for three
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N008'/>days in Columbus Plaza in Madrid, Covent Garden
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N009'/>in London, the Smithsonian Institution, the Field
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N010'/>Museum in Chicago, and the Australian Museum of
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N011'/>Natural History in Sydney. In each case, we pre
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N012'/>sented ourselves as aboriginal inhabitants of an
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N013'/>island in the Gulf of Mexico that had been over
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N014'/>looked by Columbus. We performed authentic and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N015'/>traditional tasks, such as writing on a laptop com
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N016'/>puter, watching television, sewing voodoo dolls, and
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N017'/>doing exercises. Interested audience members paid
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N018'/>for authentic dances, stories, and polaroids of us
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N019'/>posing with them.

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>1992 was a year of rediscovery for me as for all
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the peoples of the Americas. When I went to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Mexico in the fall to perform Regression 500, I
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>learned that to declare yourself Mexican in Mexico
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>is now a political statement. In fact, it’s easier to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>deal with the imposed “othering” of U.S. culture
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>than with the condescending attitudes of your
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>“own” people. The art world in Mexico is so hung
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>up with being “international” (as in “free trade”
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that it brands artists like me who live in the U.S.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and deal with the complexities of Mexican identit
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>as “Chicanizers.” Fortunately, when the gallery fails,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the streets come to the rescue. On October 12.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>1992, I did a performance as part of a demonstra
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tion by indigenous groups at the Arbol de la Noche
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Triste, where Cortes is said to have wept after his
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>single defeat by the Aztecs. We corrected official
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>history by renaming this tree the Arbol de la Victoria.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>My work as both visual and performance artist
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>unfolds on two distinct levels: the gallery/theatrical
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>space and the street. On the one hand, I collabo
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>rate with writers, musicians, stage directors, etc.,
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>on multimedia pieces that collage mythopoetic
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>scripts with visual elements (costumes, slide/video
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>projections, installations). On the other, I enter the
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>public space of the street to express a direct
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>response to urgent social and political issues. I seek
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to open myself to my immediate environment, to
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>transform art into life and vice versa, and most
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>important, to involve four simultaneous planes in
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>this process: the physical, the mental, the emotion
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>al, and the spiritual. Politics and metaphysics, as far
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>as I am concerned, are not mutually exclusive.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>In the future I want to use my work to go more
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>deeply into forgotten or ignored traditions, includ

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N001'/>Since the early 1980s I have been working with
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N002'/>improvisation in what I call energetic work. Based

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N006'/>go-go dancer, l’ve developed a series of evolving
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N007'/>structures or improvisational modes to access a per
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N008'/>sonal movement language and approach that bypasses

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N011'/>in New York. The celebration of sensuality and pleasure
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N012'/>is a strong component of this work.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N013'/>Improvisation demands a total use of the dancer’s
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N014'/>sensory, mental, physical, and emotional capacities
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N015'/>- all of which are a result of her history (cultural,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N016'/>temporal, physical, emotional, spiritual, etc.). It
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N017'/>demands total presence, senses open -
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N018'/>listening,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N019'/>watching, observing; molding, conjuring, directing,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N020'/>following energetic/electrical/emotional impulses. The

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>open receptivity which I equate with sensuality-
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the opening-up of the pelvis, or indeed any part of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the body, to allow energy/emotions/thought/sensa-
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tions to flow through.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I have addressed these issues directly in my
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dances since 1989. Tú y Yo is a simple choreographic
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>structure that is in essence a strip act. The dancer
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>presents herself to the audience, revealing herself
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>through the successive removal of layers of clothing,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>all the while directly confronting the audience and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dancing in response to her perception of the audience’s
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>reactions and her own feelings.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>In Broken Hearts I created a mode where we gen
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tly follow and sense the movement initiated in the

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>There is an emphasis on placing the pelvis deliber

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>body to settle softly onto it. The women’s section
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>works with this settling as solo material and incor
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>porates elements recognizable in go-go dancing:
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>crawling while looking over the shoulders, sitting
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>positions in which the legs and hips and open, eye
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>contact with the audience, swaying the hips. In one
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>section we use magnifying glasses to “reveal” parts
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of our semi-naked bodies to the audience.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>In the duet for James Adlesic and Evelyn Vélez
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the placing of the pelvis on the floor evolves to
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>placing the pelvis on the other’s pelvis, increasing
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in pace as the dancers move from lying to standing.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The effect of two bodies scrambling to settle their
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>pelvises on each other’s is a highly erotic duet in

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Sacude is a work in salsa and shake modes. While
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>dancing a rumba, the dancer allows the impetus of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>shaking to move from the pelvis and torso through
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the rest of the body. The shaking is explosive, con
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>stantly renewing itself. The dancer rides the speed and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>momentum like a surfer riding a wave. The moment
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>she reaches a place of exhaustion, the shaking estab
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lishes itself again, rising from unexpected places. It
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>is exhilarating for the dancer (and the audience): a
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>celebration of the pleasure and power of our bodies.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>I find it interesting that only once has a critic

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Latino culture. These issues help explain how the

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ginalized cultures, was in some ways postmodern
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>before the First World, a pre-postmodernity so to speak.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The first issue is the ability to simultaneously han
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>dle multiple codes. Accustomed to dealing with the
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>arbitrary imposition of foreign products and practices,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>this culture has learned the tactics of selection and

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>for adaptation allows Latin American culture to select

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her for a while. I would tell her that she could be

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as well as in writing, that I was a “Hispanic” and, there
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fore, they had the right to count me as a “minority.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>This was indeed a surreal and upsetting experience,

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ance with the law. It was also absurd and even funny in

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>me as l began to search for critiques of the “Hispanic”

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>considered that the problems inherent in the label
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>were obvious, but I was wrong: I found only a hand
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ful of articles which, critical of the “Hispanic” label,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>suggested that “Latino” was more historically and

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>erations, and which, objectively, is socially rejected,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>economically excluded, and lacks political power. The
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>invention of the “Hispanic” label erases the difference
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>between the historically oppressed populations of

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>these populations. For example, to throw together

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the first thing to catch one&apos;s attention is that the labels
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>hide more than they reveal. For instance, they hide the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>fact that a large proportion of these populations are of
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Native American and European descent. The labels
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>perform neat tricks; they minoritize foreigners from
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Spanish-speaking countries (many of whom are of

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>or national origin. While that might seem good, the

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and oppressed for generations are far from desirable.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I cannot end without restating some of my personal
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>views on these matters. This issue of Heresies was
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>initially called “jViva Latina!” What I have written
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would seem to indicate my rejection of the “Latina”
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>label. That would be a correct inference. It makes
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sense to me to consider myself, besides Argentine,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Latin American. The labels “Latina/Latino” are, from
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>my standpoint, adaptations to U.S.-imposed condi
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tions of political discourse which disable rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>enable the populations so labeled. Why? Because, in

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Recently I was asked by a corporate marketing representative to

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Brincando el charco (“Crossing the Creek”) is a 57-minute experimental narrative on contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Puerto Rican identities. The film mixes fiction, archival footage, current demonstration images,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>processed interviews, music video, and soap opera conventions to weave the story of Claudia Marín,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a middle-class, light-skinned Puerto Rican lesbian and photographer attempting to construct com
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>munity in the U.S. In the process of confronting the simultaneity of privilege and oppression that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>structures her position, the film becomes a meditation on class, race, and sexuality as shifting differ

				<lb facs='#facs_98_region_1701379459196_67_tl_19' n='N019'/>The first incident revolved around an examination for “bright students,” who at that time were in

				<lb facs='#facs_98_region_1701379459196_67_tl_22' n='N022'/>where the students were primarily African American and Puerto Rican. PS. 168 was located at 104

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>body. I was also a founder of The Association of Hispanic Arts (though I disagreed with the use of

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>was raised a Mennonite, which gave me

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>became involved in art in the early 1970s as a way to protect my

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>in Argentina at that time. My artwork is a personal exploration into

				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her own babies.” Invariably effective, the ominous threat of

				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>innocence I could think of us only as very easy prey, for surely,

				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>bothered to save us.
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Other versions of the always evolving legend were at hand
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>as we grew up and struggled for independence and self-identi-
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ty. Of course, as adolescents we no longer believed Mamá’s
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>&quot;“superstitious crap,” as we became aware of what I now call,

				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>kid control and self-preservation. Yet those grown-up versions
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of La Llorona stay with me today as vividly as the others. One
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tawdry form tells of a teenage girl who, disobeying her par
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ents, sneaks away to a dance, is seduced by a handsome
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>stranger, and becomes pregnant. Aghast at her condition, she
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>conceals it until the child is born; then in fright and shame she
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>drowns her baby, runs away, and is doomed to the eternal,
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tearful Llorona search. Another variation has as its antihero a
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>young, pretty, and very lonely mother whose husband is sta
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>tioned in Korea. Succumbing to temptation, she leaves her
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>children untended to indulge in a night on the town. When
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>she returns, the children have disappeared. Ashamed to face
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her family and husband, she spends the rest of her life crying
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and searching for her kidnapped and/or murdered babies.
				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>As an adult I have often exchanged Llorona tales with

				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N003'/>in love with her. Although social mores prevent their marrying,

				<lb facs='#facs_130_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N008'/>children in a well and then commits suicide. When her soul
