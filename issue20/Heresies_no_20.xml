				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Heresies is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of art and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that whot
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>is commonly called art can have a political impact and that in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>making of art and all cultural artifacts our identities as women play
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a distinct role. We hope that Heresies will stimulate dialogue around
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>radical political and aesthefic theory, as well as generate new
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>creative energies among women. It will be a place where diversity
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>can be articulated. We are committed to broadening the definition
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Heresies is published by a collective of feminists, some ofwhom
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>are also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists; our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>performance, art history, architecture, filmmaking, photography,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and video. While the themes of the individval issues will be deter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>mined by the collective, each issue will have a different editorial
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>statf, composed ot women who want to work on that issue as well
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as members of the collective. Heresies provides experience for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>women who work editorially, in design, and in production. An open
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>evaluation meeting will be held after the appearance of each issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Heresies will try to be accountable to and in touch with the inter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>national feminist community.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>As women, we are aware fhat historically fhe connections be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fween our lives, our arts, and our ideas have been suppressed.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Once these connections are clarified, they can function as a means
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>understand the relationship between art and politics, work and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>workers. As a step toward the demystification of art, we reject the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>standard relationship ot crificism to art within the present system,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because they
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>are made by women. We are not committed to any parficular style
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>or aesthetic, nor to the compefitive mentality that pervades the art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>feel that in the process of fhis dialogue we can foster a change in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the meaning of art.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>issues, slowly turning into a tangleo
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>knot. And we members of the collective,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>like all activists, swung from enthus
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>iasm to perseverance to frustration
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and back.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The original premise sounded simple
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>—the issue was to be the story ot womer

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>peace movement. We then ran headlong
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>into the problem encountered by most
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>organizers of demonstrations, and many

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>But if you focus and make things cleai

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>That knot was loosened by following
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the line that most strongly affected us. In
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>reading the work submitted, we found
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that we were impressed by the lives of

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>From the day I was born, my personal life has been inextricably
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>connected with politics. I was born in Tule Lake Japanese Intern
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ment Camp in California where my mother and father had gone to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>work after my father declared himself to be a conscientious objec
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tor. He worked as an organizer in the camp; my mother taught. We
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>lived there until I was close to two. After that, until the late 1950’s,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>my father organized farmers throughout the United States, from
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>California to Vermont. I would be hauled along from one farmhouse
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to another for meetings. I would be put to bed in the parlor off the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>kitchen and lulled to sleep by discussions of farm issues.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Almost all the memories of my formative years are set against
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>this background of politics. Because of this I had almost no con
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>cept of being political or not political. In fact, in the sixties and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>seventies when everyone was having intense talks about being
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>political, I felt as though I wasn’t. I suppose because it was so
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>deeply ingrained, I couldn’t separate enough to see it. It wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>until much later, quite recently in fact, when my friends were re
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>treating from politics that I saw that my commitment was still there
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and that indeed l’d always been a poltical person. Even in the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>earliest childhood pieces, politics was present. In terms of beinç
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>active, in my mind I guess being a person and being politically
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>active are one and the same thing. In a way there was almost no
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>choice involved for me, except to figure out where to put my energy.

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The sign read PINKO DYKES GO HOME. I slowed my car to look at  it that last Sunday in July. It was hot and sunny,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>hot enough to feel like it had to rain soon, and the humidity was gathering thunder clouds on the western horizon
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>over the lake. The men and women standing by the sign looked angry and defiant and hot and a little embor
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>rassed. The men wore t-shirts or shortsleeved sportshits and jeans or khakis The women hod on blouses and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>bermuda shorts or slacks. They held flags, small ones. They didn&apos;t hold them easily. lt&apos;s hard to cross your
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>arms defiantly over your chest and still hold a flag, but some of hem managed.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>A year of planning had gone into the demonstration against the installation of Cruise and Pershing
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>missiles at Seneca&apos;s army depot. There were months of out reach to the local upstate New York
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>community about issues of disarmament and economics, about conversion from miltary employ
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ment to non military. There had been a recent history of women-only peace actions in countries all
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>over the world. Still the sign reod PINKO DYKES GO HOME.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I wondered what would happen if I stopped the car and got out and went over and introduced
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>myself as a Pinko Dyke. But I didn&apos;t do it. For ten years now hove lived in rural northeastern
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>farming communities. For two years l was on assistant Girl Scout leader in a village the size
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of this one. Our troup went on hay rides and climbed mountains and sold cookies with the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>help of mothers and fathers who dressed and looked and felt much like these citizens. But
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in my own community, l am still on outsider. Although l hove built my home there, I have
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>never been at home there, never been open about my sexuality, have depended on
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the almost inevitable separation of village and city for my anonymity, speaking as a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>lesbian in an event in the city, keeping that identity discreetly pocketed at Girl Scout
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>events in my village. So when I looked at the Pinko Dyke sign, I felt like I was seeing my
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>friends and neighbors standing behind it. When l turned my head and looked across
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the road at the base, was looking at my other home, the home of my childhood.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I was a war baby, born at Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. My father was
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>away for most of my infancy. Meeting him when he returned in 1946 is one of my
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>earliest memories, a memory l share with many of my generation. For several years
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>we lived in Indianapolis where my father worked as a meatpacker for Armour and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Company. Why he went back into the military in 1950 was never discussed in my
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>family, but I assume he was attracted by the class mobility the miltary seemed to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>provide. During wartime, he had been promoted from private to major. When he
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>re-enlisted, he was sent to Officer&apos;s Training School in Alexandria, Louisiana. I remem
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ber because I was seven and learned to swim with water wings in the pool at the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Officer&apos;s Club there. I swam in the ocean for the first tine off Cape Cod when we were
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>stationed at Otis Air Force Base. A tomboy girlfriend taught me to spit accurately at a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>target twelve feet away in the family barracks at the Armed Forces Staff College in
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Norfolk, Virginia, and another taught me to play &quot;splits&quot; with a jack knife on the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>manicured lawns of Langley Air Force Base. I learned to ride a horse western style on
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the flight line of Tinker Air Base in Oklahoma, graduated from Gen. H.H. Arnold High
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>School in Wiesbaden, Germany, and went home from college for my first Christmas to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Griffiss Ar Force Base in Rome, New York, only a few miles from the Seneca Army
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Depot I was driving by. So the Army Depot looked like home to me and the people
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>who stood on the other side of the fence looked like friends and family How did I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>come so far from being a part of that community, l have wondered. What were he
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>assumptions of that life and how must they have changed if I was standing here and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>those people were standing over there?
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>I was raised in on orderly military life, a life that felt safe and protected. Today that
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>sounds like a contradiction. Then, the military meant safety to me, and predictability. I
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>may have lived on some of the most active—in fact, vulnerable—Strategic Air Com
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>mand bases in this country. But to me, a scramble was something all dads did in the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>course of a work day. It was one of the rituals, like the ritual observed every day of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>my childhood of 5 p.m. when the loud speakers sounded taps and the flag was low
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ered. No matter what base I was on, what country I was in, cars stopped, men, women
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and children stopped walking and faced west. Men in uniform saluted. The rest of us
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>stood self-consciously with our hands on our hearts. It was a pause in the day ob

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>served by every member of the community. In my memory, it was always sunset.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>That life was contained. We lived within walls, within fences and gates and barbed wires. Sometimes we lived
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>within language and culture barriers--a contained life. I moved twenty-one times before  left home to go to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>college. As children, my sisters and I each had a toy box. What it could contain went with us to the new base. I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>don&apos;t remember what happened to the toys that didn&apos;t into the box--the uncontainable. But there was a
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>certain comfort in knowing exactly what I possessed and where I could find it.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>When I was growing up, the military community was homogeneous, like the rural farm community I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>live in now. I never had a childhood friend of a different race. A few were Catholic, but we all
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>attended the some military chapel. I never met a Jew, or knew had, until went to college. Many
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of my peers lived in Germany or England or ltaly for two or three years and never met a European
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>person, never learned a word of the language, never stepped off the base and into a foreign
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>culture. That life was contained, predictable, and safe.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>So l sat in the car with the engine idling and decided not to walk over and talk with the men
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and women standing by the Pinko Dyke Go Home sign. I don&apos;t look like them anymore. I
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>don&apos;t cut my hair or contain it. I laugh too loud. I make love with the wrong sex. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>wearing a lavender t shirt with a Peace Encampment symbol on the front and the word
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Sappho on the back. But inside, the me that wasn&apos;t visible to them, the me I sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>forget about was struggling to say to them, &quot;Hey, I&apos;m one of you. I&apos;m o.k. Don&apos;t hurt
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>me. I belong here too.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The day before, in the village of Waterloo, wearing my Sappho t-shirt, I had walked
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>straight into their anger. I had expected that everyone would behave well; I had
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>believed that we might be having a difference of opinion here, but they would in the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>end see that we were reasonable and nice, enough like them that the waters would
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>part and we would be allowed to pass. I was wrong. What they said and did told us
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that we did not look familiar to them at all. In fact, it told us we looked so unfamiliar
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>we ought to be killed. One man carried a sign that read, NUKE &apos;EM TILL THEY
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>GLOW, THEN SHOOT THEM IN THE DARK. It became a slogan, shouted over and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>over, along with &apos;Lezzie go home,&apos; &apos;Commie go home,&apos; and racist epithets shouted at
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>an Asian woman who walked with us.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>We had walked through Seneca Falls to the Peace Encampment. As we passed
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the new National Park Office for the Women&apos;s Hall of Fame, past the corner where
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the first Women&apos;s Rights Convention had been held, past some of the homes where
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the women lived who gathered to have tea and discuss political strategy and draft
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the Seneca Falls Bill of Rights. About one hundred of us walked past Saturday morn
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ing shoppers and a few people who came out of their homes to see what we were
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>up to, past drivers who stopped to take our leaflets and those who accelerated and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>called us crazy, past the town line of Seneca Falls and into the village of Waterloo,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>birthplace—a sign proclaims—of Memorial Day. As we walked, the crowds on the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>street grew larger. Many were waving flags. We began to get reports that the Ameri
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>can Legion was planning a counter demonstration on a bridge the other side of the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>village and, as we approached, the hostility in the air increased. Cars went by and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>people screamed at us out of the windows. Two well-dressed women on the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>streetcorner told me I was an asshole as I tried to give them a flyer explaining the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>purpose of the walk.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The crowd closed in behind us on the narrow bridge. I can remember clearly the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>violence and hysterical anger in the hot July air, and I could see that many of the men
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>were drinking, that some of them were armed. When the village sheriff told us we
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>were on our own, he had no intention of escorting us through the mob, some women
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>behind me began to sit in a circle while a few of us stood around them, our clasped

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>play of affection that was probably not common in Waterloo.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Still, under different, less stressful circumstances, it might not
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>have been perceived as obscene in Waterloo.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Contained, Predictable, Safe--that was the life she wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>for her daughter. What she saw in women at the Peace En
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>campment was, I believe, an energy that was not contained or
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>predictable. I was (and is) the energy of self-empowered women
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and, like most positive energy, it is--at its source--erotic. &quot;There
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>are many kinds of power,&quot; Audre Lorde reminds us in the The Uses
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of the Erotic.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The erotic is a resource within each of us that lies in a deeply
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>female and spiritual plane, firmly rooted in the power of our

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>unexpressed or unrecognized feeling. In order to perpetuate
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>itself, every oppression must corrupt or distort those various
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sources of power within the culture of the oppressed that can
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>provide energy for change.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Therefore, as women living under patriarchy, we are taught
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to separate this erotic energy from every part of our lives except
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the specifically sexual, and we are taught to contain the sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>part of our lives to heterosexuality to one man, to a few child
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>bearing years, to specific and limited and allowable expres
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>sions. To go outside those limits is to be branded--whore,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>nymphomaniac, lesbian are the most usual brands.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Because the Peace Encampment did not admit men, that en
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ergy was seen as lesbian. Much of that energy was lesbian.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Lesbians were active at all levels of planning and carrying out
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>this event. So were heterosexual and bisexual women. At the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Encampment itself we talked about these differences: what it
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>meant for all of us to be working together, how a straight
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>woman felt when a hostile heckler called her a lesbian, how
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>lesbians felt about the need to continually defend the reasons
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for a &quot;woman-only&quot; action. There was pain and growth in those
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>dialogues.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>One vignette in particular recurs to me whenever I consider
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>this issue, however. On the morning of the August 1st demon
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>stration, two of us were wondering together how many of the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women at the Encampment were lesbians. My friend was in her
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sixties and had been a lesbian all of her adult life. &quot;I can&apos;t tell,&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>she said with some chagrin. &quot;You know, I always used to be
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>able to tell, but can&apos;t any more.&quot; We decided—on the basis
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>perhaps of nothing but wishful thinking--that probably 50 to 75
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>percent of the women there that day were lesbian, and the sub
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ject disappeared until later in the afternoon.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>After hours of standing in the heat waiting for the sheriff to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>allow the march to proceed, we finally approached the Depot
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>gates where the civil disobedience was toking place. Across
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>from the Depot was a small chapel where a woman had set up
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a microphone and speakers, and, as the demonstrators filed in
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>front of her, she sang revival hymns and invited them to leave
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>their wicked ways and find true peace with Jesus. My affinity
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>group had been assigned to the rear of the march where a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>group of about fifty men who supported the action were walk-
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ing, local men—farmers, business men and teachers. As we
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>approached the chapel, the gospel singer began to take down
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>her microphone, her work finished when she saw the men at
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the end of the march. &quot;My God,&quot; her voice boomed across the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>lawn, &quot;They&apos;ve even got some men with them.&quot; Then she came
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>back to the microphone. &quot;Shame on you,&quot; she called to the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>men, &quot;shame on you. Go back to your wives. Aren&apos;t you ashamed
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to be seen walking with lesbians.&quot; I was too stunned to respond,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>but the minister walking next to me called out, &quot;I&apos;m proud to be
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>walking with lesbians.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>It was quiet for a moment and then I called to the friend walk
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ing ahead of me, &quot;Hey do you remember that question I asked
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>you this morning?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied without hesitation. &quot;That
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>woman thinks the answer is 100 percent.&quot; The whole rear of the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>march started to laugh because everyone knew what the ques
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>tion must have been and several admitted to me later they had
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>been wondering the some thing themselves. The answer, in fact,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>doesn&apos;t matter. The perception does matter—one hundred
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>percent.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>To come to the Peace Encampment was, for most women, an
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>act of self-empowerment. It was an act that said, &quot;I am capable
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of judging the terrible destructive power of these weapons and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>choose to say no to their use, their existence.&quot; It was an act that
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>recognized the power of women bonding together, recognized
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>that ancient and healing power. It was an act that, at one level,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>excluded men, but at another level it encouraged men to make
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>their own action or give support to this action that women had
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>chosen. Some men did one or both, leaving behind in their deci
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>sion to do so the inherent power they control under patriarchy.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Men did childcare and carried water at the demonstration and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ran the shuttle bus between the State Park and the Encampment
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>while women went to meetings and planned actions and made
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>political choices and policy decisions. As these women tried to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>create a world they wanted to live in with their children and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>lovers and friends, they felt empowered. To the citizens of Wa

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>terloo and the citizens of the larger world reached by national
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>media, that empowerment was seen as lesbian and it was seen
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>as threatening, so threatening that at times those citizens wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to destroy it—and us.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Our response to that perception, to that accusation, is
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the key. We must not deny the lesbian label. The pain and the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>struggle thot such labeling brings with it is, in fact, a gift which
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>marks change so profound, so life-enhancing, that it feels
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>life-threatening.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>What l have learned about myself in recent years—and I think
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I am like my neighbors and the angry citizens of Waterloo and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>some of the women who come to the Peace Encampment and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>left disaffected and angry because it was not what they expected
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>—what I hove learned is that I do not suffer change gladly. I
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>don&apos;t mean the surface changes. I can move from place to place
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and that seems like change, but as long as I can bring my box
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>with me, containing the familiar things in life, then I&apos;m not in
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>trouble. l think that when the people who work at the Seneca
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Army Depot are confronted with women who want a specific
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>missile out, that is a surface change. When we talk about want
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing to convert the Depot to other forms of production, that is
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>more basic. But neither is as basic to the way Americans live
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>our lives as our assumptions about family and social relation
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ships and responsibilities. However painful the change, those
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>assumptions must change if we are to survive.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>That day at Waterloo, standing facing the angry, shouting
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>crowd, I began to talk with three young women, teenagers, who
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>did not seem so angry. They felt safe. They were out for a little
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>adventure. When it went on longer than they expected, one had
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to run home and put her sour cream and onion dip back into
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the refrigerator. They wanted to know was I on welfare and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>who was toking care of my children? When told them l was a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>teacher and a Girl Scout leader but had no children of my own,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>they seemed surprised, interested enough to keep talking to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Finally one screwed her courage up for the BIG question. &quot;Are
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>you gay?&quot; she asked. &quot;Yes,&quot; I answered and they stepped back,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>physically withdrew a few steps. &quot;Does it matter?&quot; I asked. &quot;Oh,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>not to me...&quot; she insisted bravely, &quot;but...&quot; and she gestured
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>over to where her brother was shouting at some of the other
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>women peace marchers. She seemed confused. &quot;How can you?
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>But you said.. What about?&quot; ..she stood staring at me trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>understand where I fit into what she had heard about lesbians.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Later in that long afternoon one of the same young women
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>asked me, &quot;Are you scared?&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; I said, my voice letting
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>her know it was true. &quot;Aren&apos;t you?&quot; She said no, at first, looking
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>again toward her brother. I knew she was thinking he was there
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to protect her, that I was the one of us at risk. Then she hesi
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>tated. Well, maybe she was a little scared, she admitted.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>I don&apos;t know if she could see the hand weapons bulging out
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>of pockets. She knew, as I did, that a man had been arrested
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>when he dashed into the crowd waving a loaded rifle earlier
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>that afternoon. She had not heard the sheriff when l asked him
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>if he knew some of the men in the crowd were armed and was
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>he dealing with that potentiol problem? &quot;This is America,&quot; he
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>snarled at me, &quot;citizens hove a right to bear arms.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>But I don&apos;t think that was what her fear was about. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>afraid of me, and she was afraid of what she was learning. I
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>don&apos;t ever want to apologize for being the source of that fear.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>When we—any of us—have that urge to apologize for causing
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>doubt and fear and pain and anger by being who we are and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>speaking for what we believe in, then I think we need to step
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>back and look at the expectations we are bringing to the event,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>peel back the layers of our own &quot;shoulds&quot; and &quot;ought-tos&quot;.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>When I do that for myself, I realize several things. In the past, I

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I have described myself as working best within a clearly defined

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to whom I give orders. I was very early patterning and, for the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>eldest of three sisters, very relevant. I have also said to myself
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that I learn most readily when I am not threatened, when I am
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>comfortable.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>But, in my honest moments, I know that I do my best work in a

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>They were a family of seven living in two cramped rooms,

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>There wasn’t anything else to do. I rolled up my sleeves and

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>buckets of water. First the newborn baby was washed and clothed

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>don’t trust non-activists, particularly those who have several oppressed

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>other people to make the quality of their lives better. Not everybody
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>needs to “sacrifice” themselves and every other desire they have in
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>life to work in the movement. In fact no one should sacrifice them

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_20_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The impetus for the Train-ed Poets project began in the fall of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_20_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>1982 when Mi Nombre worked as a receptionist for an all

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lives to which brand of soda or hand cream to buy.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Surrounded daily by language used to exploit and
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>deceive, Mi Nombre wanted to create an alternative. Influenced
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>by the graffiti artists of New York City, she would use the trains
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and buses as her medium.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Mi Nombre shared the idea with other members of her writ
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing group—Erin Green, Lucinda, and wwolf.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Together, we further developed the concept. We wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>be read by all the people who might never enter a bookstore
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>—working-class people who are not encouraged to read po
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>etry, or to read—or to think (and who are denied crucial sources
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of learning and power). And so we broke from the traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>form of the book—a form that has become unapproachable to
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>so many people.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Within two months, we wrote over seventy poems specifically
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>for the Train-ed Poets project. During the next year, the Train-ed
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Poets filed copyrights, sought legal advice, received guidance
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>from consulting artist Manuel Gómez-Rosa on the use of dry

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>da), found affordable printing services, and obtained a post
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>office box.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The final step—actually posting the poems on the subway
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>—was met with a mixture of fear, apprehension, and excite
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ment: Posting poems is not legal. Like many activists ot the past
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and present, we risk arrest for the most dangerous of activities
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>—encouraging people to read, fhink, and question.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>For Erin Green and Lucinda, posting the poems is the most
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>thrilling part of the project. Embracing adventure the way they
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>do, the illegality of the project makes it all the more appealing.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;However, says Lucinda, &quot;realities like the murder of Michael
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Stewart frighten us deeply, and even more horritying is the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that the killers were set free. But thats precisely why we’re out
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>here doing this.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>The first year of posting was hardest for Mi Nombre. Getting
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>on the subway late at night, somefimes alone, having fo be equally
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>on guard against muggers and the police, meant contronting
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>some very real dangers. By challenging and, at the same time,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_22_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>respecting her fear, Mi Nombre makes posting a way of assert

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>But today l want to talk to Gloria about
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>South Africa because she is the founder of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>what l think is a very important organization,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>which will become increasingly so as the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>situation in South Africa continues to build.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>That organization is SISA, which is Sisters in
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>Support of Sisters in South Africa. SISA also
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>means mercy in African dialects.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>There are a lot of things that we should
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>talk about, but first could you tell us about
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>SISA, how you began to think about this
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>organization and how you started it and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>what you hope it will do.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>G.J.-Well, briefly, in terms of SISA’s origin
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>and history: In November 1984, while
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>was working at Hampshire College, there
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>was an event sponsored by the teminist
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>studies group that was titled &quot;A Pure
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>Pleasure Luncheon.&quot; I felt that at this time
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>in history, women’s groups, parficularly
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>on a college campus, should be giving
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>some concern to the polifical aspects of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>women on a global basis. That&apos;s not to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>say that l’m against pleasure or lunch
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>eons, but l just felt that at this particular
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>time we should take advantage ot the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>opportunity of having groups ot women
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>together to put forth at least one single
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>phase of a political aspect of women. So
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>therefore I decided not to attend this
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;pure pleasure&quot; luncheon but instead to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>urge the women to make a financial
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>donation to send to fhe oppressed peo
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ples of South Africa.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Now, let me also say that, prior to this,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Thad become familiar with Ellen Kuzwayo,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>who is a 71-year-old South African
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>woman and activist, and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N018'/>author of a book, Call Me
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N019'/>Woman. I met her in the film
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N020'/>&quot;Awake from Mourning.&quot; That
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N021'/>film was made in South Africa
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N022'/>and was concerned with wom
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N023'/>en&apos;s self-help
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N024'/>groups that
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N025'/>formed andbe
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N026'/>gan to become

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N029'/>ing in Soweto.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>So, decided ot
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the &quot;pure plea
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sure&quot; luncheon
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that the faculty,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>statt and students should make a dona
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tion to an Ellen Kuzwayo fund for op
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>pressed peoples. Itook an empty cotfee
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>can, wrapped a piece of paper around
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>it, and wrote &quot;The Ellen Kuzwayo Fund
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for Oppressed Peoples&quot;. And that is how
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>it began.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Well, the can came back with a meager
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>amount ot money and Iguess that this
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was the inception of SISA. Ifelt that,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>okay, l’ve done enough fighting the tide
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>let me flow with the current. By that
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>meant, it this group does not have the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>intensity and depth ot my concern for
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>supporting the women of South Atrica,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would form my own group ot women
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>who would do just that. So I convened a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>group of black women and we called
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ourselves the founding mothers of The

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_11_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>B.C.—I want to ask you some very specific
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>questions like who fhe members are now

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of the Sisters of South Africa. But, I think
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that one of the terrible facts about your
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>—frankly—terrible story is the real uncon

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>going on in our own country when it comes
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to the terrible issues of homelessness and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>poverty and starvation and, indeed, race.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>think that in terms of South Africa, if&apos;s very
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>hard for us in the United States to get o
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>very clear picture of it because in South
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Africa we have a totalitarian situation, and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>totalitarianism depends on propaganda.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>There is a fremendous amount of ongoing
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>violence, which is a daily reality for the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>people of South Africa, and almost none of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>it gets into the U.S. press. Ellen Kuzwayo
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and people like Dr. Gloria Joseph, who
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>have been to Atrica, are very important
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>connections for us to know more about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Because the great obstacle, I think, is just
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_14_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>knowing what is going on under Reagan&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>dressmaking. Prior to the development
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of this group, in one village there was
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>just one sewing machine. Ellen Kuzwayc
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and other African women would teach

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The second group is the Maggaba
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Trust. This group of women provides
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>financial assistance to high school anc
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>university students and assists old-age
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pensioners and the disabled. They helx

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and give them food parcels throughou

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>group of women in the Maggaba Trust
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sitting around a table and reading letters
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>from high school and college students
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N001'/>who needed small amounts ot money in
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N002'/>order to refurn to school, in some cases
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N003'/>925 or 85, to buy books or to pay a bill.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N004'/>And, as l said, it touched me to the core
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N005'/>to hear these leffers and to see the women
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N006'/>having to make the decision to help,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N007'/>maybe, half a dozen. This is what made
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N008'/>me think, okay, here’s something that we
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N009'/>can do that will directly help all those
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N010'/>students whose letters were read. So
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N011'/>funds raised for the Maggaba Trust go
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N012'/>directly to the Trust to enable more stu
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N013'/>dents to attend higher education
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N014'/>B.C.—Thats really wonderful. You know
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N015'/>there&apos;s one thing I think most people don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N016'/>know, Gloria, and l have to sayl didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N017'/>know it for a very long time. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N018'/>people talk a lot about Soweto, don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N019'/>think people realize why the riots in Sowetc
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N020'/>happened. Actually the riots in Soweto came
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N021'/>out of a demand of the students to hove
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N022'/>smaller classes and more quality education.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N023'/>When they began to protest, it was not yel
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N024'/>a boycott; they would picket outside the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N025'/>schools after school, demanding more liter
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N026'/>acy. And that pre-boycott picket was met
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N027'/>by the most vicious violence, machine
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N028'/>gunning the young children of Soweto. So
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N029'/>there is something perfect, of course you
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N030'/>know, about your fundraising doing so much
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N031'/>for literacy. Because what we are realh,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N032'/>dealing with here is that most of the people
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N033'/>of South Africa are not supposed to be
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N034'/>literate, are not supposed to be prepared
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N035'/>to live independent lives, and are supposec
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N036'/>to be essentially nothing more than sloves
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N037'/>in the vicious South African economic sys
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N038'/>tem, which the U.S. government supports.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N039'/>Until you read details of this economic
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N040'/>system, you don’t realize the way it absolu-

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N043'/>when you don’t have enough water to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N044'/>drink. These new settlements that are sup

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N046'/>are nothing more than arid strips of lanc
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N047'/>where people are taken after being re
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N048'/>moved from fertile lands near water anc
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N049'/>forests, the Africans&apos; ancestral lands for
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N050'/>hundreds of years; Africans are brought to

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N052'/>even a water pipe and there is rarely

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N054'/>U.S. is supporting, will require so much
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N055'/>effort on the part of so many people to

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>GJ.-There’s so much to say about Ellen
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Kuzwayo. let me just start by saying that

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Ellen says in her book, Call Me Woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>there are thousands of Atrican women

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>They are very much concerned with the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>younger generation.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Incidentally, the film &quot;Awake from
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Mourning” is related directly to Soweto.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The feeling was that the mourning period

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Ellen is also a victim of the white reset

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that is, there was land in her family for
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>close to a hundred years, and when the

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>decided that they wanted this land, land

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>relocation centers. In the Philippine War
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>we called fhem concentrado camps, and of

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_10_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>activities. These necessarily diverted our

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to be a challenge.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>We also were now working with fewer
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>people due partly to burn-out trom the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>fall activities and partly to the fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>many had made a commitment to work
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>only through the campaign. During the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>1984 build up, a committee structure with
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>representatives serving as a coordinating

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>cided on policy. As we moved into 1985,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the coordinating committee became more
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and more the group that did the actual

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Another problem we faced was how
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to get people involved. In 1984 we held
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>regular general meetings where people
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>could plug into committees. With the in

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>people, we found it difficult to take time
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>out to hold general meetings. We now
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>had to find different ways to involve
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>people.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>In mid-1985 we mutvally agreed to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>end FCA’s sponsorship. Art Against
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Apartheid had to decide whether to in
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>corporate as a non-profit organization
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and seek tax-exempt status or to function
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>as a purely activist group. Atter a great
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>deal of debate and investigation, which

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>receive tax-exempt contributions.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Another serious obstacle was a grow-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ing lack of the administrative backup to

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In 1969, I hadn&apos;t a political clue in my 
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>head--not a thought of politics. The thing
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was, the troubles started in 1969, and I 
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>got married in 1969. There is no way in 
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the North that you can divide your per
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sonal life and your political life. Even
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>people who aren&apos;t involved, they see sol
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>diers standing on the street. If their hus
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>bands are politically active, they&apos;re being
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>raided. If their husbands are locked up,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>they are affected. Their private life is a 
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>reflection of the political situation. 
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Every time Ronnie was arrested, it was
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>in a 7-day order. People used to say,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>well, you must be used to him being
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>arrested by now. But, you never get used
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>to it, because each time he is lifted, he
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>might end up charged and away for a 
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lot of years. There&apos;s no way to know. If
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>it&apos;s a 7-day order, you have to wait, and
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>some wives go through mental agony,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>because there&apos;s so many times when
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>they&apos;re beaten up in there. One time in
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>1971, Ronnie was put on the floor and
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>they hooded him. He doesn&apos;t know what
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N026'/>they used, but he had &quot;UVF&quot; hacked into
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N027'/>his arm. It happened at Castlereagh, dur
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N028'/>ing interrogation. So when he came out,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N029'/>he made an official complaint about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N030'/>Then he was charged and convicted of
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N031'/>making malicious allegations against the
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N032'/>police. He was fined £200, but then he
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N033'/>went to High Court, and the judge said
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N034'/>that there was no way the wounds were
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N035'/>self-inflicted. The charges against Ronnie
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N036'/>were dropped, but the judge stopped
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N037'/>short of saying that the RUC did it.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N038'/>He was constantly being threatened by
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N039'/>the RUC; because of his Protestant back
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N040'/>ground, they just couldn&apos;t believe he
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N041'/>would be a Republican. A couple of the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>must have been thinking if I scream loud
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>enough, somebody would hear it—maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>somebody would get help or phone, or
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>something.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Then lheard a couple of shots.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>thought they were shooting through the

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>hand got it. You know, it was nerves

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>been shot. 1 fell back then.1 knew then
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that Ronnie had no chance. There were
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>two of them, and they both were armed,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and I couldn’t do anything to help him,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>you see? In my mind, I thought: I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>want to see him being shot&quot;.Iknew he
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N003'/>was going to die. I didn’t want to have

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N005'/>your life, you’ll see your husband actu
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N006'/>ally gunned down. So l fell back on the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N007'/>bed and just turned away. Iwasn’t look-
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N008'/>ing then. l expected to hear maybe two
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N009'/>shots—because that&apos;s all it would take
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N010'/>to kill him. But, they kept...bang, bang,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N011'/>bang ... shot after shot, and couldn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N012'/>understand what was happening, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N013'/>looked up. Well there must have been o
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N014'/>bit of a struggle, because Ronnie was no
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N015'/>longer in the doorway, he was lying
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N016'/>across the landing. could see the bot
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N017'/>tom half of his body, and this bastard is
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N018'/>standing over him, pumping him with
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N019'/>bullets ... continually firing into his
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N020'/>body...and it was obvious that he was
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N021'/>already dead, but my mind just really
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N022'/>blew then...l just lost control...the only
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N023'/>thought in my mind then was: &quot;Just leave
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N024'/>him alone”. So l jumped up... don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N025'/>know howI managed to grab him with
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N026'/>my hand all shot up, but l grabbed his
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N027'/>jersey and got a good hold of him, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N028'/>was shouting at him: &quot;Leave him alone!
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N029'/>Leave him alone!&quot;I was trying to pull
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N030'/>him, trying to get him away from Ron
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N031'/>nie’s body. He was trying to get ’round
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to have a go at me, but he couldn’t break
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>loose. The other one was at the top of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the stairs—they were so professional
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>—because with me struggling with his
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>friend, he was shooting at me and got
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>me twice more. He hit me once through
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the collarbone and the other went through
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>my right armpit. Well, then l was hit three
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>times, and lhad to fall I couldn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>hold him. He climbed over me then, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>he went down the stairs, much the way
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the Brits would—one went down for
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>wards, and the ofher went down, you
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>know, covering, looking backwards.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was at the top ot the stairs, against the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>wall. 1looked down, and! could see
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Ronnie was dead, because his body was
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>completely white, and his eyes were
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>open, staring, so l knew he was dead
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>then, and they were on their way
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>out ... and the one l had been struggling
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>with, he just lifted his gun then, and shot
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>me in the mouth. So, l thought then, lwas
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>dying. When you are hit in the mouth,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you don’t usvally survive, and all I could
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>think about was the children, you know?
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>So, when l was shot in the mouth, then,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the blood started to go into my lungs.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was I couldn’t breathe, be
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>cause of the blood, and lhad to get
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>down and around to get the blood up.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Sol turned ’round and got down, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the blood was coming up, and what!
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>thought was bones... kept spitting things
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>out ...was my teeth. I lost all my teeth
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>then, and when Iwas bent down, lwas
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>then facing into the baby&apos;s room, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>there was a single bed and the baby&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cot, and the baby was standing in his cot,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>having hysterics. He’d seen the whole
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>thing. He’s 15 months old, and he saw
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>everything. And he was hysterical.I could
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>hear this funny strange noise ... gasping

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>l&apos;d forgotten in all the panic that Noel
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>was there. He died afferwards, because
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>his lung had been perforated, and he bled
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to death. The two other children ...the two
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>girls came out ot the back room. Fionna
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was seven and Dierdre was fhree, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Dierdre was screaming, and Fionna....
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>don’t know how she did it, she was only
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a wee seven ...she was squealing and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>crying ...but she was still a bit sensible.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>had my back to them, you see, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Fionna kept saying: Mommie, what will!
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>do? What will I do? I tried to tell her.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tried to say: &quot;Get out and get help&quot;, but
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>with the bleeding, she couldn’t under
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>stand me, and I had to say it three fimes.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>She stood there and waited ’til l had said
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>it three times and when she understood
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>what l had said, she had to climb over
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>her daddy’s body...he was across the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>top of the stairs, and she had to climb
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>over him, and go down the stairs. So she
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>went over next door, then all the neigh
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>bors came running in, and fhey were
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>horrified, you know, to walk in and see
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>two dead men and me. I told them to get
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the children...l wanted them away.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>never lost consciousness. I didn’t want
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to be touched or moved, because lknew
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>how bad my injuries were. The nurses
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>were holdin’ me up and moving me at
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>different angles, because before could
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>be operated on they had to know what
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sort ot injuries lhad. So, it seemed ages,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and they put me in a small room, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>kept asking to be put out, and they kept
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>saying: &quot;Not yet&quot;. I was shot at half-past
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>three, and they gave me anesthefic at
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>quarter past five.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>He said the reason he couldn’t was
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>because l was six and a halt hours in the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>theater, and he said it was very danger
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ous fo have someone under an anes
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>thetic for such a long time. He said if l&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>been a smoker, l’d have been dead, that
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>my lungs had to have been strong in
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>order to hold up to six and a half hours
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of anesthetic, and that if they had given
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>me anesthetic earlier, l’d have been out
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>too soon, and may not have survived.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>There were three different teams that
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>worked on me. One of the teams worked
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>on my mouth. They spent three hours
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>working on my mouth, and my fongue.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>They had to stitch all my gums, stitching
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>my mouth up, and then l had to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>tracheotomy, and fixing my hand, and
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>all, they stitched it there. It took six and a
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>half hours.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>They didn’t know for the first forty
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>eight hours iflwas going to live or not. It
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>was touch and go, but after the first forty
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>eight hours or so, the doctor said I started
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>to show some improvement, andlwas
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>out of danger then. But, l was in the
			</p>
			<pb n='57'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>intensive care for ten days, and after that
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was in for four weeks all together. The
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>doctors were amazed that I managed to
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>recover so quickly. I had to learn to start
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>swallowing again, because l was fed
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>through a tube with all my throat dam
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>age. I can’t eat without something to
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>drink, because it sticks there, you know?
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>And a lot of times if l am irritated, with a
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tickle in my I cough and you think
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>l’m gonna choke—you’re gaspin&apos;— it
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>doesn’t happen too often, but it frightens
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>people sometimes. But, by and large, all
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>things considered, by the injuries lhad,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>came out ot it sort ot prefty reasonable.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>At the time, l&apos;d have thought that l&apos;d be
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>left with, you know, really horrible injuries.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>My spine is still damaged—l have to
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>see the specialist to consult him again in
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>a couple of months. My own doctor says
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>he doesn’t think there is anything that
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>can be done about the spine. Ifs just too
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>painful, you know, ifl overdo it. Ifl work
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>too hard, l have to have a rest. There are
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>pieces of it missing.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The consulting doctor has said that the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>bullet had gone into my mouth, had
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>knocked my teeth out and part of my
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tongue, and my whole mouth was badly
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>damaged. The bullet had hit my spinal
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>column and richocheted across and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>rested beside the main artery. He said it
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>it had hit the main spinal column dead
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>on, it would have travelled to the brain
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and l’d be dead. You also could be par
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>alyzed from the neck down. There have
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>been a number of people in Beltast shot
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>who are paralyzed trom the neck down.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>So, he said it was lucky it was touching
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>fhe main artery. It was actually leaning
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>against it. It could have punctured it if it
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>moved just a fraction more. But, lrecov
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ered pretty quickly, you know: four
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>weeks.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>When! came out of hospital, I got the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>children back and I went back to the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>same house because lhad all my friends
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and neighbors thatl knew were there.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>didn’t want to go to a strange environ
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ment, you know, where you know no-
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>body. And l had to have friends stay with
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>me for about a month, and l had to have
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>friends stay with me at night, in case
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>needed help during the night. Because
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>when l lay down, 1was wearing the neck
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>brace, and when 1lay down—l wore
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>one of those high surgical collars for
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>about two and a half months afterwards
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>leven had to wear one when lwas
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>sleeping, so it meant that it lwoke up in
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the middle of the night, I couldn’t get up.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Sol went to the same house, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>children were very upset for a while. The
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>baby was fifteen months, and l thought
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>he would be alright, but when I tried to
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>put him in the same room again, he took
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>convulsions—he was screaming, he went
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>purple in the face, he was chokin’ you
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>know? He just panicked when I put him
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in his crib in that room. He&apos;d play in that
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>room during the day, but when you&apos;d put
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>him in the cot in that room, he just went
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>completely hysterical—just stiff, rigid. And
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>took him out, l thought it ws my imagi
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>nation, and l&apos;d put him back a couple of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>hours later, and he&apos;d just do the same
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>thing again, he just took hysterics. You
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>see, he&apos;d seen his father killed and he&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>seen Noel killed. Noel was lying beside
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>him on the floor, and he&apos;d seen me shot,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>you know, and it must have registered.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>So,l had to move his cot into another
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>room. He’s in with the girls now. He
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>won’t sleep in that room. I never tried
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>him back there again.I didn’t want to
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>upset him.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Dierdre is three and she cried for her
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Daddy for three weeks. She kept saying,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>you know, she wanted her Daddy back.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Both her grandparents told her that her
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Daddy was in heaven, and that he
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wouldn’t be back. So she said she wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to go to heaven to see her Daddy. Andl
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>says, you can’t you know—it’s only dead
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>people that can go there. She was only
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>three, and she couldn’t understand, you
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>know, that he couldn’t come back, and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that she couldn’t go to heaven. So she
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cried off and on for about three weeks.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>There’s nothing you can tell a three year
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>old to comfort her. But after a while, she
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>just sort of accepted it. But, the oldest
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>one is seven, and she knows what hap-
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pened. She knew that we&apos;d all been shot,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you know? So, this is ten months now,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and she’s still getting upset. She gets
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>very upset about me. She seems to be
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>very possessive. Not possessive that she&apos;ll
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>follow me everywhere, but when l go
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>out, she worries that l’m not coming back.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>She’s worried about me dying—she says
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that she doesn’t want me to die. And
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>say,&quot; won’t die, l’myoung.&quot;say,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>won’t die ’til you’re grown up.&quot; So she
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>says, then: &quot;I don’t want to grow up then,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Mommy,l don’t want you to die.&quot;Iwent
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>out once and left her with a neighbor.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>fold her lwas going to the Post Office.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was gone about an hour, and when!
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>came back she was sitting on the door
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>step screeching her head off. Normally,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>she’s a very stable child but she was
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>screeching. She thought something had
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>happened to me because lwas gone for
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>so long. She is just completely obsessed

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and 1984, to interview artists about the relationship between
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>their art work and their revolutionary experiences, I was still
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>missing an important link. I had never visited Nicaragua&apos;s At

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of Nicaragua’s history from a unique Black and feminist

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Bluefields, a town of 40,000 people, to receive national and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>international recognition. Self-taught, she has forged her own
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>artistic pathway, emulating neither the abstract tendencies of
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>most Nicaraguan professional artists nor the detailed landscape
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>style of the popular &quot;primitive”, self-taught Solentiname artists.

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>were first brought as slaves from Africa to Jamaica and Haiti,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and then to Nicaragua’s Atlantic coast region in the 1600’s. Nic

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>In contrast, Nicaragua’s dominant Pacific region consists of

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>are distinct from those of the Atlantic coast peoples. Of the total

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>gold
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>During the Somoza era before the 1979 revolution, Bluefields
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>according to June, “was a region that was forgotten and ig
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>nored. No one was encouraged to dream, to think ot the future

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>would sell in Managua. There she used the money to buy fresh

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The encouragement to pursue her career came in 1968 from

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>&quot;So in 1969,&quot; June relates, &quot;l went to Managua to make my-

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her paintings weren’t like the detailed primitive paintings from

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>my paintings reflect this.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>asked June about her political development. She fold me
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>that she had read books about Sandino and the poetry of Pablo
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Neruda. June said, &quot;That did help, because in Bluefields we only
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>used to hear about Sandino being a bandido or bandit. Later
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>could transmit different ideas to my children. So when the FSLN
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>or the Sandinista Liberation Movement came to Bluefields, about

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>on the pretext that they were looking for drugs.&quot; But, June said
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>&quot;they really suspected us artists of anti-Somoza political
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>activities ...Sure enough, no drugs were found, but the artists
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>were all taken to jail.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>June was released the next day. The others were kept in jai
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>for three days, with hoods over their heads. Protests were held
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>by university students to demand the artists’ release.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that lwas against Somoza.&quot; She described the Guardia as &quot;old
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>thieves that scrape out the last drop of blood from the country
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>before they leave. The only thing they can’t take away from us is
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>our revolutionary fervor!&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>At the beginning of the eventful year 1979, June’s son Camilio,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>then about 16 years old, frequently wrote and read papers at
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the student assemblies telling of various supportive FSLN activi
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ties that the students could also join, such as a protest or a strike.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Eventually the Somoza Guardia came to June’s house. &quot;To
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>pick up my son,” she said, &quot;but they let him go. The coman
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>dante talked to me: ’Senora, lheard ...you worked hard to main
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tain your children, your husband never helped you with them.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We just want to know who gives your son the papers he reads
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>at the assemblies’.&quot; She told him, &quot;My son just comes to school
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and finds a paper already on his desk, and then he just reads
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The comandante didn’t seem to believe her, so June recalls,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;llooked him straight in the eye and said, ’T have four children,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and Camilio is the most truthful one. Please talk to him because
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>he can get into trouble’.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>She compared the Guardia to a &quot;bush that has tigers and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>snakes, animals that can eat you. These animals that are in town
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>are more dangerous, so whenever the opportunity comes, you
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>leave.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Soon after, Camilio went to the mountains where he joined
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the Sandinista guerillas and fought against Somoza. June
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>proudly says, &quot;My son was politically convinced and knew il
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>was right, it was the right thing to do. I encouraged him in his
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>political development.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Shortly before the &quot;triumph&quot;, her youngest daughter, then 15,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>also wanted to join the guerrillas. June packed a small bag for
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>her and told her, ...to look out for ...male opportunists who,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>instead of leading you to the guerrillas, take girls into the bush
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and take advantage of them. Check ...to smell if your guide has
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>been drinking.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Sure enough, her daughter returned without letting the guide
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lead her to the guerrillas. She said, &quot;he not only smelled of
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>liquor ...but also of cologne.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Soon after, she and June left for Costa Rica. Shortly before
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the revolution, June said, “The Guardia were walking the streets
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of Bluefields with their guns aimed at the people. The people
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were fold by them that ’Somoza has some nice candies (bullets)
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for you.&quot;&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Each day one to two boatloads of people were leaving
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Bluefields for Costa Rica. During the two weeks June remainec
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>there, she assisted in coordinating facilities for receiving the in
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>flux of Nicaraguan refugees. Immediately after the July 19th
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>triumph, she returned to Managua.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>June ventured forth to the newly formed Cultural Ministry,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>where a new career opened up for her. They needed someone
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to make an inventory ot books on the Aflanfic coast, and June
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>offered to do it. She considered it a good opportunity to learn
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>more about her own Miskito Indian heritage.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>One of her more surprising discoveries during this period of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>travel along the Atlantic coast was the diversity among the vari
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ous Miskito tribes. She was moved by the grave sites and said,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>&quot;I saw the graves, each one with a little tin roof over it. The
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Miskitos thought it was their duty to protect their loved ones
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>from the rain, and, for the first time, lunderstood that very well.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>June candidly described the contents of the Bluefields library,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>established during the Somoza period, as being &quot;full of shit.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The main collection of books consisted of &quot;old romance novels
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from the 1800’s, which couldn’t help these people solve their
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>problems. Before the Somoza Guardia pulled out, they looted

			<pb n='61'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>all the good books, expecially those of the history of the Atlantic
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Coast.&quot; June also fold me that &quot;during the Somoza period only

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>book.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>June was asked to help establish two new Atlantic Coast li
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>braries, at Pearl Lagoon and at Cukra Hill. At the end of 1980,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>she was appointed by the Cultural Ministry as head librarian of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the Bluefields library and, with her two assistants, went to Manq
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>qua for training. Upon her return, she &quot;took the responsibility of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>throwing away a large part ot the library’s old romance nov
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>els.&quot; She had to fight with the town’s administration to support
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the library. She said, &quot;l even invented laws that they didn’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>were not on the books, because they couldn’t read. I did this in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>order to get fheir support.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>When I visited the Bluefields Library, a large square building

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>could now come fo do research or sit and read. Anyone from

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>me, but l had only come to photograph June’s 1978 portrait of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Sandino, displayed on the library’s back wall.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>General Sandino, the heroic symbol of the Nicaraguan Rev
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>olution, is compared to an eagle. A series of blood-red feathers
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>drift downward along one side of Sandino, above the head of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a wounded eagle.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>June painted the portrait clandestinely. In order to maintain
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>inspiration, she would play a cassette of revolutionary songs, or
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of poems read by Ernesto Cardenal. She recalled how &quot;my blood
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pressure sank down to my ankles while I was painting Sandino,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and an official of the Guardia stepped out of his car, came to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>my house and said, ’T have a telegram for you.&apos; It was from the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ltalian Embassy confirming an exhibit of my paintings.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>From several reviews of her work, l also became interested
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in a particular painting from a series she did in the late ’70s
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>titled “The Funeral of Machismo&quot;, or “The Funeral of Male
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Domination.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>While the form of a proud, beautiful rooster dominates the

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>nant woman and a grandmother, all shaking their fists at the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>rooster. June comments about the common plight ot most
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>women, &quot;Even it you’re a doctor, lawyer or teacher, when you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>come home trom your job, you work at home while your hus

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Since the Revolution, apart from her library work, June has
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>been integrated into the Artists&apos; Union and the ASTC, the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Sandinista Association of Cultural Workers. These organizations
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>arrange for national and international exhibits, the purchase of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>art supplies, and a general interchange among the artists.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>In 1981, June traveled with others, at government expense, to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the Festival of the Caribbean in Barbados. Eight of her paint
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ings were on display there, and she described the colors she
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>used at that time to depict skin tone as being &quot;pure brown, like
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>the color of instant coffee.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>June relates that, during the Festival, another artist &quot;looked at
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>my painting of Bluefields’ people and said, This is what you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>call Black? This is not Black. These are hybrids. Black skin has a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>tinge of blue.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>June continued, &quot;So I came home and experimented until !
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>got my own black skin color, and that was the turning point in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>my painting.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Since the Revolution there have been many changes in Nica
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>ragua and in June’s life. When she looks back upon her 52 years,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>she says, &quot;I never expected some of the good things that have
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>happened ...the achievement of painting something, when lhave
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the idea to do it,...and to be free to paint what I want.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Besides selling her work with ease through ASTC, June has
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>received special awards in the annual July 19th exhibits of Nic
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>aragua’s artists. In 1983, she won the first prize for the portrait,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Black Sandino”. I found this painting and others at the Gran
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Hotel Performance and Exhibition Center in Managua. Among
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>them was the &quot;Fruit Vendors&quot; The two women seem to converse
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and laugh together as if they are enjoying a good joke or some
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>gossip. One woman holds a basket of mangos, the other avo
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cados. But it is their facial expressions, their open mouths re
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>vealing carefully painted white teeth in contrast to their dark
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>black skin, that seem to be the focus of this painting.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>June concluded her story with these thoughts: “The goal that
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>set for myself is also for my people. I would like to leave a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>heritage for coming generations, a museum of paintings, here

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ings. I have a long way to go, but l’II make it.

				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_142' n='N001'/>In searching for the artist, or creator, of Greenham, one might
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_148' n='N002'/>consider Anne Pettit, who organized a protest march against
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_154' n='N003'/>Cruise missles2 from Cardiff in Wales to the Greenham Com
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_160' n='N004'/>mon military base, located 50 miles west of London, in the late
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_166' n='N005'/>summer of 1981. But very quickly one would also discover that
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_172' n='N006'/>Greenham was also created by 36 women and four men
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_178' n='N007'/>who made up the march. They, like Anne Pettit, were &quot;worried,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_184' n='N008'/>anxious, and isolated&quot; (words familiar to all artists) about the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_190' n='N009'/>threat of nuclear missiles and wanted to express their feelings in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_196' n='N010'/>a visible, public way. When they arrived at the end of their ten-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_205' n='N011'/>day march, four of the women decided to chain themselves to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_211' n='N012'/>the fence surrounding the base and swore to stay there until the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_l_217' n='N013'/>British Minister of Defense would discuss the Cruise issue on

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Regardless of who was &quot;first,&quot; the creation of Greenham is,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>by no means, finished. It is still being created today. An open,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>evolving work in a perpetual state of flux, Greenham is a lead
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>erless entity of women (men visit but do not live there or take
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>part in the actions). It ranges from small handfuls of camper
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>activist-creators to fens ot fhousands who come to take part in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the large, organized polifical events occurring fhere year-round.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>If you pulled up the international peace movement of the ’80s
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>by its roots—firmly planted in the soil of human collectivity
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>—you’d find Greenham Common. The first of 102 peace camps
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in Great Britain, it has served as paradigm and inspiration to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>activists throughout the world.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In September 1981, when the first camp was spontaneously
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>set up at the main gate to support fhe four women chained to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the fence, the base commander strode out to utter the fateful
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>underestimation: &quot;As far as l’m concerned, you can stay as long
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as you like.&quot;“ Since that time, thousands and thousands have
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stayed, somefimes a day, somefimes for months, at one or sev
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>eral of the nine campsites at each ot the gates around the base.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>If you go there, you will find at least a small band of “the peo
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ple who never give up” gathered at each of the color-identified
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>gates (named for the colors of the rainbow by Greenham
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>women).” Soon it will occur to you that you are not just an ob
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>server. By being fhere, by seeking it out, you have already taken
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a stand at some level and become a part of the flow that is
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Greenham.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The lifestyle in the camps is, both of necessity and by ideol
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ogy, extremely spartan. Ideologically, dependency on the mod
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ern &quot;necessities&quot; of lite is seen as a predatory affitude, cultivating
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>greed and competition. But the campsites are also kept porta
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ble for another reason: eviction. There is a consistent effort by
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>local and national governments to silence or disperse the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>women. Bulldozers are brought in, cars are impounded, camps
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>demolished, women arrested. But Greenham continues—it re
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>fused to go away.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>As a newcomer, you’Il be affracted by the camp’s welcoming
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>spirit. Drawn to the campfire, where hot water for tea and meals
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>in-a-pot are made in charred-black pans, you’Il begin to take in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the scene. Plastic is thrown over branches (carefully so as to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>avoid damage to trees)—and these &quot;benders&quot; are home. There
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>are no toilets. Only a few lawnchairs. But banners strung in the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>air or on the fence nearby convey messages of peace and po

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>every day? It is something that, in the mainstream of daily lite,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>could be called an endangered species: imagination. Again and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>again, when one reads about or talks with people who have
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>been there, there is reference to Greenham’s ability to cap
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ture” the imagination. For Greenham is a studio of imaginative
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ideas for actions. Like politically conscious artists, these women
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>are driven not just because they have fears (they do), but be
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>cause they are not atraid to imagine.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>With direct action as the medium and nonviolence as the con
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>tent, their civil disobedience defies categorization (some actions
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>seem to be activist art, others more like artistic politics, still oth
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>ers theatrical performances). The Greenham women invade fer
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>ritories of art and politics with equal irreverence, and their joytul
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>smashing of decorum has become the banner of a new form.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>Whatever their title, Greenham’s designs are contributions to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>ward structural change. They have a directness and a commu
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>nicative accessibility that stem from a desire to bring both art
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>and politics out of their class and out of their &quot;high art&quot; and

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>The ideas for actions may be anyone’s, even yours, although
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>no one is expected to participate unless they want to. The ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>are discussed, sometimes altered, often sent around to the ofher
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>gates (to avoid &quot;gatism&quot;—the hoarding of plans or informa
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>tion). There are frequent evening gatherings, with discussions
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>held in a circle to allow all voices to be heard and to encourage
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>listening and equal participation. The intention is to share knowl
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>edge and to teach each other in a supportive, nonhierarchical
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>way. There are almost no solitary actions, but fhere are many
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>with only a tew people, and some with large numbers. All are
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pieces in the expanding collage of world-wide nonviolent con
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>frontations that have brought disarmament to life.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>As you walk from gate to gate along the nine miles of fence
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>surrounding the base, you can see evidence of these actions.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Some bunkers and buildings have huge whitewashed signs that
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>read &quot;For Rent&quot;; others are covered with peace and woman
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>symbols. The fence itself is pinned with pictures and messages
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of peace, and it has become a literal patchwork, woven to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>gether by the soldiers who must constantly repair the damage
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>done by Greenham women. Rejecting this barrier that sepa
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>rates inside from outside, the women cut through, crawl under,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>or climb over the nine-foot-high chain-link enclosure topped
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and reinforced by rolls of barbed wire. In their almost nightly

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Other ideas take advance planning, as when the womer

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>All acts are kept as unpredictable as possible so that authori

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>days or political occasions, including Greenham birthdays. The
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>first of several massive actions was held in December 1982.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Hoping for enough people to reach all the way around the base,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the Greenham network transformed itself into 30,000 women
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>who encircled the nine-mile fence and linked hands in an &quot;em
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>brace of the base.&quot; Then, at a festival in 1983, called “The Rain

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>But it was quite another thing to pull the

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Similarly, none of the so-called social programs, without which
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>there literally would be tremendous starvation in this country
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>would be passed it they were perceived as weltare programs.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>They pass if they support the milk lobby by buying up all thot
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>damn milk which is overproduced, instead of letting it go on the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>market and lower the price. The government guarantees to buy
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the milk and turns it into miserable, oversalted, overpreserved
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cheese that people have to stand on line to get. If’s a weltare
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>system for the agriculture business in this country.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>For instance, you now find (it you know anything about the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>surplus food program) we’re suddenly geffing raisins up the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>kazoo. Why raisins and prunes all of a sudden? Ifs really an
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>interesting story. When Carter was President, the surplus was
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>peanuts. You couldn’t use enough peanuts, peanut oil, peanut
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>buffer, peanut granules, and dried peanuts. And thaf&apos;s because
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>peanuts come from fhe area he represented. Along comes our
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>California person and all of a sudden we’ve got prunes and rai
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>sins that we don’t know what to do with. I got a call from a soup
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>kitchen, and they said, &quot;You know, we used to get some chickens;
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>now all of a sudden we’re getting prunes.&quot; Ii&apos;s been said that it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>an affempt to regulate fhe poor.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ll’s clearly a support and weltare system on a very large scale
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>for the old agriculture lobbies. The system has been turned
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>around, and everyone who happens to be poor has been made
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>to feel guilty about geffing any of the benefits of these programs.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>B.C.—I want to ask you to talk about the food program that has,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>with the aid of computers, figured out that to survive a family needs
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>§57, 558 a week for meals. Is that it?
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>K.G.-That’s the food stamp program. So you don&apos;t think that
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>they just arrive at some amount of money for tood stamps off
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the top of their heads—nutritionists in Maryland figure out the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>least amount of food that a person needs to survive. They call
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that the Thrifty Food Plan. I love the kind of words that these
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>people come up with. They plan a menu for a tamily ot two,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>three, four, whatever it is, and produce this little booklet called
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;Make Your Food Dollars Count.&quot; It is then available to anyone
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>who wants it and contains menus. Theorefically these people in
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Maryland go out and shop for this stuff and whatever it costs
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>then determines the amount of the food stamp allocation. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>case of a family of four, this plan ended up costing $58 a week.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>We went out and bought the same menu—and it’s pretty lousy.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>It cost $79.71 to buy the same thing in New York City, but there&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>no adjustment for that. So a family of four who lives on food
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>stamps and public assistance falls behind 521.73 every week.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Now, you figure it out for yourself; if every week you fell behind
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that much, you&apos;d be in a lot of trouble, and thaf&apos;s exactly the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>story. These families are in trouble. That’s why they come to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>soup kitchens and emergency food pantries by the third week
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of the month. They’ve only gotten 558 of assistance, and they
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>can’t make it anymore.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>B.C.-One of the figures you cite in your Community Food News
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>breaks down to 47 cents a meal. What kind of meal, you rightfolly
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ask? This is so mean-spirited. Lefs look at what a Trident costs or
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>one of fhose liftle planes that are boom-booming over Managua
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>right now.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>K.G.-Let me read you a couple of things from the Thrifty Food
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Plan. This menu has one can ot grapefruit sections, three scram
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bled eggs, and cinnamon toast. That&apos;s breakfast for a family of
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>four. Peanut butter and banana sandwich for lunch. Again, you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>supposed to cut a banana in three parts for three kids. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>not the way people should live. You can sit in a lab and play
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>around and figure out exactly the amount of calories but you try
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>surviving on that amount. And thaf&apos;s the way a lot ot people are
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>living. If’s very hard for people who are fortunate enough not to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>have to live that way to conceive of what it’s like to have nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to fall back on every damn day; it you do turn to someone, if&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to a neighbor or a cousin or an aunt who doesn’t have a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>more than you do. You’re dealing with an enormous population
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>out there that&apos;s not working. This society is not working well.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>According to the numbers given out by the City of New York,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>25% of the city’s population is considered to be living in pov
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>erty. That means a family of four is living on $10,600 or less.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Currently that is the poverty line. If you’re living on public assis
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>tance, you get about 83% of that. How can a family of four
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>living on 98,300 a year pay rent, get on the subway, buy clothing
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>or a pair of sneakers? Kids grow out of their shoes. Do you
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>know what Pampers or a diaper service costs? How do you
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>afford that? li&apos;s impossible.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Many people have a hard time believing the extent of hunger
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and deprivation in this city, where you can walk around on Fifth
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Avenue and see the most incredible kinds ot wealth and then go
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>just a few blocks away and find people living in the kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>poverty where the statistics translate into real life. Iam not talk
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ing here about the 30 or 40 or 50 thousand homeless people
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>who are special cases. l’m talking mostly about people with
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>families. The people in the shelter system in this city actually
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>number some 4,000 families, including 17,000 children.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>l’m really glad to be doing this interview on a women’s pro
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>gram because, to a large degree, the families we’re talking
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>about are female-headed households that no longer have a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>home. Thats essentially it—a woman with two or three chil

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>dren. In fact, the system is absolutely unprepared if there is a
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>man present. There are so few men present that they don’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>any place for them. The weltare hotel system is strictly for women
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and children. To a great extent, the hotels don’t allow men on
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the premises, and even very good programs like the Red Cross
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and a group called Women in Need in Manhattan just don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>have the facilities. It rarely happens that men are around, so
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>they don’t knock themselves out to have the facilities.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Single-room occupancy housing has pretty much disappeared
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>in the last few years because the Koch administration has been
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>giving away a lot ot tax breaks to developers, who are convert
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ing fhese places into condominiums. And no low income hous
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ing is being built at all because the federal government abso
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lutely has stopped supporting it. But it’s more that a lack ot
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>federal money. The fact is that they have allowed housing thaf&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>really quite good to disappear or be made into condominiums,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>if it’s in a great location, or be abandoned in places like Brook
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>lyn and the Bronx. So you have the situation on the Grand Con
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>course in the Bronx, which has really good housing, built in 1920,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>1930, quite new in comparison to the Lower East Side—and all
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>they do is put fake windows in, with flower pots painted on
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>them.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>B.C.—And they spent thousands of dollars on that.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>K.G.-Hundreds of thousands of dollars to make it look like
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>someone lives there. Now we have a network ot weltare hotels
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and mass shelters. The shelters are in armories and places like
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that, and some of them are quite terrible. The families are al
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>lowed to stay during the day, but the men have to go out even if
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>if’s zero degrees outside.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>B.C.—And they don’t have lockers. In fact, this is true for some
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>women’s shelters as well. Thats why people walk around with all
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>fheir possessions all day long and go back as late as possible into
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fhose unpleasant shelters. Theyre nothing more than a cot and a
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>toilet.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>K.G.-People don’t even want to go there. The reason people
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>go to Grand Central is that they’re afraid of these places. A lot
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of the people in the shelters are part of the group that has been
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>deinstitutionalized from mental institutions over the last fewyears.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Many of the people are afraid of each other and rightfully so.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ll’s a horrible system.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>But l really want to talk more about the families. In New York,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>whatever the reason, housing has disappeared. What happens?
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>People start doubling and tripling up. Now the city admits that,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>in public housing, 19% of the families are doubled up. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>unheard of. l1&apos;s not even allowed. Whey they let something hap
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>pen thaf&apos;s actually against the rules, something big is going on.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>These people are afraid to move because where would they
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>go? You’ve got this situation where families, mostly women and
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>children, suddenly find themselves without any place to live. You
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>can live with your mother for a while or ask your neighbor to
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>take you in. Then, after a while, that becomes intolerable, and
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>you have to move out and go to one ot the city’s emergency
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>shelters. There is no place for the city to place you. The upshot is
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>that we’ve got this system of weltare hotels that are so horrible
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>it’s hard to imagine them if you’ve never been in one.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>B.C.—And, as you’ve pointed out to me and others, this is some
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>fhing the women’s movement seems not to have responded to yet.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>lf&apos;s not part of our agenda. One of the reasons l’ve been so eager
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>to talk to you is that it has to become part of our agenda. We reclly
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>have to become involved. If’s unconscionable to live in a society as
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>rich and varied as ours is and to have homeless people, as if this
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>were Calcutta at the end ot the empire.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>l’d like to tell one story about how Kathy Goldman transformed
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the way that l personally see homeless women. One night we leff a
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>very nice restaurant and right oufside the door was a freezing young
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>woman, maybe 25. She said, &quot;You know, can l have some money?
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and my instinct is always to give young or old women who are in
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>need some money. But Kathy didn’t do that. Kathy said to her, very
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>vigorously, &quot;Where are you going to spend the night?&quot; This woman
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>was immediately transformed from somebody who didn’t have a
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>parficular face to somebody we had to connect and relate to. She
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>fold Kathy where she might spend the night if she could get in. And
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>it dawned on me that, although there are some shelters, there are
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>so many homeless women that not everybody can get in. If this
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>young woman couldn’t get in fhere, she’d have no place to go.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Kathy gave her a card and said, &quot;Ifyou can’t get in, call this number.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was impressed with the fact that each of us individvally, if we
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>have more knowledge and greater awareness, can do more. So

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>situation. For the most part, you don’t see families with children
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in the street. Though I will say, we run a community kitchen up
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>on 114th Street and two nights in a row a family—a pregnant
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mother in her ninth month, ready to give birth, a 14-month-old
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>baby, and the father—showed up. Around Thanksgiving they
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>had lost the place where they had been living, and it was now
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>nearly Christmas. They had been wandering around ever since.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Up to the point when they came in to our place for some food,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>they had been living on the A train at night.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Isaid to the woman, &quot;Where are you going to have the baby?
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and she said, &quot;I don’t know, it depends....&quot; In other words, it
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>would depend on where the train happens to be when she goes
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>into labor which hospital she would go to. It’s absolutely unbe
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lievable that this goes on. You mentioned something the other
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>day about someone on their way to the 65th Street Armory who
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>had been released from a hospital.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>B.C.—The very next night after Kathy and I left that restaurant,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>began to see with new eyes the reality of helping an individual
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>person. We saw a very old woman, very fragile, staggering on Park
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Avenue. She had evidently just gotten out of a car or taxi. We went
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>over and asked, &quot;Can we help you?
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>She was looking for the big shelter on Park Avenve. We walked
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>her over there, she could hardly walk. She had just been released
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>from a hospital after having surgery and looked like she was still
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>coming out of anaesthesia. When we got her to the shelter, there
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was some discussion about whether she was old enough to be
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>admitted.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>said to the young man asking her these ridiculous questions—on
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>this freezing night as she was really about to fall over—“Aren’t you
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>going to take this woman in, no matter what her age is?” He said,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>&quot;Maybe, maybe not.&quot; It turned out she had been there before, and
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>so he took her in and was very nice to her. But this is the story
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>—each one of these individual tragedies is a history to tell and to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>write and to be outraged by. Every one of us does have a real
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>responsibility to look at whats going on with much more perceptive
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and caring eyes.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>K.G.-What you raised before is really the crucial thing. We know
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>that the women’s movement has always been a middle-class
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>movement and has always been crificized because ot that. But it
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>seems to me that, at this point, the women’s movement has to get
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>its act together and begin to pay some affention as a group to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>what’s happening to other women. We can’t allow 4,000 women
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to live in these terrible, rat-infested, roach-ridden hotels, where
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to get a roll of toilet paper they have to give ’sexval favors, as
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>theyre called, to the maintenance people. If’s absolutely the most
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>degrading thing in the whole world. Where is the women’s move
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ment? If NOW can be interested in equal pay—and I agree
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that that is an important issue—they also have to pay attention
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to what is happening to their sisters, whether they like it or not.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Their sisters really need help. Where is the outrage? Where are
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the women who can do something about this systemically?
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>B.C.-We need organized protest and organized vision. We need
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>to write arficles about this so we can deal with our representatives
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>who, it appears, aren’t doing anyfhing. Where are our public women
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>who can speak? There’s a whole movement that has to happen,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>and it is as important as the Peace Movement. In fact, if&apos;s the other
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>side of it, the result of some of our current failures and military
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>obsessions. The budget of the US Air Force is larger than the total
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>educational budget for the 1.2 billion children of Africa, Latin Amer
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ica and Asia, and this is all coming home. Il&apos;s not an accident that

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>think. They actually opened up the houses, began renovating

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>arrested. It seems to me that what Acorn did is something we

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The other thing is that the cost to the city, state, and federal
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>governments of these welfare hotels is astronomical. They pay

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with it if we were, other than label it symbolically. One form
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>seems to lend itselt more readily when the focus is on the human
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>element, the second when the matter to be dealt with is the physi
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cal property itselt. Both are essential. For most of us, the choice
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>is made after much prayer, and it acting in community, through
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>much reflection. Also essential is the element of celebration, play
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and pure fun. Resistance is serious but seldom grim.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The trick is not to take yourself too seriously. When you get
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>people conspiring fogefher in celebration, you’re going to have
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>fun. I wouldn’t act in situations where this element is missing.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Part of the ability to celebrate and have fun comes in the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ability to renounce the fruits of one’s action. Quite the opposite
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of the military where the fruits are the only thing that count (num
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ber of enemy killed, territory conquered). We know that life has
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>already overcome death, love overcome hatred. Our individual
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>acts will not end the arms race, but our love and fidelity and
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>obedience will. So we can relax and enjoy. The fact that we do
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>so mystifies and somefimes angers ofhers. I was once fold by a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Secret Service agent, &quot;Stop grinning! You’re in serious trouble.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>l’d never had so much fun in my life. It feels good to do good
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Even when handcuffed to a wall for 4 hours. So much of what
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>we do stifles the human spirit. Most Americans hate their work
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>(therefore ulcers, tranquilizers, early heart attack), hate their fam
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ilies (divorce, refusal to have children, child neglect and abuse).
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>So many don’t knów why they live as they live except that every
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>one lives that way and it’s hard to stop. Resistance begins with a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>kind of liberation from that spiritual death, and the feeling after

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>privately) can escape becoming &quot;political&quot; or &quot;useful&quot;. To make

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>appropriate, but thaf’s a far cry from planning the witness as a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>media event (in which case it&apos;s not a witness at all.) It doesn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>even make sense. The Day After and Helen Caldicott on the

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>on the ofher hand, agreed to represent
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>us pro bono. Their enthusiasm about the

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>We never found out if the police knew
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>about the project in advance. We don&apos;t

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>without significant interruption.)
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>After the information meeting, our two
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>lawyers met with me and the other orga
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>nizers to review the material they would
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>be presenting to the training meetings.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>The training meetings were a very crifical
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>part of the event. We wanted to make
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>sure all participants understood the risks
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>involved with the project and would know
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>how to conduct themselves in the event
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>they were apprehended by a police
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>officer.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Alisting of all the legal information
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>was prepared. Essentially the shadow

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>a list of locations to avoid). They were
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>also informed about what not to carry.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Since participants could be searched, no
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>one was allowed to have any drugs,

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>If participants were stopped by the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>oolice, they needed to know how to act
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>in order to prevent the sitvation from
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>escalating. To avoid being prosecuted
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>for harrassment, they could not stand too
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>close to an officer, extend a hand, or
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>spray saliva on him/her during the course
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>of a conversation. Furthermore, using
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>obscene language could result in a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>charge of disorderly conduct. Resisting

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>an officer were serious violations that
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>parficipants needed to avoid. They were

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>also instructed about what to expect it

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The most difficult concept to which ev
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>eryone had to agree was not talking to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the police. Many participants thought they
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>could talk their way out of arrest or con
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>vince the police officer of the merit of the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Shadow Project as well as of the horrors
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of nuclear war. The afforneys did a su
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>perb job persuading the participants that
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>what they said would certainly be held
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>against them. Their conversation was to be
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>limited to &quot;l want my lawyer.&quot; When one
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>shadow painter, stopped by a police
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>officer, quickly responded as instructed
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the officer laughed and replied, &quot;For
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>such a silly thing?” (Another officer
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>walked by a painter and complimented
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>her on her good work.)
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The presence of the aftorneys during
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the training was crucial. It gave parfici

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>information seriously. In fact, the one
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>person taken into custody was the only
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>person who had not attended the frain
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ing meeting. He neglected to carry iden

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the organizers, which probably didn’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the same impact on him.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>After four identical training meetings
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>were held, we had 200 participants in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>volved in the project, far exceeding our
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>expectations and making the event larger
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>than the one in New York. With such a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>large group it became important to de
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>centralize. We divided the city into five

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>each with its own supply headquarters.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Each team of three was given five gal

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>phone numbers. We established a hot line
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for shadow painters to call in the event
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ot arrest. The people answering the phone

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Our caution even led us to consult the

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>During the project, 19 participants
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>were cited and one taken into custody.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>He was out by 10 am the next morning.
