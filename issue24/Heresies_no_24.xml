				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Lyn Blumenthal,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>1948-1988,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>who was an associate
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>member of Heresies.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>This statement appeared in the very first issue of Heresies in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>January 1977 and in every following issue. It remains pertinent.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Heresies is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of art and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>what is commonly called art can have a political impact and that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in the making of art and all cultural artifacts our identities as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women play a distinct role. We hope that Heresies will stimulate
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dialogue around radical political and aesthetic theory, as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>generate new creative energies among women. It will be a place
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to broaden-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing the definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Heresies is published by a collective of feminists, some of whom
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>are also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists; our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, litera
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ture, performance, art history, architecture, filmmaking, photog
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>raphy, and video. While the themes of the individual issues will
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>be determined by the collective, each issue will have a different
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>editorial staff, composed of members of the mother collective
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and other women interested in that theme. Heresies provides
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>experience for women who work editorially, in design, and in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>production. An open evaluation meeting will be held after the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>appearance of each issue. Heresies will try to be accountable
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to and in touch with the international feminist community.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tween our lives, our arts, and our ideas have been suppressed.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Once these connections are clarified, they can function as a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and to understand the relationship between art and politics,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>work and workers. As a step toward the demystification of art,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art within
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the present system, which has often become the relationship of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set of genius-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>products just because they are made by women. We are not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the compe
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>titive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of femi-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>nism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>You are the reason we started Heresies in 1977. We built this magazine on a simple
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>premise: feminist art is not only rooted in the real world, but in the art world.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Once upon a time, not so long ago, the notion that art and politics can mix was
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a heretical thought. Feminist art was viewed as &quot;propaganda,‚Äù or even worse, as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;sociology.&quot; Feminists, of course, were deeply committed to both subjects and determined to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>demonstrate that art, at its best, was indeed &quot;propaganda,‚Äù and moreover, could have an effect
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>on &quot;sociology,‚Äù by unraveling the discourses that construct it.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>As a result, we decided to publish a magazine that gave equal space to women‚Äôs art,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>criticism, and articles (including fiction and poetry) on the social issues that inspire feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>-artists or not. Twelve years ago when we began, there were almost no art magazines that took
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>women‚Äôs art seriously. From the beginning, one of our long-term goals has been to carve out a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>significant place for feminist art, but before this mission could be accomplished, it was necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to make this work visible. Twelve years ago, you saw art by certain (familiar at long last) women
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>artists in Heresies‚Äîfirst.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>And you saw much more than art. For example, two of our most significant and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>controversial issues‚ÄîThe Great Goddess (45), and The Sex Issue (+12),‚Äîbroke new ground
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>within debates that are still crucial to the project of feminism. The uneven progress of Heresies is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>not unlike the uneven progress of the feminist art movement itself. We have made mistakes,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>angered readers and authors on occasion (not to mention one another), but we have also brought
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>you reams of material on the crucial issues that have informed our movement and shaped our art.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Where have we been? Where are we going? This is our Anniversary issue, and Anniversary
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>issues are supposed to tackle the Big questions. But, like all Heresies issues, this one doesn‚Äôt
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>contain any Big answers. What it does do, however, is offer apicture of where we are right now.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>We are pleased with this issue because it touches on some of the same themes we have
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>considered over the years, yet it goes further, updating and continuing to investigate some of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the ideas that we hope will continue to inspire, if not push, the women‚Äôs art movement in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>an even more radical direction.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>in class, smiled at me. She asked the teacher
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>if she could sit next to me in order to share
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>her book with me and help me with the new
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>reading assignment. I liked her right away. By

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>done; he would have bought me a personal gift. So I bought
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>myself an eggshell-and-peach-colored trashmaster. I don‚Äôt know

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>And then I heard about two more anniversaries that day
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>One was HERESIES. This is evidently a magazine about little

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>girls, I heard of another urgent anniversary. Once again we

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It‚Äôs very hard to get a firm but dainty grasp on all of this. There

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>have called this protest of rowing versus wading. I don‚Äôt know

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in there or wading, but evidently the wrong story won. I fought

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>To frame the questions for this project, I spent over a year noting
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>my thoughts about how spirituality, new paradigm thinking,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ecofeminism, and ecology (or simply, for the purpose of these

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Goddess spirituality to the present. This evolution has broadened
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and deepened into a philosophic world view now shared by many.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>By including many voices I have tried to present a sampler of the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>current dialogue and indicate the thinking of many of the prominent
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>writers whose books and teaching have helped to articulate issues
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of spirituality. (A list of books is included in this issue.)
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>For this anniversary issue of Heresies, I used my ‚ÄúStory-

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>there is a spiritual dimension to it? How would you discuss it?

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>With great care and concern! What I mean when I say

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>dis-communication. After many years of trying to talk about
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>it personally I give up! One person‚Äôs &quot;new paradigm‚Äù is

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The emerging paradigm involves, among other processes, a
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>resymbolization of experience; one that reexamines, thereby
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>revalues, segments of social and natural reality that were cast
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>out as shadows. And I don‚Äôt mean to imply that this revaluing
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>will mean bringing that which has been shadow into light.

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>inviting unknowing-that which is beyond direct physical,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>emotional, and mental manipulation-to serve as guide and
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>source of power, rather than treating it as an illness to be

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Very difficult to discuss. Our description of reality is so
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>fractured. We do not have a vocabulary that allows us to
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>speak directly about the wholeness of experience. Think how
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>absurd it is that one must write ‚Äúwholeness of experience.‚Äù
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>All dimensions, for example, are spiritual. Matter and spirit
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>are not separate. Many aspects of the &quot;new paradigm&quot; point

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>everything is spiritual, it is also political.) In the new paradigm
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>what is &quot;spiritual‚Äù no longer belongs in a separate ‚Äúuntouch-

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Lately there is a great deal of confusion about this. A sort of
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>equation of &quot;spirituality‚Äù and social apathy, or worse
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>&quot;forbearance.&quot; Truth telling and the refusal to collaborate
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with wrong-doing are essential spiritual acts. In order to

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>art world is in love with cynicism. That makes sense in a

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Not really a shift. Not a vision. Artists make possible a new
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>kind of seeing. Cynicism is tired and the old, deadened and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>deadening way of seeing. The lens is opening up now, in any
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>case, despite the art world. Art doesn‚Äôt always obey the

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>now sell as art objects would no longer be created to function
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in a secular society. Art would be used for sacred ceremonies,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>rituals, etc. Art would be judged by its energies; it might even
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>be given as a sacred gift or offering. Thus, ultimately, the art
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_10_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>business would be sacrilegious. If art takes on a sacred,

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>This is much like our confusion about politics. If the aims of

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>enriches the work being done. If members of a group still

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>not for all. Many rituals in which I have participated seem
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>jerry-made and lack the awesomeness and mystery of what

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tradition in which the participants were fully grounded. The

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>This is particularly true of &quot;speaking‚Äù in

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Perhaps the most important book to
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>look at in this regard is Morrison&apos;s The
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Bluest Eye. When I first read this book, I
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was deeply troubled by Pecola‚Äôs charac-
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>terization as a victim of incest and by

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>such a story was hopelessly negative, not
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>transformational or transcendent in a
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>manner I considered essential to creative
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>acts. Now however, I think that in the
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>relationship between Pecola and Claudia,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>who serves as narrator for much of the

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>men to work and bring ‚Äôem back that morning, and l‚ÄôIl swear it seemed like
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>it was seven, or before eight o‚Äôdock that the bomb went off. l had to go take
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the men up to T-Tunnel sone of the access tunnels to the underground excavation
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>where the nuclear bombs are detonated). I was sitting there drinkin&apos; my coffee,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>waitin‚Äô for the boys to get through eatin‚Äô and git on the bus. We was sitfing
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>in the mess hall, up on the mountain, and down on the flat here, not quite
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>six miles we was from it, it blowed plumb out of the ground.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Boy it shook. A blast, sounded like 40 sticks of dynamite went off. It popped!
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>mean it sounded like a dap o‚Äô thunder ... ka-POW!!! And that turned our
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>coffee cups over, we fhought the mess hall was comin&apos; down, and we run
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>outside, and look right down the hill, and a big red flame and black smoke
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>was going up just like that bomb did during the war at lwo Jima.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Just like that!
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>And so they made me take that load of men, get a load ot men on the bus,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and go on up to T-Tunnel, and l had to go right down there towards where
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the bomb went offl!! We went up and the men said, &quot;Go into T-Tunnel anc

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>We‚Äôll call you ... you stand by&quot;&quot; So pretty soon it seemed like l was there
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>about 30 minutes. I was sitting on the bus. I never did go into the funnel ..
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>‚Äôcause they told me that radiation would never hurt you, back then. It was

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>minds what they were going to do. I could just see it, on my hands. Pink
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>kind of pink-lookin‚Äô stuff. Like a pink dust, my car inside was just covered
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>with it. The 18th of December, 1970, that was the Baneberry.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>So they took us up to the bathhouse, and it was snowin‚Äô. When we got there

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>man,&quot; they said, &quot;get out of that car and get in that bathhouse!&quot; And went
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in there, and the damn hot water had broke down. We all had to take baths
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in ice-cold water. And l&apos;d step in there and take my bath, l&apos;d step out, he&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>run that Igeiger counter over me and shove me back in there to take anoth

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>think they got it out of my hair. The thing would just keep d&apos;dickin&apos; when l&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>step up and I thought l was going to freeze to death in the ice-cold water.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>That‚Äôs enough to kill a man, right there! In the wintertime and snowingl
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>They just ruined my car. Steamed it for nine weeks. Yep, that‚Äôs how they go
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the radiation out of it. After they did all that, anyway, they took us out to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Mercury. Had medics up there, and they tested us until four o&apos;dock in the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>morning. l‚Äôm not kiddin‚Äô you. They just kept coming. We was settin‚Äô on the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>bus there and they&apos;d run us in, and test us, test us, test us all night. And
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>finally they sent us home with a pair of coveralls, paper coveralls on, and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>paper shoes. At four or five the next morning we got home.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Wwo years after Baneberry, Walter Adkins still suffered from a dry, hacking cough
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>&quot;I always thought l had a cold workin on me.&quot; Since the accident, he dlwoys

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>which set off a coughing fit. I thought l had a cold all the time, but it was thai

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Since Baneberry, Walter Adkins has had a malignant tumor removed trom his
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>windpipe. A heart bypass was performed to allow for the future removal ot his lung.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Three weeks after the bypass operation, Adkins coughed up a cuptul of blood and

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>later his entire lung was removed. He died in the autumn of 1988. For years Adkins

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>thus be advisable to take a stringent look

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>When she was thirteen she became

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>down to the soup kitchen and ladle out
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>some slop for those beggars and mooch

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>towns. It was easier once, no doubt, to
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>choose between being a Wobblie organiz-

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and skin; live in the Present!
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>No, no more procrastinating! I will
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>triumph over indecision. But how? Should

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>is to do something, anything. Sign a

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>metastasis of hope? Maybe I ought to
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>write a note, admonishing my congress
