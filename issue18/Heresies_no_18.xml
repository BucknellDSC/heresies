				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>We would like to dedicate this issue of Heresies to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Ana Mendieta, who fell to her death in suspicious
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>circumstances on September 8. Ana worked on the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>collective of the ecology issue of Heresies and her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>work also appeared in &quot;Third World Issue” and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>&quot;Racism Is The Issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Born in Cuba in 1948, Mendieta was sent into exile in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>an Iowa orphanage in 1960. She became, by neces
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sity, a survivor, and once said she knew she would be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>either an artist or a criminal. Her sense of loss and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>deracination were the sources of her ongoing silueta
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>series, begun in 1973, after earlier performance-photo
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>works that were also based in her own body. This
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>obsessive, and original, series imprinted her own (or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Everywoman’s) form on and in the earth in a great
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>diversity of natural sites and materials, from flowers
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to gunpowder, from mud to grass.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In 1980, she returned to Cuba for the first time and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>became a passionate supporter of the Revolution. In
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>1981, she spent the summer there, carving increas
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ingly abstract female figures into the cliffs and caves
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of Jaruco. As her work matured, it was rapidly recog
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>nized by the art institutions. Between 1980 and 1984,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Mendieta received grants from the Guggenheim Foun
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dation, the NEA, the American Academy in Rome, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the National Awards in Visual Art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Ana lived at a certain risk, but with a fierce creative
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>appetite which is still visible in her art. Although hei
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>work contained a deep knowledge of loss and death,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>it was also a powerful force for life, and rebirth, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>revolution. A 1976 silueta was &quot;drawn&quot; against the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>night sky in fireworks, arms raised in triumph.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Ana contributed to HERESIES’ issues &quot;Third-World
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Women&quot; (8), &quot;Feminism and Ecology” (13), and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>&quot;The Great Goddess.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>called art can have a political impact and that in the making of art and all
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cultural artifacts our identities as women play a distinct role. We hope that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>theory, as well as generate new creative energies among women. It will be a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to broadening
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the definition and function of art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>HERESIES is published by a collective of feminists, some of whom are also
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists; our fields include
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>architecture, filmmaking, photography, and video. While the themes of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>individual issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>different editorial staff, composed of women who want to work on that issue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>as well as members of the collective. HERESIES provides experience for
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>women who work editorially, in design, and in production. An open evaluation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>meeting will be held after the appearance of each issue. HERESIES will try
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to be accountable to and in touch with the international feminist community
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>lives, our arts, and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>are clarified, they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>between artist and audience, and to understand the relationship between
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward the demystification of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art within the present
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because they are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>nor to the competitive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and we chose our mothers as the medium. (Men
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>would do it through jobs.) Class analysis is not just
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>about economic categorization. It has to include
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>self-image and desire. In the mythologized U.S.,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;anyone can be anything&quot;...and if you’re not what
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>you want to be, it’s your own fault. People don’t want
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to see themselves as &quot;lower class,&quot; which engenders
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>an unawareness that is precisely what keeps them
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>there where they don’t want to be.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>We were sad to conclude that none of us were
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>formed by art images; the magazines and the movies
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>were much stronger. There were few reflections of the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;lower classes&quot; there, so people had nowhere to go
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>but up. (For some, the trip was downhill all the way.)
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Ordinary work is rarely seen on TV. Archie Bunker
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was a working-class stereotype, but he wasn’t seen
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>working. Edith, now, did work, but in the house,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>because housework isn’t real work.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Our editorial process was like a collaged memoir
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>—piecing together our mothers’ lives and our own,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>finding that the resulting &quot;quilt&quot; revealed a good deal
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>about both. We had a lot of discussions within the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>collective about the connections between feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and class viewed through our own families (mostly
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>before the New Museum &quot;Big Pages” show in 1983,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>which previewed this issue). These discussions were
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>somewhere between a sewing circle and a study
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>group. We felt that most of our mothers had never
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>been recorded, that we were putting our mothers in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>history even as we bemoaned their helplessness
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>therein. I think we all felt a certain pride and a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>certain pathos. We were often led to reject our moth-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ers (or to compete with them) and to choose alternate
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>idols. Our disappointment as children when our
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>mothers turned out not to be perfect as the movie
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stars was channeled into a broader socialization
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>process controlled by the dominant culture
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Absences: We discussed a lot but received little about the ways
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>women’s class changes through marriage—up and down—and what
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>generational effects that has on people’s images of themselves. We would
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>have liked a piece comparing women’s class circumstances in several
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>cultures. (A Brazilian member of the collective notes how much more
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>stagnated the classes are in Latin America, which is true of England and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Western Europe too, though that is slowly changing.) In our meetings,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>most of our autobiographical anecdotes centered on images, clothes,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>objects and spaces. But we received nothing about spaces—about the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>kitchens many of us were raised in, the differences between large rooms
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and houses and small ones, fields and yards and apartments. And we got
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>less than we thought we would about clothes and how they reflect and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>affect power: about working jeans and designer jeans; about women who
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>dress like girls, like boys, or like men in androgynous success suits;
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>about the loose and the tight as sexy or functional; about cross-dressing
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We could have used a good psychological analysis of what is &quot;normal
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and &quot;unnatural&quot; in this society and who decides the norms. We’d
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>have liked something on children’s books and grandmothers and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>horses and...
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We were kind of appalled when we realized how many
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>submissions we received about women being (sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>literally) cut and chopped up... until we figured out that the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>real subject was the changing body image—fragmentation as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a prerequisite for transformation. There are bits of us all over
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the place. Cutting up is rebellion. We’re formed by an alien
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ated society, parts of which are severed from others by a class
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>system that is largely ignored or denied. The cutting edge, the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>political, is cut off from the personal. Racism cuts us off from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>other cultures. Cut it out. This is the cutoff point. Operation,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>penetration, incision, intersection, a cutting remark, cut the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cards, Reagan’s cutbacks for our own good, cut a new pattern,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>not trimmed down to fashionable lines.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Lights, action, cut.

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In the 1920s study Middletown, a Muncie, Indiana housewife gave this
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>account of her reading habits:
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>I just read magazines in my scraps of time. I should so like to do more consecu-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tive reading but I don’t know of any reading course or how to make one out.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>A key phrase here is the &quot;scraps of time,” the sense of fragmented lei-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sure time which characterized women’s work in the home. This woman
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was still describing her activity with magazines as &quot;reading,” but she was
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>clearly distinguishing between this form of reading and the more continu
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ous reading required of traditional literature. It won’t ever be possible to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>know exactly what she was getting from magazines; but if we are to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to comprehend the kinds of messages transmitted and the reasons for the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>medium’s enormous appeal in this century, we need to develop new meth

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>en’s magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The magazine’s use of texts implies a fairly rational mode of apprehen
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sion. It would be inaccurate, however, to describe most magazine reading
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as a straight, linear process; though often referred to as a &quot;book” by editors,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the typical magazine is not organized along a single continuum. By sand
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wiching within its covers a variety of discrete texts, the magazine invites us
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to pick and choose, to move backwards as well as forwards, in a way that
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>suggests that we not only will the process to continue by physically turning
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the pages (distinctly different from the more passive modes of radio and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>television reception) but that we &quot;freely” negotiate a &quot;personal” path through
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the magazine labyrinth.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>We do enjoy considerable freedom in determining our experience with
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>magazines, and, as the testimony of the Muncie housewife suggests, the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>flexibility of the magazine format is one of the chief reasons for its popular
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ity as a modern, mass communication form. Moreover, a regular magazine
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>reader develops a routine to avoid perpetual distraction. This technique of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;reading with blinders” is a logical response to the amount of visual diver
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sion incorporated in the modern magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The magazine forces us to discipline our focus in much the same way
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that modern highway driving cultivates split-second timing. But if we em
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ployed perfect tunnel-vision while driving, the value of billboards would be
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>nil. Any description of the highway which focused exclusively on the road
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>would fail to address the way this form of mobility allows us to achieve
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>specific destinations while constantly recharging our desire for less imme-
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>diately attainable ends. The car encloses us, the road directs us, and these
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>conditions make ads especially welcome as points of reference and as em
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>blems of our long-term goals.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>The picture magazine was refined at the same time that the commercial
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>roadscape was being developed. Both forms of communication reflect the

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tion at a national level. But unlike recent studies of car culture and &quot;the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>strip,” the magazine has rarely been studied as unified cultural artifact.

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Studies of magazines have usually treated literary texts, or edi

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>point that the women’s magazine in the twentieth century, though
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>continuing to include lengthy literary texts, was becoming a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>predominantly visual experience, constructing an audience of

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In order to understand why women’s magazines were re
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>vamped especially early in this century, we need to consider the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>impact of changes in two social spheres: that of industrial pro
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>duction and that of domestic reproduction. These spheres were
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>never wholly &quot;separate,&quot; but in this period the two became closely
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>synchronized, and women’s magazines played an important me
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>diating link in that process.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>With the late nineteenth-century emergence of monopoly cap-
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>italism, factory work changed drastically. Industrial consolida

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>be popularly associated with Henry Ford’s introduction of the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>assembly line in 1914, which allowed Ford to hire thousands of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>unskilled workers at the unprecedented rate of S5 per day. The
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>increased pay rate was easily matched by an unprecedented
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>rate of production (and profit). The justly famous output of Ford’s
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>assembly line constituted a truly massive demonstration of the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>value of efficiency.

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>efficiency had such appeal for the middle class (including fem
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>inists like Charlotte Perkins Gilman), that a variant on the dis

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>rhetoric directed at women.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>But there was a fundamental contradiction in the burgeon

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>avoided the issue of money, since they maintained the sanctity
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of women’s domestic labor as a labor of love. Without the wage

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_8_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the decline of actual managerial work and autonomy in the

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her first book on domestic efficiency, she became an associate
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>editor for the Ladies’ Home Journal, a position she held until
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the mid-1920s when she began to work free-lance, advising man

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she wrote her last book, Selling Mrs. Consumer (1929).

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>cealed) in the allocation of space within an issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Between 1914 and 1939, the ratio of advertising to editorial
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>space remained relatively constant at 45%, but there are notice
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>able changes in the distribution of advertising material during
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>this period. The front of the Journal always contained a dispro
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>portionate amount of editorial pages, a format designed to em
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>phasize the weight of editorial matter. Over twenty-five years,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the solid block of editorial material was somewhat pushed back,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>allowing more full-page ads to appear on the opening pages.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>By 1939, advertising was so culturally pervasive that it was un
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>necessary to confine it to the back pages. By 1939, Fortune was
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>a decade old and had made a trademark of its gallery of full
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>page ads at the front of each issue. In comparison with contem
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>porary magazines like Fortune and Vogue, the Journal still led
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with editorial emphasis, so that the reader was made conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>immediately of an authoritative voice which presumably organ
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ized the following contents with her best interests in mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The lines running in and out of the bar graph trace the inter

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>elsewhere in the magazine. The interruption of articles may ap
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>pear to the average reader as a commonplace if inconvenient
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>occurrence, but the resulting movement back and forth also
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>serves as a form of entrapment. Thus the reader will find it
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>considerably more difficult to confine her time and attention to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a single article. She is forced to flip through the rest of the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>magazine in order to pursue her immediate interests.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The historical evolution of a maze-like page flow is readily
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>seen here. In 1914, less than one half of the editorial space was
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>thus interwoven; the rest was allowed to stand as isolated pieces
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of text. A marked change occurred between 1914 and 1919, when
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>many more direct routes were established from the front, begin
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ing at page 7, to the middle of the magazine, though the last
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>thirty pages were not so integrated. By 1924, the constructed
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>flów began on page 3, and extended almost to the back of the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>issue, although some portions of the magazine continued as
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>isolated islands. The same held true in 1929, when a prodi

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>almost all the editorial contents was finally realized. Moreover,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the 1939 page flow was achieved with fewer large jumps; as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>indicated by only twelve external links in the chart, the flow
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>itself was more continuous. Thus, while the typical magazine
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>reader of this period may have believed that the magazine could
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>be consumed piecemeal, in &quot;scraps of time,” the diagrams re

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>At the same time that the magazine succeeded in connect-
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing almost all of its interior pages, there were considerably fewer
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>texts explicitly leading to or from earlier or later issues. While
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>this helped create a more integrated, overall text, serialization
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was not abandoned completely. By 1939, advertising literature
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stressed the desirability of newsstand sales (supposedly attract

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>most compelling for Journal readers. But it still served a strate

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The same set of graphs also reveals a major change in layous
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>within the double-page spread. As early as 1919, a marked shift
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>appeared in the placement of editorial material in relation to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ads. In 1914, between pages 60 and 99, two narrow bars of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>editorial columns floated in a sea of ads. By 1919, these col
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>umns were pushed together at the center of the double page. By
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the 1939 issue, excepting the inside cover and inside back pages,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>which commanded higher ad rates, there was some portion of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>editorial matter at the front of each double spread. Thus, over a

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>which determined these changes in layout (the art directors rarely

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>art directors between 1929 and 1939. Two covers, ten years apart,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>have an almost antithetical message. The 1929 mother-as-mature
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>flapper relies for its effect upon the state of amazement con

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>and therefore not a single ad. Moreover, the same graphs also
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>indicate that the full-page spreads and clusters of page spreads
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>which characterize the front of the magazine were replaced by
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>smaller and smaller blocks of columns towards the back, where

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>As early as the December 1911 issue, the editorial column
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>on the first page of the Journal held out the idea of a color-filled

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>for this proven method of commanding the reader’s attention.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>While the volume of color work rose most sharply between
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>1914 and 1919, the number of color pages continued to expand
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>long after the initial novelty had worn off. The editorial page of

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to keep abreast of the color craze belongs to Kodak; six years

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pages between 1934 and 1939. A body of color images was still
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>featured at the crucial begining of each issue, with smaller runs
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of color at the middle, and again at the very end of the Journal
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>—thus maintaining the image of the magazine as a luxurious
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>commodity in its own right.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>As the color page in the Depression came to represent a

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing process, we would need to study the variety of color images
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>within the extended flow of magazine material. A reading of a
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>single page is insufficient; at most it would demonstrate that

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>nication. This subject needs further study, but for now I would
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>propose that the separate but integrated codes of color and black
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and white enhanced the magazine in two, non-economic ways:
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>formally, such divisions provided a dynamic rhythm to the flow
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of the magazine; functionally, the magazine became a richer
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>vehicle for this diversity, fulfilling the consumer’s desire for both
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Truth and Beauty, and maintaining the illusion that these were
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>easily distingishable categories of experience.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Though having devoted most space to the importance of
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>changes in format and color, I must at least point out a differ
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ent type of innovation in magazine advertising of the 1930s. Not
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>only was this innovation particular to the Depression years, but
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>it signalled the limits of the magazine as a perfectly rational
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ized marketing vehicle as compared with emerging modern
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>media. Throughout this analysis, I have tried to suggest the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>strength of various graphic appeals by describing the page or
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the ad as &quot;speaking&quot; to the magazine reader. In a discussion of
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>visual effects, the expression invites charges of mixing meta
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>phors. I have used it deliberately, for the idea arguably informed
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>most of the conscious changes in the magazines; moreover, by
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the 1930s, the idea of the &quot;speaking&quot; graphic was achieved in a
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>fairly literal sense as well.

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>itself was often upstaged. A 1924 ad for laundry soap attempted
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to resolve this contradiction by replacing the standard portrait

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>as influential a source for this trend (the ad agencies after all

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Though radio competed with magazines for audiences and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>advertising money, the two media were quite complementary.

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>health was in danger, or at least our eyes, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>wanted a new one or at least one that was OK. I know
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she felt that everyone was going to benefit from
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>getting a new TV and of course she was right about
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that; we all watched 5 or 6 hours of TV a day, I mean
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>TV watching was important in 1956, but most people
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>had only one TV in a household, that TV was a kind
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of sacred object. It made us all into one people with
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>one great mind, but there were of course a couple of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>different channels. My father, I don’t know for sure,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>because I don’t see him anymore, was insensitive to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the problem I guess so I suppose my mother took an
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>action. Now, I don’t know how she came to have this
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>idea to take this action. I don’t believe she planned it,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>she was always unpredictable and more violent
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>than some of the other mothers in my neighborhood,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>what does a little kid know about that stuff anyway, I
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>must have been 7 years old. So anyway, one day in the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>morning before school, l’m sitting in front of the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>piano brushing my hair, my mother is vacuuming the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>carpet really fast and is still in her bathrobe. Sud
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>denly without any warning at all, she picks up the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>vacuum like an axe and smashes the shit out of our
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>TV. I was terrified all right. It came out of nowhere,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I thought my mother must have gone insane and of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>course since she wasn’t very pleasant in the morning,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I mean, who is? There wasn’t much explanation
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>afterwards, either, just a lot of bitter muttering. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>like she had just murdered something right in front of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>me with no thought other than to destroy. Later she
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>flushed my goldfish still alive down the toilet, but
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that was personal and l’m pretty sure it wasn’t a
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>terrorist act. Anyway, we got a slightly better TV a few
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>days later and I eventually put two and two together.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Like I said, later we got a new car sort of the same way.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I didn’t mention that my father was a policeman, he
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>drove a beautiful Porsche to work, but WE had to ride
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>in this junky old station wagon with exhaust fumes
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>pouring in, so my mother and I paid some guy to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>firebomb the car and we got her and my little sisters a
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>new one. It was beautiful, my mother really loved that
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>car. My father, after questioning us first together and
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>then separately, finally figured out that some black
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>radicals who had it out for him must have done it.

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I was watching Lili come down the stairs, my feet naked on the hallway tiles. Her

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her face to iron out the night wrinkles. When she took me in her arms, I saw the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>bulge of her breasts in the opening of her pale nylon dressing-gown.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Coming out of the kitchen, my grandmother Nancine frowned and told Lili
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>(her daughter, my mother), to tighten her robe, to try to be decent in front of her
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>child. We walked one by one along the corridor lined by high wood bookshelves,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Nancine last, holding the big enamel coated coffee pot wrapped in a wash cloth.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>She poured the coffee and the steaming milk in our bowls, set side by side on the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>oil cloth, and opened the last issue of Modes et Travaux. There was always a stack
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of magazines on a low table by the window. They were used as constant references,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and Modes et Travaux, a journal with a flair for pillow emboideries and crocheted
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N013'/>dresses, was Nancine’s bible and book of etiquette.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N014'/>With an authoritative finger she leafed through the pages of the magazine. She

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>She oozed with pleasure and anticipation.

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>MARIE-CLAIRE — July 1966. The skirts are all cut above the knee, the

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>mouths, white with a touch of mauve.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>&quot;Isn’t it smart with the white blouse underneath
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>When Nancine spoke she smacked her tongue, savoring each syllable like a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>rosary, bead by bead, squeezing the last word in her throat as if swallowing our
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>gaze and our attention at the same time.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Grudgingly I approved the suit, blew a docile yes. Lili sniffed, wiping her
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mouth with the back of her hand, stretching her neck to see the model.

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sound. Nancine gave her a cold look, her pale eyes narrowing
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the irises crouched under her thick brow like two little fero

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_14_1_tl_3' n='N012'/>was pointing to a navy-blue schoolgirl’s dress with a round col

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N012'/>in a cloud of acrid smelling lacquer that caked the hair hard
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N013'/>but guaranteed a perfect hold against winds and kisses.

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N015'/>Let me see? Hmm. Not bad.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N016'/>I had not moved from the mirror. I was too busy trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N017'/>roll between thumb and finger a lock that was supposed to

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N019'/>ELLE—October 1966. “In America they don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N020'/>speak of love anymore, but of sex.” The pictures
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N021'/>show young Americans with their hair cut in bangs
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N022'/>like the Beatles and wearing blue jeans, the girls
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N023'/>with knee-high socks. Someone claims: “Virgin
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N024'/>ity is dead. Nancy Sinatra’s song: “These boots
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N025'/>are made for walking’ is a hit in France...
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N026'/>Lili laughed
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N027'/>’You’re not listening to me. You didn’t even see what I was

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N029'/>We both sat on the unmade bed. I felt her warm thigh through
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N030'/>her robe. We were bent over photos of stretched calves, low
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N031'/>necked blouses revealing small breasts, enchanting smiles.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N032'/>I like that one.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N033'/>It was a dress in purple wool, cut above the knee, a belt tied
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N034'/>around the hips.

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N036'/>—There is a full page photograph of Juliette
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N037'/>Greco, the existentialists’ idol from the fifties. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N038'/>words have a sneer that you don’t see in the pic
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N039'/>ture. She says: “My work is abnormal. It’s a man&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N040'/>work. It is not my role.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N041'/>I was having breakfast at the kitchen table, pouring over the

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N043'/>ment, an armful of freshly clean laundry held tight against her
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N044'/>chest. She leant over my shoulder. &quot;What are you reading again!
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N045'/>When I think that you have studied Latin and Greek! It’s these

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Jemima Blakey (fig. A) didn’t come from no ordinary people. Her Granma and Granpa
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>bought they freedom out a slavery in New Orleans. Granma Jemima Blakey—they
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>called her Aunt Jemima too—made cakes and catered fine parties for them plantation
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>owners in Louisiana. And Granpa Blakey was a first-class tailor too. From memory he
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>could make a suit of clothes fit like a glove. They was sure smart people, them Blakeys.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>And Jemima was just like ’em, hard-working, and God-fearing till the day she died.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Jemima could do anything she set her mind to. When Ma Tillie (fig. B) and Pa
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Blakey (fig. C), Jemima’s Ma and Pa, forbid her to marry Big Rufus Cook (fig. D) on
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>account a they wanted her to marry a preacher. Jemima up and married Big Rufus
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>anyway, and they run off to Tampa, Florida to work for Ole Man and Ole Lady Prophet
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>(figs. E, F) cookin, cleanin and takin care a they chirrun somethin Jemima never had to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>do livin in her Ma and Pa’s comfortable home in New Orleans.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Ole Man Prophet used to joke that Jemima was his heir. &quot;Jemima keep my house
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and family like they hers. I reckon l’II leave ’em to her when I die,&quot; he used to tell Ole
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Lady Prophet. &quot;Over my dead body” she used to say. Well as God would have it,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>lightening struck they house one night whilst the servants was away and burnt it to the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ground. Ain nar’ a one of them Prophets survive. And, praise God, she was.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Jemima &amp; Big Rufus was rich now. They come to New York with they chirrun Geor
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>gia (fig. G) and Lil Rufus (fig. H) and opened a restaurant and catering business in
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Harlem.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Big Rufus was a fine chef too, and could tailor clothes out this world just like
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Granpa Blakey. He looked like white, and couldn’t see nobody but Jemima, black as
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>she was. No—never did. “Where you get that fine-looking man from Jemima?” folks
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>used to ask her. &quot;Where I get you from asking me that question?” she’d say, laughing.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Now Lil Rufus, Jemima’s baby, handsome as a Greek god, took color after Jemima’s
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>side a the family. Jemima likena died when he married a white gal, name a Margo (fig.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I) he picked up in Germany, of all places, during that Korean War. Brought her home
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>too, to live in Jemima’s house in Harlem. They had three girls: Jemmie (fig. J), JoAnn
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>(fig. K) and Julia (fig. L). They look just like Jemima. They ain look nothin like they Ma,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Margo, she a scrawny little ole white gal. Love the ground Lil Rufus walk on.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Georgia, Jemima’s daughter, was high yaller likena her pa, Big Rufus, and had
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>green eyes and long straight hair she could sit on. Only thing she took after Jemima
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>was her shape. Georgia was real big up top and had skinny legs and big feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Jemima’d blow up like a balloon when folks say&apos;d she was Georgia’s maid. Georgia’d
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>laugh and call her ma Aunt Jemima. Jemima’d take that piss tail gal over her knee and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>whoop her till she quit. &quot;You ain no more’n your ma,” Jemima’d tell her, and Georgia’d
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>screw up her lil’ horse face an holler.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Jemima was some proud at Georgia’s wedding to Dr. Jones (fig. M). But Ma Tillie
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>said, “Jemima, that’s a evil ole ugly black man, you’ll see.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Tillie Blakey, Jemima’s Ma, was half Indian. A real beauty in her youth, she was
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>coal black with long braids and keen features. They say she ran a bad house for white
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>men in New Orleans. All’s I know she was a good church-going woman owned a fine
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>house and left plenty money to the church when she died. Pa Blakey called it penance
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>money from the devil. He swore he’d never touch it. Much as he loved Georgia and her
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>struggling doctor husband, and they two chirrun Peter (fig. N) and Annabelle (fig. O),
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>he never give em a cent of Ma Tillie’s money.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>After Pa Blakey died, Jemima and Big Rufus give they restaurant business in Har-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>lem to Lil Rufus and his German wife Margo, and moved to New Orleans. There they
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>opened another restaurant near Georgia’s house.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>But Jemima ain never see her grand chirrun, Peter and Annabelle. &quot;My Pa don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>want you in our house,&quot; they told her one day. And then Peter kicked Jemima in her bad
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>knee and he and Annabelle ran off. The next day before Dr. Jones could leave for his
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>office, Lil Rufus was there, and he was mad as hell. When Dr. Jones saw him, he
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>jumped in the pool fully dressed, bag an all.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>That same morning Jemima and Big Rufus had a fatal car accident on the way to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>open they restaurant. God rest they souls. Lil Rufus brought they bodies back to Har
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>lem, and give ’em an African funeral—Praise God! Dressed Jemima in an African
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>gown and braided her hair with cowrie shells. Put Big Rufus in a gold dashiki. They
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>looked nice though, peaceful, like they was home.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Georgia, her doctor husband, and them two worthless chirrun a hers got Jemima’s
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>restaurant business and Ma Tillie’s big fine house in New Orleans. Now, who’s afraid
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>of Aunt Jemima?

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Before I was married, I worked in an ice-cream store in Highland
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Falls. I was lucky to get the job. It helped: the extra money. My
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>father had retired. He had arthritis so bad and couldn’t work. I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>worked in the ice-cream store all through high school. I had
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>every intention of being a nurse then, but money was hard to come
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>by. My mother said that if I wanted to go to college and be a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>nurse, I would have to go out and make the money for it, but
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>working in an ice-cream store I wasn’t making that much. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I met my husband and being a nurse, why, that went down
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the drain!
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>We went together for a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>year and a half before we
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>were married. I had three
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>children. I had no intention
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>of going to work after I was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>married. I was quite content
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>being at home. I always
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>liked the idea of keeping a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>home and it&apos;s more or less
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>a tradition for the women in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>my family to be homemak-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>ers. My mother never worked
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>outside the house when we
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>were growing up, only
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>when my father retired and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>couldn’t provide anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>My daughter is a homemak-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>er and my son&apos;s wife is
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>another one that likes to stay
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>home with the kids. My
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>youngest sister is the only
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>one that works. I don’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>how she can do it, day in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>and day out for so many

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>My husband is of the idea
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>that a woman belongs in the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>home. Whenever I would
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>say that I would like to get a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>job, he would say, &quot;You’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>got enough to do here.&quot; He
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>never really liked the idea of me going out. I think he used to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>feel that people would think he couldn’t support me. I used to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>feel guilty about not going out to work. I don’t anymore. All of a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>sudden there was this big surge: everybody was going out to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>work. Someone would say, &quot;Oh, you don’t work?&quot;” and eyebrows
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>would go up. But I enjoy being at home. I always got a pleasure
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>in washing and ironing and seeing things clean.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>You still have some people who think: &quot;Well, what do you do all
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>day, you don’t go out to business?” They think you don’t do
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>anything, but you get involved in a lot of other things. When a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>neighbor calls and says she needs you, you drop everything
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>and go. I was involved in a lot of volunteer work when the kids
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>were growing up.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N055'/>If I had to go out to work right now, I really don’t know what I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N056'/>would do. I don’t know if my volunteer work would put me in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N057'/>any particular job; maybe a salesgirl, I don’t know. Most of my
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N058'/>friends are homemakers and I haven’t noticed a lot of them
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N059'/>going back to work. The big change has been with the younger
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>generation. My generation, we would think twice about going
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>out to work. Well, there probably wasn’t as great a need as now,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with the price of food and everything, but when I was first
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>married, I didn’t expect a house right away and all the new
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>furniture. I think young people now, they want a home right
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>away and all new furniture, two cars, the latest thing: everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>It took a long time to get that in our generation. The war was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>over there was a lot more money around. So, maybe it was the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>way they were brought up. You have to admire them in a way.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>But in another way, I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>admire that you have to have
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>everything right away. If you
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>have it all, what have you to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>look forward to? I think
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that’s why theyre more mis-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>content. It’s probably our
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>generation that did it to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>them so they can’t help it!
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>During the war, so many
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women went out to work.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Sometimes they took over
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>men’s jobs because the men
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>weren’t there. I think it all
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>led to this &quot;women&apos;s lib&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>stuff, if that&apos;s what you want
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to call it. You know, I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>blame them in a lot of ways,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wanting to get paid if theyre
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>doing an equal job. A lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>it I don’t agree with, a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>it I don’t even pay attention
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to, but, I think that if a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>woman does a good job
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>equal to a man’s job, she
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>should get paid as much. I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>don’t see wanting the re
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sponsibility of being over a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lot of men: l’m sure they
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>must resent it. I wouldn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>want to do it myself. Well,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>everybodys different. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>women have that drive to get to the top.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Now, I do think that men put women down. It’s just an attitude;
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>I can’t put my finger on it, but you sense it. l’m sure it has
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>changed some. It’s bound to. The women are changing it with
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>all their drives and meetings and such. Not being out in the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>business world, I wouldn’t experience that change much though.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>But, I think that if women have children, they lose a lot when
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>they go out to work. I can remember my kids used to say, &quot;Boy,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Mom, it’s good to come in. You can smell something cooking
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and know you’re here.&quot; If women really feel that they want to get
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>out of the house and do something, if it makes them happy
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>—fine! Maybe they figure they want everything right away instead
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>of waiting and saving for it the way we had to do. But, I think
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>there’s a lot of women who go out to business who would rather
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>be home. Sometimes it’s a necessity, but sometimes, let’s face
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>it, some women are just not made to be homemakers.

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I have always made five goals for what I wanted to do in my life.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I wanted to get married and have children. I always loved
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>make-up and hair-cutting; I wanted to work as a cosmetologist
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in some kind of make-up field. I wanted to go to college and be
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a nurse and I wanted to go to college to write a book. l’ve only
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>nursing and my book left, which l’ve started to write. l’ve just
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>turned the age where the book will be about my past: my
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>teenagehood.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N009'/>l’m twenty years old. I have two daughters, one four and one
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N010'/>who is six months old. I was fifteen when I left high school and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N011'/>was married. I was in school three weeks of my tenth grade year
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N012'/>and I had gotten pregnant. My parents told me it was my decision
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N013'/>what I wanted to do. My boyfriend was nineteen-at the time and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N014'/>working. He said, &quot;I want to get married. We can make it work.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N015'/>We did and here I am and that’s that!
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N016'/>My husband’s a really homebound person. He’s the father type
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N017'/>person. He runs my whole house. When I was seventeen he
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N018'/>bought me a house for our
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N019'/>second anniversary. He
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N020'/>comes home from work,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N021'/>expects his dinner, his home
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N022'/>spotless, his children wait
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N023'/>ing for him. He’Il say &quot;Fran,
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N024'/>Ireally don’t want you to do
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N025'/>this.&quot; or &quot;I don’t want you
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N026'/>to do that.&quot; or &quot;You’re
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N027'/>pushing yourself too hard.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N028'/>But he would never give me
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N029'/>a direct, &quot;No, you can’t do
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N030'/>this.&quot; We sit and talk a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N031'/>and it&apos;s &quot;Will you help me?
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N032'/>I need your help.&quot; That type
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N033'/>of thing. He watches my
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N034'/>children whenever I have
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N035'/>things to do and he&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N036'/>rebuilding my house now.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N037'/>It&apos;s our house but it&apos;s more
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N038'/>mine because l’m always in
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N039'/>it. I take care of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N040'/>My husband’s a mechanic
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N041'/>at J.C.Penneys up in Mid
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N042'/>dletown. He wants to open
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N043'/>his own business, maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N044'/>go into a family type deal
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N045'/>because his brother does
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N046'/>all the auto body and my
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N047'/>husband does everything
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N048'/>from rebuilding cars to... everything! They want to open up a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N049'/>shop and I would take care of the books. I told him, &quot;I can
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N050'/>handle all your books. My mother’s an accountant. She could
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N051'/>show me.&quot; I would help him as far as that goes, but l’m not the
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N052'/>kind of person who would hang around there. I said, &quot;TII pick
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N053'/>up the books, but it’s your business. I’II just help you.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N054'/>My mother’s very young; she married very young. My sister’s 21
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N055'/>and l’m 20 and the three of us have a good time when we go out.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N056'/>We do things together. People can’t believe that we’re mother
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N057'/>and daughters and when they hear that there are grandchildren
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N058'/>—it completely blows their minds! My mother’s a public
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N059'/>accountant for a public relations firm. She controls a whole
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N060'/>office. My father lives in Florida. He’s an auto mechanic. He
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N061'/>owns his own business. My parents got divorced when I was
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N062'/>10. Under the circumstances, we didn’t see him after that. I
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N063'/>guess the problem was that my father was just an auto
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N064'/>mechanic and my mother was working in a big company. She
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N065'/>would have to go to these big conventions and things. He
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N066'/>couldn’t relate to them. He never wanted her to work, whether
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>they needed the extra money or not. He knew she was going up
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and he was at a standstill. She’s worked for her company for
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>years, ever since she was old enough to get in there. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a hard worker. She picked things up pretty quick. She read a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>lot of books. Her biggest dream in life was to be Somebody and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to make good money. She did and she wasn’t going to let any
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>thing stand in her way because she knew she could do it.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N008'/>My mother-in-law is homebound. If my father-in-law can’t earn
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N009'/>it, they do without because he’s the Man-of-the-House. She
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N010'/>goes right along with it. She’d like me to stay home. That’s how
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N011'/>they believe: a woman should not work. It’s weird; they’re just
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N012'/>different people with different beliefs. I tell them, &quot;When I have
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N013'/>this big beautiful house and me and Kenny have a lot of money
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N014'/>because we’ve worked at it together....&quot; they look at me like l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N015'/>a nut! They say that everything I want, I don’t care what I have
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N016'/>to do, I get it. That’s just how I am! I will WORK for something!
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N017'/>I don’t believe in going to W.T.Grants to buy clothes, that type
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N018'/>of stuff. l’m different. I guess because I wasn’t brought up on
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N019'/>that. I took my first daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N020'/>to buy a coat. It was about
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N021'/>S55. I liked the coat, and
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N022'/>you know, you get what you
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N023'/>pay for. Well, they thought I
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N024'/>was sick! I said, &quot;But it&apos;s a
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N025'/>good coat; she’ll stay warm.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N026'/>They said, &quot;She doesn’t need
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N027'/>that; buy her something
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N028'/>cheaper.&quot; I can’t do that.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N029'/>Right now, I deal with Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N030'/>Kay Cosmetics. I hold skin
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N031'/>care classes and offer pri

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N033'/>love it! I learned about Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N034'/>Kay when I was going to

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N039'/>really wanted to do. You

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N041'/>do it. You work your time

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N043'/>is nice; not too many jobs

				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N048'/>to be involved with their own needs. My needs are just fulfilling
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N049'/>myself. I have a baby 6 months old. As soon as she starts
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N050'/>school, I will attend college for nursing. It’s something that I
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N051'/>would like to know, just for the knowledge of it. It’s self-
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N052'/>fulfilling for me. I don’t even know if I would stop at nursing;
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N053'/>maybe I would move on to a doctor or something. I don’t know!
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N054'/>I’m young. I have a long time to fullfill everything that I really
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N055'/>want to do. l’m very prepared for anything. I know I can do
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N056'/>anything. I plan my whole day. I get up at 5:30, get my
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N057'/>husband’s breakfast, get his shower ready, get my husband up.
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N058'/>Kids get up, I feed them, take care of them. My housework&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N059'/>done. By 9:00 I go and do what I have to do, take care of
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N060'/>business, and by 4:00 I know it’s time to go home and cook: we
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N061'/>eat when he comes home. If I have a show to do, it’s usually
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N062'/>around 8:00. Finally, the kids are in bed by 7:00 and we can
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N063'/>relax. I have a little bit of time to talk with him, then I go do
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N064'/>what I have to do. I come home at a reasonable time and go to
				<lb facs='#facs_27_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N065'/>bed and get up the next day and start all over again. I have

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>l’Il be 40 May 10th, if I live to see it. I left Virginia when I was 4
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and went to school in Newburgh, N.Y. I stopped in 10th grade
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>’cause my mother had too many kids in school and she said she
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>couldn’t give me the type of clothes like a high-school girl
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>should have. My father had 21 children. There’s 18 of us living,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>but he’s been married three times. Only my mother’s kids were
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>living at home. She had 12.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>I was the oldest girl, yeah.... listen, I had to give them their
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>bath, make sure they got their homework. I had to get up at
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>5AM to get breakfast ready, then I had to pack their lunches
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and get the kids out to school. Then I had to go to work at
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Dupex Bags. I was only making $30 a week but I had to turn
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>over half of that every time. I remember one time I talked back
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to Daddy ’cause he told me to give my mother one half and him
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the other half. I told him, &quot;Well, it’s no use me working.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>My father worked in a junkyard down by the Hudson River. I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>never had no life at home, really, because: well, my father used
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to make me take all my
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>clothes off and he&apos;d whip
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>me with switches he got
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>down at the river. I called
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>them tree branches ’cause
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>that’s what they seemed like
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>to me. I was striped like a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tiger all the way up and I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was just coming into wo-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>manhood—June apples—I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>have much more than that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>now. I was bloody every-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>where he hit me: nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>but welts.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>One time I had to stay
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>home from high school for
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>two weeks ’cause he slapped
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>me and all five fingers was
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>on my face. I asked my
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>mother if he was my real
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>father. I got to the point
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>where I threatened to com
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>mit suicide. I was gonna
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>take any pill I saw lying
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>around. Finally, I called
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Family Services and my
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>mother agreed to let me live
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>with my godmother. When
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the cops came to pick me
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>up, Daddy pulled a gun on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>them. He said, &quot;Nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>tells me how to raise my kids!&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>I think about my father a lot. I think the reason I don’t have any
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>kids is that he could have damaged my female organs. I said on
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>many days that l’Il be glad when he dies and, you’d better be
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>lieve, when he died I really didn’t take it too hard.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Anyway, when I was 16 I went to live with my godmother in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Pennsylvania. I had a janitor’s job at Westinghouse. I had to lift
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>those heavy buckets and those mops and stuff—I wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>supposed to be doing that kind of work. I have syncopy so I get
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>seizures and dizzy spells. The doctor told me they come from
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>anxiety. After 6 or 8 months at Westinghouse I was terminated.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Every job l’ve ever had, I was terminated.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>When I was in Pennsylvania, I paid §20 and I took a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>high-school test. It took three nights. Some of the girls who
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>took it had just got out of school and they missed by more
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>points than I did. I was really amazed at myself, ’cause I only
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>missed it by 12 points. l’m gonna take another one if welfare
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>pays for it.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I was 24 when I got married, but I never had no life with my
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>husband, really. He first started me drinking. We separated after
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>20 years and that was one of the reasons. I mean, it’s all very in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>teresting, the things people tell what they do under the influence
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of alcohol. It’s really ridiculous: they get in jail and then they don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>remember nothing about it. I ain’t never been that far to extremes.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I used to go to the mental health clinic. The doctor knows more
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>than I do. He seemed to think that I didn’t need to come there
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>anymore, so I didn’t go back. I guess he just got tired.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Right now, l’m not working, and, let me tell you, the welfare in
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Newburgh is really nasty. I want to work, but I can’t go working
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in places for six months and then get sick and welfare knows
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that. I get to thinking about how I didn’t get no education. l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>not hard to catch on to things, but what can I do? Every job you
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>see in the papers you need experience, but if you don’t have the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>training you don’t get the experience. The only work I do now is
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>when my uncle moves stuff—sometimes he asks me to help
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>him. There’s something about it I don’t like, but it keeps me
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>from staying in the house
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>all day, looking at the win
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>dows and the walls. I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>much more relaxed. Right
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>now, l’m waiting to hear to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>get on SSI. I sit here worry-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ing every day, watching for
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the mailman. I’m scared
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>somebody will steal my
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>mail.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>’Course, I never go no
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>place unless it’s shopping,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to the wash, or something. I

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>thing that&apos;s in me now that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>don’t bother about going
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>nowhere. Since I started
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>attending A.A. meetings it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>really good, but the meet
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ings didn’t start till 9 pm,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>so Miss Taylor started hav
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ing them at noon. I asked
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>her to ’cause I get scared a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lot of the time, walking at
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>night by myself. When I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>was 24, I got raped and that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>is something l’II never get
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>over. The judge—and he
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ain&apos;t nothing either—he
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>says, &quot;All you had to do
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>was cross your legs and he
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>couldn’t have raped you.” But the man was very violent. He
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>pulled me into the car and wrang my wrists and stuff. I couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>get out of the car ’cause he didn’t stop at no red lights. I looked
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>around for something to hit him with in the car, but I couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>find nothing. It was a terrible experience. When I got home, I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>called the police. A detective came and made me get out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>bathtub so I could identify the man. We had to put so much
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>pressure on the judge, but finally they locked him up, after me
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and my sister went to the pastor and got some aid from him and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>some of his members. For about four years I felt very unclean,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>no matter how much I washed.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>As far as life goes, I didn’t have too much, but I was always
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>the type of person to help people; I really like to do that. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>have many visitors. If Miss Taylor at the A.A. had a bigger
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>place, maybe I could meet more people, but very seldom do I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>see another woman there. I tried to get one of my girlfriends to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>go but she didn’t give a damn one way or another. If we had a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>bigger place, Miss Taylor said, we could help kids to plant
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>seeds, or somebody could teach sewing or whatever they know.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>But what are we going to do now? We barely have room to walk.

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I was very fortunate because my mother and my aunt were both
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>singers and my grandfather was a ballroom dancer, so they
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>started my training very early: when I was about four. I went to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Professor O’Brien’s Normal School of Dancing. It was 6 days a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>week. We had Interpretive on Monday, Egyptian on Tuesday,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Spanish on Wednesday, acrobatics on Thursday tap on Friday
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and ballet on Saturday. It was a very rich and very esoteric
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>education because the teacher was very classical. We all wore
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tunics and on Egyptian night we came out of mummy cages. I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>went there during my most formative years: 5 years with Professor
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>O’Brien and his wife at the piano.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Nobody said anything about a career, but I performed at an

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ten years professionally after that. She loved jazz, so it was her
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>influence that got me into it. She was a very soulful person. Of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>course, my father worked 16 hours a day and was never home,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>so that I could get such a good education. He was a very dog
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>matic Italian father. Yet, even though he was very old-fashioned,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>it was always as if I were ex
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>pected to be independent. It
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>was never any question of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>saying: &quot;Well, when you
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>grow up you’ll get married
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and you won’t need all this.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The tradition of the females
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>in my family was very
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>strong: they were all work-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ers. However, nobody ever
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>wants their son or daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to go into show business,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>even if theyre in it them
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>selves. Theyre always hop-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ing you&apos;ll turn into an
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>historian or something, sol
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>was never guided.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Iwas 15 when my parents
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>got divorced. I was going to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Alice Duffys, who had a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>very typical dance school
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>—much more expensive,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>but very good! My mother&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>agent came to one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>recitals and said, &quot;She&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>had enough of this teacher.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>He sent me to Stanley
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Brown’s in Boston. I would
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>go into Boston to study
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>every day after school. I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>never got much of an educa
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>tion, obviously, of any intellectual type. I mean, I was 15 in
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Boston, hanging around—I was fortunate enough to meet a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>group of college people. We would go and talk in Hayes and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Bickfords and they kinda accepted me as a mascot—a kooky
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>mascot with dyed red hair and black eyes: the odd one. So I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>was getting educated.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>By the time I was married, I already had a thorough education
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>in dance and music, not an intellectual one, but in those days
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>people didn’t talk about dance like they do now. If you had
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>talent, you did it.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Dance is so strenuous, it’s so hard, that I didn’t feel much
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>competition with men or much argument until I was married
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>In fact, other than the sexual problem of being pursued everytime
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>I turned around, I wouldn’t say that I was influenced or tied up
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>in the whole thing of feeling female, or what that meant or that I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>had problems. I would have a hell of a lot of problems when I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>would go into a producer’s or director’s office. That was awful!
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>That was a nightmare! And continually a nightmare! I would
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>become evil! Evil! And the more evil I got, the more lecherous
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>they got! Some gals have wonderful techniques that I learned
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>too late, of complete ingenuousness and naivete. Even though
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>they might be the raunchiest people in the world, when they
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>walked in there they didn’t know a thing. l’d go in there and l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>say &quot;OK baby, I dare ya! Go ahead!&quot; Well, needless to say, they
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>did! That was terrible! In those days I was very voluptuous. I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>looked like they should come on to me. It’s very unfortunate
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that your physical type should demand that kind of response. It
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was appalling, humiliating and awful.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I was afraid of the hard shell I needed to form, the ag
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>gressiveness, but I was also afraid of being made into something
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I wasn’t. I mean, when you’re in this business, you’re a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>commodity. I had managers that would decide who I would be.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>One manager had the idea that would be a combination of Carol
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Channing, Marcel Marceau and Charlie Chaplin. I got sent to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the hairdressers and I got dressed a certain way, had to go out
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with certain people and couldn’t hang out in the jazz joints that
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I always did. I got a contract to sign for MGM, but I was supposed
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to play, you know, tootsies under the table before I could sign
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the contract. I became a very distorted creature. It was a desper
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ateness and a real desolat
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>edness and I wasn’t an ex
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>pert at taking care of myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I lived too hard.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I never wanted to get
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>married. I never saw myself
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>in that position. My career
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>had really been snowball
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ing, but it also had a tre
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mendous amount of hard
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>knocks: it was a very vicious
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>profession. I was getting a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>little evil and paranoid and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I didn’t like myself too
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>much. I was at a low ebb. A
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>man came along and said,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>&quot;TII take care of you, be
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>cause if I don’t, you’ll die.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Well, I believed it!
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>He was an artist, a paint
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>er. We had children right
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>away and moved to the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>country, and led a very crea
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tive life. Four years after I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>got married, I went back to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>dancing under great duress.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>It was never really possible
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to dance when I was mar-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ried. I would get terrible
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>migraines because the has
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>sle at home was so great. I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>did start working with a composer, doing avant-garde things. I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>enjoyed what I did with him very much. We did some good
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>work, but I wasn’t having a career. I was home with my children,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>farming, loading manure, feeding the pigs and watching my
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>husband paint. He really made a point that I couldn’t bring
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>money into the house. I’d make §25 and he’d say, &quot;Well, I can
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>make S25 in five minutes. It takes you three days, so why bother!&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>I didn’t think that, well, l’m making that now, later l’II make a lit-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>tle more. I accepted that small position, saying that it’s true. Yet,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>we led a very interesting life—insulated but interesting. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>resent it for a minute. I think I would have, if, when we got di
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>vorced, I hadn’t had all those years of training and found myself
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>with nothing. I did have my career before. I had something!
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>I never in my wildest dreams thought of picking up my career
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>again, or ever thought I wasn’t at the end of it. I was 34—35,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>that, for a dancer is old. The things that have opened up and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>what life has taught me since, have shocked me so much I still
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>can’t believe it! I finally feel strong enough to deal with that
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>push-pull foxtrot affair with success. I wouldn’t be gobbled up.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>I do feel that my time has come. l’m definitely on that plane.

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>When I was born, Maury who in her

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>motherly love the lowest form of animal
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>instinct,&quot; discovered something unex

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>been her Savior as well as her Messiah.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>But, then, I could, at least, become
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>what she had had neither the strength
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>nor the opportunity to be. What that is
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>exactly, I don’t now, but I do know that
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>it is not what I am. I should have been
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>something else, should have achieved
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the &quot;real life” that she had missed.
				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_16_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>We were very close, Maury and I,

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>when
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I was an
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>infant. She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>valued culture
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and verbal intelli
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>gence, so she taught
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>me to read and write be
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>fore other children. She
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>talked to me as one adult
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to another, instead of feed
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing me baby-talk. She gave
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>me the tools of my future
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>development—my verbal
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>skills, the very possibility of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>becoming an &quot;intellectual
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and a writer. What she had not
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>bargained for was that one day
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I would use these skills for pur
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>poses other than those she had
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>envisioned, and she must have felt
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_12_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>completely betrayed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>My betrayal began on that sunny
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>afternoon in the cemetery. I only realized
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>it ten years later, when I finally talked
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to my father. But I betrayed her that day
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>by not fully understanding what she
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>meant to say.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I loved Maury passionately, more than
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>I loved my remote and absent father.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>After his death, Maury told me that she
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>had been &quot;alone all her life&quot;, adding,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with her typical mauvaise foi, &quot;except
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>when your father was alive.&quot; This was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>untrue. Maury was a loner, striving for
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_13_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a closeness with other human beings
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>she would not attain. She mistook the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ecstatic experience of her first baby for
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>such a closeness. She envisioned a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>world where the half-said would be
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>fully understood. Instead, that after
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>noon on the cemetery, she entered a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>world of deception.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>So she was talking to me with com
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>plete seriousness. She was putting her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>life story in my hands, as well as the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>story of three generations of women.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>She said she was partially Jewish on
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>her mother&apos;s side. But that I should not
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>repeat it. Especially not in front of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Daddy. Because it would not please
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>him.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>While the rest of that afternoon has
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>more or less crumbled to dust, I have
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>not forgotten those words. And like a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cabbalist, I will probably spend the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>rest of my life deciphering them. For, as
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>events were to prove, I must have mis
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>understood something. I too was im
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>prisoned by a conception of human
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>relationships based on total closeness,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>total transparency. I could not imagine,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>for example, that my father was igno
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>rant of the &quot;secret&quot; with which I had
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>just been entrusted. I thought he must
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>know, but did not want it repeated.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Why he wouldn’t want anyone else to
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>know was a mystery to me. I may have
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>mistaken this &quot;secret&quot; for some kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>primal scene&quot;—a knowledge shared
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>by my parents alone, which I could
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>now share, thanks to my
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>mother’&apos;s generosity and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_14_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>confidence in me.

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Nearly ten years later, fed up with the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>monotonous repetition of my fathers
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>antisemitism, I finally told him that his
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>statements were in very poor taste, con
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sidering that without a certain Jewish

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Jesus Christ! I was thinking of Marx
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Lazare, Maury&apos;s great grandfather, who
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>had arrived from Germany around 1840
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I brushed away my fathers pitiful argu

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>since he was the son of God.. Imen
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tioned Marx Lazare, I thought my father
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>was upset to discover that I knew. In
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>fact, he may very well have been uj
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to discover the fact itself. I never founc
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>out. I left home at seventeen after a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>terrible argument with him, and saw
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>him only occasionally until his death ir
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>1973. He was very fond of me, but we
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>never managed to talk.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>Maury was born in a small French
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>town of 800 inhabitants. Her father, a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>surveyor, belonged to the local petty
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>gentry. The landowners would invite
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>him to hunting parties, but he did not

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>Marcell, nee Lazare, was born inside
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>the brush factory built by her grandfa
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>ther, Marx Lazare. He seems to have
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>been a shrewd businessman. Readings
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>and research in the history of female
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>labor during the Industrial Revolution
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>helped me figure out why he had cho

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>peasant community. Women working in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>urban centers were indeed cheap, but
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>you still had to pay them enough so
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>that they could buy food at city prices.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>In the country, you had even cheaper
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>labor —the clean, unsophisticated and

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>the local farm laborers, who lived at

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>gardens. It was a goldmine for a gifted
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>entrepreneur who then marketed the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>products in Paris—only 80 miles away
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>Since my mother had forbidden me to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N051'/>ever mention her Jewishness again,I
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>have difficulty in reconstructing Marx
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>Lazare&apos;s life. I saw only one photo of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>him—a tall black-bearded, imposing
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N055'/>man with piercing eyes. That afternoon
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N056'/>at the cemetery, Maury had described
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N057'/>him as a free thinker, &quot;which was very
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N058'/>fashionable at the time.&quot; (For her, lack
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N059'/>of religious feeling was a cardinal sin)
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N060'/>Being &quot;enlightened,&quot; he may have be
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N061'/>longed to the German Jewish bourgeoi

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N063'/>where he came from. The only certainty
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N064'/>is that he married a local peasant girl
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N065'/>and had two sons. Maurice inherited
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N066'/>the factory and married another gentile
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N067'/>woman. He died of tuberculosis at 30,

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>only child, was four. She was never sent
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to school but educated at home by pri

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and her mother&apos;s grandmother—a very
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>devout Catholic. Marcelle remembered
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>being afraid of Marx Lazare when she
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was little because he told her, &quot;Your

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>telling you lies, you know.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>At 19, an impoverished Marcelle
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>passed an exam to become a postal
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>clerk, but was rescued by Emile Car
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tier’s courtship. They were married
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>shortly before World War I; she became
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>pregnant immediately with my mother,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and had two boys shortly after. Maury
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>grew up poor and respectable. She went
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to the village school, and later was sent
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to a Catholic boarding school nearby,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>where her schoolmates were of a very

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>of the oldest form of capital in France;
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>not stocks, bonds and factories, but
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>arable land, cattle, fields and forests,

				<lb facs='#facs_32_l_2340' n='N009'/>Later, when Maury could

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to her marriage, she insisted
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>on spending every possible

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Maury’s genuine love for the land
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was reinforced by a burning desire to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>find &quot;roots&quot; in an ancient and venerable

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>political history. She got involved in

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>So her husband, too, was of peasant

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in 1890. The third of seven children, she was in the words
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of her mother, &quot;happy, good, open-hearted, without whim,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>but with a sense and seriousness beyond her years, and

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The fan mags of the 1940s claimed to Tell All about the stars

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>For publishers, the supreme function of fan magazines was

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>famous. Then it was burned to the ground. Now it is being rebuilt. You are lucky to
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>come here. You are at a certain height to allow you to work in the sawmill safely. When
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the other workers swing the lumber around, you are short enough for the lumber to
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pass over your head without hitting you. This makes the whole operation much more
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>efficient; you are required to run around with a clipboard showing people various
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>orders and designs. There is flat cutting at this mill; there is chopping and laminating
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and pressing. There is also a woodworking shop where they receive orders for various
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cut-out shapes. The only problem with this job is that you keep growing, so everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>has to be careful. They are liable for anything that might happen to you: cuts, slips,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>bangs on the head. So they measure you every week.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Every week a mustachioed foreman comes out with a steel tape measure, sticks it
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>up your spine and hooks it on top of your head.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;You’re O.K.,&quot; he laughs, and pats your behind. You run off with another order.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The small town grows. There are many orders; everyone works very hard at
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the mill.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>One day an order comes in from a new burlesque house in town. They want a sign.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>You take the order to the woodworking shop because this is a complicated design: the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>figure of a woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>You’re in the shop. Nobody knows how to do the figure of a woman. Everyone is
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>scratching their heads and pulling their mustaches. They draw various figures on the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>boards; then erase all of them. Finally, you’re still hanging around intrigued by all
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>this; they notice you. First, they laugh; then they ask you to turn around.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>&quot;O.K.,&quot; says the foreman, &quot;We can’t lose. Let’s try it.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>They make you lie down on a 4 X 8’ board. Then one guy stands over you with a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>pencil and draws around the edges of your body. When they finish, it looks like a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>gingerbread man. So they start all over and make you lie down sideways. Fetal position
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>stretched out. They draw around you, pencil close around your body. When you get up,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>it’s perfect. They cut you out and add a few details. They deliver the sign to the burlesque
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>house where it’s hung up over the street. It swings in the wind.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>After this, everyone looks at you differently. When the guy comes to measure you,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>he says that he has to measure all the dimensions of your body because theyre planning
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>on remodeling the mill and want to make sure that the corridors are wide enough for
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>everyone, even when you are turned sideways. So every week now the foreman measures
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>your budding chest, your hips and your ass, as well as your height. Then he marks it
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>down on the wall. People come around on their coffee breaks to note any changes in
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>your measurement.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>You don’t know what week it happened, but, one week or one month, you are just
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>too tall. No one really notices because they are intent on the other measurements of
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>your body.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>One day you are standing there and, being the wrong height for the sawmill, get
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>cracked on the back of the head with a two by four. Perhaps it wasn’t your height,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>although your height was really too tall for the yard. Perhaps it was some new short
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>guy they hired. But it really doesn’t matter, you are on the floor in the sawdust. You’re
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>knocked out.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Who knows what happened while you were out! When you came to, nobody was
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>around. Before you could move, you felt smooth strictures on your body, especially the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>torso. At first you thought they might be bandages, but when you maneuvered your
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>head into position you could see that you were dressed in a tight silver lamé costume
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>—high cut legs, low cut bosom. Silver platform shoes. You didn’t dare look in a mirror.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>There was no mirror, except for the huge mill blade that took up most of the floor in
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>this room.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>You looked in the blade mirror and saw that you could quit this job and go to work
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>in the burlesque house. When you turn around to look at your ass, you notice there’s a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>note on it. You take off the note and read it. It says: Happy Birthday, from the guys
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>P.S. You’re too tall.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>You walk out into the open evening, a few blocks
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>down the main street, over to the burlesque house.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>They hire you right away. But, they say, do you have
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>an act? You say you’ll have to think about this. In
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the back room, with an old satin dressing gown
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>thrown over your shoulders, you sit at the desk
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>next to the radiator. You try to think of an act.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>You could dedicate your act to the guys at
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the sawmill—wear little blade earrings and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>dance on logs in a pool of silver water. You
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>could dedicate your act to your parents, i.e.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>only do the act once and then forget about
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>it. Or, you could dedicate your act to both
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>the guys and your parents. You could
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>have electric saws strapped to your
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>wrists. Then you could saw off all
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N017'/>your clothes piece by piece, shivering
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N018'/>and shimmying and shaking as
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N019'/>you went. Then you could saw off
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N020'/>your fingers and throw them into
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N021'/>the audience. Your left arm, your
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N022'/>leg. You could saw off every part
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N023'/>and throw it to them. The peo
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N024'/>ple at the burlesque house
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N025'/>think that this is a great idea
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N026'/>since they’Il only have to pay you
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N027'/>once. You can go on stage that very
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N028'/>night.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N029'/>When you go out onto the stage the lights
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N030'/>are burning up into your face, but you can
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N031'/>still see the audience: all the guys from the mill
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N032'/>have shown up, as well as the regulars. It’s packed.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N033'/>People are shouting encouragement from every corner.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N034'/>Theyre proud. You lift up your little saws on your wrists
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N035'/>and turn them on. The audience gets very excited. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N036'/>you start slicing. You throw the silver remnants into the audience
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N037'/>as you bare your arms, legs, breasts and ass. Everybody&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N038'/>shouting. But as you try to finish your act, as you look at your
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N039'/>left breast with extreme care and bring both whirring saws toward
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N040'/>it lovingly, the audience lets out a huge gasp and grabs out for
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N041'/>you. Men rush the stage in sensual terror. As they tackle you
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N042'/>your saws hit the floor of the wooden stage and start throwing
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N043'/>up sawdust in every direction. The pink stuff sticks to everything
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N044'/>gets in your eyes, mixes with the silver oil on your skin. You say
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N045'/>all around in a mixed effort to get up and finish your act, also to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N046'/>ward off your assailants/saviours. You saw all around, flailing
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N047'/>your arms in every direction. You saw the backdrop, the stage,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N048'/>the front row. By this time, the audience has run out in terror
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N049'/>and you seem to be alone with a bunch of lumber.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N050'/>Not seeing the managers, you pick up your tattered outfit
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N051'/>and walk out into the street. You walk home, arms weighted
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N052'/>and balanced by the electric saws. When you get to your front
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N053'/>door, you stand on the porch suppressing an attempt to saw it
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N054'/>all down. You wait outside until your mother comes to the door.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N055'/>She knows something’s out there by the sound of your saws.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N056'/>She takes one look at you, then unstraps the saws from your
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>wrists in the same

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>used to push your

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>uncontrollable arms when you were a baby. She puts the saws
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>down on the coffee table and takes you upstairs, takes off the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>remnants of your costume and puts you in a hot tub.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The next day you are invited into the manager’s office at
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the sawmill.

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>You straighten out your clothes, get up to walk out.

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>You close the grey door to this temporary building; then walk
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>out into the street. A few blocks down, the burlesque house
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stands blankly. A pink cut-out of your body swings on its hinges
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_13_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>noisily. Not long after this you leave your town for good.

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N005'/>Going somewhere just to be going. That’s all I was
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N006'/>doing. Just going somewhere to be going. Oh, but did it
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N007'/>sound good though! Shirley called me up, say:  &quot;You want to go
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N008'/>to Montreal? I got to get out a this dead-ass town for a minute. Got
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N009'/>some people I know up there and girl, you betta get ready come go with me.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N010'/>Montreal. What did I know about Montreal? Not a thing. But just the name of it
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N011'/>child. The word sounded so elegant and sexy. Tall, thin, serious-looking men with little
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N012'/>mustaches and French accents must live in a city with that kind a name. A place where people
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N013'/>sipped wine and served up crepes and caviar on crystal. A city where a woman was likely to fall in
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N014'/>love. Did I want to go to Montreal? - Hell, yes. Just tell me what time the plane leaves.  Wasn’t until we
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>were way up high in that cool, air-conditioned cabin in the sky
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>did it occur to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>&quot;Shirley. Any Black people in Montreal?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Shirley clicked her teeth at my ignorance.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;Course yes, girl. What you think my friends are?”
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>So I settled on back in my seat to sip on the complimentar
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>wine the stewardess had handed around. Then I sat up again.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>&quot;Shirley. They speak French up there in Montreal, don’t they
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Well,&quot; I answer to her bored nod, &quot;how we supposed to talk to
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the people? You know any French?
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>My slow-wittedness must a been too much for my girl Shir
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ley to take. She shook her head and rolled her eyes on up to the
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>airplane ceiling
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;Darlene child, you don’t need to know no language.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>&quot;Oh. Tell me something, then.&quot; I still wasn’t what you might
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>call convinced, but then, who was I to argue?
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Just relax, girl.&quot; All Shirley need to do is step on a plane
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and she tumn sophisticated. She smiled a superior little smile
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;You gone enjoy Montreal.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>How Shirley know what l’m gone enjoy? Far as I know she
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ain’t never been to Montreal either. And much as I like her, I got
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to admit that Shirley’s the kind a woman pretend she know
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>something when she don’t. Always been. Me, I believe in doing
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>like my momma say. &quot;If you don’t know, ask!
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>By the time the plane landed, l’d nearly worn out my eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>trying to sightsee from the air. I mean, this here was some sure
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>enough excitement! Me—Darlene Lou Williams who ain’t never
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>been further from Detroit than Toledo. In Montreal! I shool
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Shirley awake.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;Wake up, girl. We here.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>My first glimpse of the city was a little disappointing. Right
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>off the bat, Montreal wasn’t looking a whole lot different from
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Detroit. It was a lot cleaner, sure. A whole lot of tall, fancy sky
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>scrapers rubbing sides with buildings of old stone. It might
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>have been the same Detroit women walking the twilight streets
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>in winter coats or the occasional fur. It might almost have been
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Detroit.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>But, no. It felt a bit different, now that I started taking it in
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Something fresh and foreign in the way the streetlights fell across
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the sidewalk. A different rhythm in the movement of traffic and
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pedestrians. Street signs at intersections written both in En
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>glish and French.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>With my taxi window rolled half-way down, I could hear
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>snatches of a language that wasn’t mine. I was in Montreal.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Quebec. Canada! I gobbled it down with my eyes and ears.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>even sniffed the air to see if it smelled different. It did. Don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ask me how. One thing had me worried, though.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&quot;Shirley, where all the Black folks at?
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;Oh. They around,&quot; she blaséed back. “They around. And
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>let down that window, will you? You letting cold air in the cab.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The hotel wasn’t the best. Wasn’t really nasty or nothing,
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>but you could tell it had seen better years. Wood kind a dusty
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and rubbed down. Rugs faded, with a few bare spots. And a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>faint and musty odor hung in the lobby that reminded me of old
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>folks.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>A nice-looking li’l ole brother carried up our bags for us.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>(Course, I didn’t see no reason for him to bother, but Shirley
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>wouldn’t have it any other way. &quot;Let him carry that!” she hisses
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>when I go to grab my grip. &quot;That’s what he here for.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Riding up to the eighth floor, the brother be eyeing me on
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the sly. You know those little mirrors always be stuck for some
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>reason, in the corners of elevators? I glance up there to pat my
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>hair and I catch his eye, steady on me
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I give him a little smile, cause I know l’m looking good. I
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>may be a big woman, but I do try to keep myself up. And I know
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>when I be looking good. Today’s one a them days. Got on a
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>sharp little sharkskin suit, and every piece a gold I own.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>(&quot;You don’t need to be wearing all that white.&quot; On our way to
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the airport, Shirley come narrowing her eyes at me. &quot;White ain’t
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>practical to travel in and, you know...” She let the words trail
			</p>
			<pb n='59'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>off, but I do know. She trying to say l’m to big to wear white. But
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I don’t care, cause I know when l’m looking sharp. Besides which,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>this is all woman, every ounce. Ain’ every man likes his womar
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>looking like a refugee from the potato famine. Plenty brothers I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>know appreciate a lady with a little cushioning on her).
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Like this li’l ole brother carrying our bags into the room. I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>hand him a hefty tip, he flash me a wink and gone. Too bad he
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>so little. It’s hard to get interested in a man you could crush in
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the clinches.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;Why you flirting with that old nothing Negro?&quot; Shirley want
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to know. She all up in the full-length mirror, hit it first thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Eyeing her spare little behind in Calvin Kleins.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&quot;Flirting? All I was doing was being nice. After all, we all
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Black folks. It don’t hurt to be nice. Course, he was kind a cute,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>wasn&apos;t he?
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>&quot;A bellhop. Nothing but a lowly li’l bellhop.&quot; When a man a
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>bellhop, I guess cute don’t enter into it. (Just between you anc
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>me, I think the girl’s jaws got tight cause the man ain’t so much
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>as cracked a glance in her direction. Shirley not the kind a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>take kindly to being ignored. Especially by a man).
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I hadn’t hardly sat down good, getting ready to pull off the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sling-back pumps, when Shirley was ready to hit the streets.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>&quot;Let’s get out of here. But first, you need to change. That
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>white’s too dressy. Slip on some jeans or something.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>&quot;Out? Shirley, why don’t we catch a little rest first?” I was
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>wrung out and my feet were killing me. Good as they looked in
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>those narrow slingbacks, my toes didn’t take too kindly to being
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>crammed together so tight.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>You should a napped on the plane, like I did. Come let’s go
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>girl. Plenty a rest back home in Detroit. We in Montreal now.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>What you want to hang around the hotel for?
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>So into the jeans (didn’t do me half the justice of the shark-
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>skin suit) and out the door I went, right behind Shirley
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>It had gotten good and dark, and the Montreal streets had a
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>slick quality to them. There was a light rain falling and the
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>night was cool, brightly lit.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Shirley be the walkingest woman! Up this street and down
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the next. Peeping up at dresses in this, or that darkened store
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>window. My feet begging me for mercy all the way along. Ain’t
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>no way you can enjoy window-shopping when your feet be pain
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ing you.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>We finally stopped at a little restaurant, had us a bit to eat. I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>wasn’t all that hungry, cause I had eaten on the plane. But I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>didn’t object. It felt so good to be sitting down, honey.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>’Where you want to go next?” We hadn’t gotten our dinner
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>down good and here Shirley go again, itching to get back out in
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the streets. She whipped a guide book out of her purse. &quot;You
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>want to check out a disco? We got time. They say they don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>close until three in the morning.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>&quot;Hey, what about these here friends of yours? Don’t you want
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>to look them up?&quot; Cause I didn’t look forward to no evening
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>disco-ing on my poor swollen feet. Maybe Shirley’s friends had
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>someplace quiet where we could set down.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>For some reason, Shirley looked real closed and uneasy at
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>that suggestion.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>&quot;Well.“ She sips her ’some kind a liquor.&apos; &quot;I guess we could
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>go by and see them. If they at home.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>&quot;Why don’t you call them and see?
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>We hunted up a public phone after walking (what seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>to my feet like) another hundred miles.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>&quot;Moss&quot; Shirley was yelling into the receiver. &quot;Shirley Ann
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Moss. Yes, Moss...I met you in Milwaukee, you and your hus
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>band...Um, yes. Madeline Brown’s daughter’s wedding. Y’all
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>said to look you up if I ever came to Montreal...
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>That Shirley. Got us traipsing off to Canada, coming to see
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>friends&quot; that don’t even remember her. That girl is a mess.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>&quot;Right now,” she was saying. &quot;Me and a friend a mine ... Uhn
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>huhn. Just got in this evening...Uhn-huhn. Well, anytime. How
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>about tonight? ...Really? Alright!
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>When she hung up she was looking pleased and surprised.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>&quot;They say come right over. Theyre
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>having some friends by for
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>drinks.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Montreal night was one of shiny lights and deep, deep darks.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Slick wet streets, white bright lights. A raw full moon shining
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>like a white nickel against off-black velvet. And something tall
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>looming in the sky met that moon in a point. I really ought to
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>wear those eyeglasses I paid so much money for. What was
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that, a building? A tower? It almost seemed like something liv-
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing, but tall as that thing was, wasn’t no way it could be alive.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Could it?
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I didn’t study on it long, though. The tires of the taxi moving
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>on the ground was making such a wet and comforting sound.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Just the right kind of rhythm to lull you to sleep. I had to fight it
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>hard. Cause tired as I was, once I gave in wouldn’t nothing be
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>able to wake me.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>&quot;How well do you know these friends of yours, Shirley?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>“Theyre good friends of my friend Maddy.&quot; Her chin jutted
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>out &quot;Very good friends. Came down to Milwaukee for her daugh-
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ter’s wedding.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>&quot;Hmmmph.&quot; If these friends were anything like Shirley&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>hincty, social-climbing little girlfriend, Maddy Brown, I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>want no parts of them.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>It was high-priced luxury we pulled up in front of. I could
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tell that even without my glasses. Had landscaped lawns and
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>uniformed doorman, if you please. Shirley smirked proudly, like
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>she owned the place.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>&quot;Class,&quot; she whispers, and nudged me in the side. I nod
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ded, but couldn’t help thinking that without the potted plants
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and doorman, it wouldn’t look a whole lot different than those
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>highrise housing projects home in Detroit.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Stepped into the people’s apartment and like to fell over,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>child. Shag carpeting was so thick you sunk in up to your ankles.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>A few friends over for drinks? Lord, child this was a full
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>blown party going on here. It was so crammed with folks, me
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and Shirley had to elbow our way through. Me and my sore feet
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>made for an empty seat at the dining table. Shirley, with a stiff
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>smile stretched across her face (she was impressed, honey) went
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>off looking for her friends.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>People might a thought I was a junkie that night. Cause I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>set myself down to that table and commenced to nodding. I
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>couldn’t help it. I propped my elbows up, put my head in my
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>hands, and nodded down.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Don’t know how long I sat there, half-asleep, longing for my
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>hotel bed. But some people sitting down to the table kind a
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>shook me awake. They came carrying conversation with them.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>A short, scraggly-headed man with a French accent. A thin,
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>intense-looking darkskin sister. Him, gesturing and expostulatin’
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Her, nodding and staring and asking questions. The stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>sounded serious to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>We are ze largest French-speaking city outside of Parees.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>The boy sounded just like them Frenchmen in the movies. &quot;Over
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>sixty-percent of zis citee is Francophone. So why must everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>speak English in order to get ahead? Eh?
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>The girl scooched closer, leaning over in a listening way.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>’Uhm-hmm.&quot; She nodded, staring at him with the blackest
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>eyes. &quot;But don’t you think people should lear both languages?
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>We are a bilingual country.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Some of the scraggly brown hair fell across the fellow’s face.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>He reached up an impatient hand to push it back.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>&quot;But don’t you see?” he was saying earnestly. “Ze English-
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>speaking minority does not find eet necessary to leam French.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Eeet is because zey have zee power, no?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>&quot;French and English-speaking Canadians must learn to live
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>together,&quot; the girl recited, like something out of a schoolbook.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>Even to my unschooled ear, it sounded like a crock a crap.
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>No, no, no!&quot; The fellow was good and frustrated. He shook
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>his head, sending those scraggly locks all over it again. &quot;We do
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>live together. Zis ees not ze point. Eet is language, eet is culture
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>which separates us. Not so&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_2_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>&quot;We are all Canadians,&quot; the dark sister say stubbornly, lean
			</p>
			<pb n='60'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ing all up in his face. &quot;No matter which language or culture.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Ah, yes,” he raises one finger in revelation. &quot;But you must
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>have felt it—ze racism. You, as a Black in a land of whites.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>By now I was interested. I felt like leaning over with a “Tell
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>it, brother!&quot;, but the man had continued on.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;So you must see zat we Francophones in Montreal feel it.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Ze Engleesh is ze language of commerce, of politics. You cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>get a good job without eet. Eeet is almost as in South Africa
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>yes? Ze majority is ruled by ze minority. Don’t you agree?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>I nodded. It made perfect sense when he put it like that. But
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>this child was having none of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I don’t know anything about Africa,” she say like she proud
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of it or something. &quot;Tm a Canadian.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;Yes, but you a Black Canadian.&quot; I bust out before I can stoj
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>myself. &quot;Just like he’s a French Canadian. Everybody here come
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>from somewhere else. Lessen you a Indian.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>And black as you are child, you need to be knowing some
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>thing about Africa, I felt like saying. But didn’t.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Honey, the sister turned and looked me up and down. You&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>a thought one of them potted plants had got up and butt into
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the conversation. Then she whipped her head back without a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>word, ready to tune up the discussion with the French fellow
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>again. But by then he was looking over at me. And asking me i
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I want to dance.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I was a head and a-half taller than him (and had a few pounds
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>on him to boot), but what the hell? I kicked off them tight shoes,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>got up, and gave him my hand.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>See, this is why I don’t like dancing with no short fellows,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>particularly white ones. They get a woman with a little weight
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>on her, all of a sudden they forget how to lead. And this little
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>man, child he was a mess. I tried to lean into the step, give him
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>a little confidence to pick up the lead. Do you know he took two
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>steps backward and like to have fell over?
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Honey, it was awful. One of them long records too, and he
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>was determined to dance it to the end. Lucky the floor was
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>crowded, couldn’t nobody see what was going down. I put up
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>with this shuffling little slow dance, the dude’s head pressed
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>against my bosom, and me looking down at a bald spot in the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>middle of his head. All that scraggly hair and he got the nerve
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>to have a bald spot in the middle of his head. Don’t that beat
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>all? And Lord, he trying so hard to keep the beat that a sweat
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>done popped out on the bald spot.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Merciful Heaven, the record finally ended. He led me on back
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to the table (hadn’t said not a word since he’d asked me to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>dance), pulled out my chair. And I ain’t lying
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Madame.&quot; He gave a little bow. &quot;You dance like an angel.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>l’m glad he walked away, cause I had to bust out laughing.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;Child,&quot; I said to the dark sister, still sitting hunched up at
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the table. “The man got two left feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Some people are just too saddity. She kind of half-turned
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>toward me, looking down that long nose a hers. Like she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>know what the hell I was talking about.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Well, l’d be damned if I was going to sit there and take some
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>body looking at me (as my momma would say) &quot;in that tone a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>voice.&quot; I figure Miss Saddity’s jaws got tight cause her friend
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>had asked me to dance instead of her. I got up and switched,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>bare feet and all, right into the next room. Which happened to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>be the kitchen. From then on I started to enjoy myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Shirley’s so-called friends were in there (a lively little West
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Indian couple) frying plantain and hiding from their guests. I
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>liked them. Beverly and Neville were worlds away from Maddy
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Brown. Just some plain, down-home type a folks who just
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>happened to live up in Bourgie Heights and teach at the univer
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sity. At least Neville did. Beverly say she run some kind of shop
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>selling Bahamian handicrafts. I spent the evening with them in
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the kitchen greasing, drinking, and loud-talking
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>&quot;I tell you something about these academic types,” Neville
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dished me out a plate of rice and peas. Three dinners in a sin
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>gle evening was a lot even for me. But what the hell. This was
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Montreal, as Shirley was so fond of saying. &quot;They don’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>how to have a party. They come, sit around and talk politics,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>drink a little wine. Now when we talk party, we talking bout
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>some good rum, good folk, and good food, sista.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>&quot;I heard that,&quot; I had to testify, my mouth full of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Time I came from out the kitchen, most of the people had
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>gone. There was one couple left, dancing on the floor (and talk
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>about clinches, honey—they slow-dragged it to every tune). And
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>there was Shirley, that French fellow, and Miss Saddity sitting
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>at the table.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>&quot;Shirley, l’m ready to go.&quot; I don’t believe in hanging onto a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>party once the fun’s gone out. Besides, Beverly and Neville yawn
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ing wide is good enough hint for me
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Not yet,&quot; Shirley whisper back. “The night’s still young, girl.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>We in Montreal.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>So I sat down, trying to keep from yawning myself. Neville
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>finished his drink and gone on to bed. Beverly going around
			</p>
			<pb n='61'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>picking up glasses and emptying ashtrays. And here Shirley
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sits, talking about some night still young. I swear, that girl is a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mess.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>&quot;So you work in a library?” Shirley was smirking up into the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>French fellow’s face. &quot;How fascinating.&quot; Looked like Shirley had
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>latched onto herself something. No wonder she was in no hurry
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to leave.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>And here the man goes, blushing and hitching himself up
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>like a little banty rooster.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;Well, yes,&quot; he says, important-like. “Ze university librar
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>has so many responsibilities...
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>And I do believe Shirley’s moving in on Miss Saddity’s thun
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>der. Miss S just hanging around on the edge of the conversa
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tion, looking pitiful and hopeful at the same time. The man
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>shortage must be even worse here than in Detroit, if the sisters
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>have to compete for little lopped-off fellows like this one here
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>&quot;And what do you do?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Miss Saddity turn on me so sudden, the question so out of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the blue that it threw me. I started to come back with a, “What
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>doI do when?&quot; When it occurred to me she meant, &quot;for a living.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>&quot;I work in a hospital,&quot; I answered.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>&quot;Oh, really?” She look at me with such distaste, you’d think
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I said I worked in a zoo.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Yes, Assistant Director of Communications,” I snap back
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>real crisp in my ’company’ voice. Now chew on that for awhile,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Miss Saddity.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Honey child, you’d a thought somebody had just told the

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>look astounded? Then, for the first time since l’d seen her, she
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>smiled.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>That’s very interesting! Is that something in the journalism

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Eager-Beaver. It kind a embarassed me. Yes, she herself was in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the communications field, a student of journalism. She studied
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>at MCGill University, where Neville taught. And she was think
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ing of going to graduate school in the States. Could I make any
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>suggestions. She’d heard that Columbia was good, but was il
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the best? And how did I like working in the field? Was it chal
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lenging? And was I in Montreal in connection with my work
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>No, well there were so many opportunites for travel in journal
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ism. And this, and that, and the other. Questions! When the girl
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>let me loose, I was tired. Felt like l’d been through the fifth de-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>gree. Questions. I tried to tell the child that paging doctors ove
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the hospital P.A. was a long way from writing stories in the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Tribune. But she wouldn’t listen long enough for me to get a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>good word in.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Shirley (Merciful Heavens) broke into this intimate conver
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>sation with some news of her own. Could she please see me in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the kitchen? The girl was looking as smug as a housecat with a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>mouthful of canary and I soon found out why
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>&quot;Darlene,&quot; she leaned up against the refrigerator, looking
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>dreamy. &quot;I met a man.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>&quot;I know. Henri, the librarian.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>&quot;Tm taking him back to the room with me. Do you mind?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Mind? I was flabbergasted. My hotel room? She must a been
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>talking about some other hotel room. I knew she couldn’t be
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>talking about mine. Not with my poor body crying, no screaming
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>for sleep. And Shirley Ann Moss wants to roll around my bed
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>with some old French white fellow? Impossible.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>&quot;He ain’t white.&quot; Shirley shakes her California curls. &quot;He is
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>Jewish, l’II have you know.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>Now see, I ain’t never been one to judge. If that’s the way you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>want to go, that’s okay by me. But don’t lie about it, you know?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>&quot;Girl, you too much.&quot; I mean it. The girl amazes me. &quot;Jewish
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>is a religion, not a race. Being Jewish don’t keep him from being
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>white.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>&quot;So. Maybe he is. But he works, don’t he? Got a good job.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>And it ain’t as no bellhop, either.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>&quot;Careful, Shirley,&quot; I warn. “The Lord don’t like ugly and l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>not too crazy about it myself. Don’t mess with me.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Shirley frowns and smacks her lips. &quot;Darlene, you just too
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>straight-laced. You ought to loosen up, girl. We here to enjoy
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ourselves. We in...
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;Montreal,&quot; I finished for her. &quot;I know we in Montreal. Where
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>(if you remember) I don’t know a solitary soul. Where the hell
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>l’m supposed to sleep tonight while you’re entertaining? And
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>how come the guy can’t take you to his place? He must be
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>married.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>No.&quot; But Shirley looks worried. &quot;It’s just that he lives so far
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>out in the suburbs, the drive would take forever...
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>He’s married.&quot; I’m convinced. And also resigned. If Shirley
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>wants to have her fun, let her. &quot;Just find a place for me to sack
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>out and soon, so you and M’sieur can get down to the good
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>times.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Beverly was called in for a conference.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;So you and Henri got together.“ She gives our girl Shirley
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>an appraising glance. A knowing smile. &quot;He always has liked
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>his women dark.&quot; Then she turned to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>&quot;You could have slept on the sofa y’know, if it hadn’t been
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>for that.&quot; She pointed. Through a counter cut into the kitchen
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>wall, past the dining area we could see into the livingroom. It
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was a heaving shadow of someone snoring on the couch.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>&quot;Who&apos;s that?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Beverly shrugged. &quot;Some drunk fool. Now where we goin’ to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sleep you, child? I guess you could sleep over Cedella’s.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;Who’s Cedella? Not that Black Canadian girl.&quot; Miss Saddity
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>didn’t look like no Cedella to me. Seemed like Penelope or Mil-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>licent would be more in her line.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Beverly pooted with her mouth. “Canadian, me backside. If
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that girl ain’t Bahamian, then I ain’t. Some man find her in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Nassau seven years ago, bring her here, marry and divorce her.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Now she call herself Canadian.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>It was decided that l’d sleep over at Cedella’s. Beverly tugged
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>my arm on the way out the kitchen and whispered.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>&quot;What Cedella have to say about Henri and your friend?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>&quot;She didn’t say nothing. Why? Why should she have some
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>thing to say about it?
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Beverly shook her head. “Let’s just say, Cedella may have
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>thought she had a claim staked out in that area. She gone be a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>bit surprised.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>A bit? Walking in there where the three of them stood, their
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>coats already on, l’m more than a little uneasy. Cause Miss
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Cedella-Saddity’s looking mighty blissful, like maybe she’s
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>expecting to take her stuff home with her. Poor thing. l’m sure
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that she (smiling up in Henri’s face) don’t yet know the lay of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the land.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>&quot;Cedella, you mind putting up Darlene for the evening?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>&quot;Oh. No, of course not.&quot; But Cedella’s looking around with
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>puzzled eyes, an open mouth, and a look that says, Darlene
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>definitely not the one I was planning on taking home.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>So out the door, arm in arm, go Miss Shirley and Mr. Henri
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Hotshot. Cedella’s eyes follow them, like a puppy left alone at
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>home. Me and Beverly exchange a look.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>&quot;Cedella don’t live far. You want me to give you a ride?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>I open my mouth to say &quot;Yes, Lordy,&quot; but Cedella beat me to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>the punch. She stand there, shaking her head like she’s coming
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>out of a trance.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>&quot;No, we’ll walk it. I could use the walk.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>I went and got my coat, followed her out the door, fuming.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>During the evening inside, snow had dusted the Montreal streets.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>A few flakes were still drifting in the air as we crunched our
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>way across the street. These shoes definitely weren’t made for
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>walking. Especially in no snow. My poor toes, cold and squeezed
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>together, protested silently. They’d be good and swole up, come
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>tomorrow.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>The hell it wasn’t far. Cedella walked me uphill, through a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>courtyard, across a low bridge over a slow, snow-covered river,
			</p>
			<pb n='62'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>around a couple of corners and finally...
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>We stopped in front of a building that looked just like the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>rest of the row it was joined to. Rowhouses we would have callec
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>them in Detroit. Except these looked odd—no stone steps or
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>stoops, but long black iron staircases stretching up three sto
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ries, looking to me like fire escapes stuck to the front of the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>house.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Before I climbed down the stairs to Cedella’s basement apart
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ment, I got that peculiar feeling. The feeling someone was look
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing over my shoulder. I turned, and of course there was no one
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Only the quiet street and above it the once-clear sky, now cloudy
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>with snow. But against the soft black of that night sky was
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>something softer and blacker still. Something solid and sub
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stantial looming in the light of moon. Tomorrow I would find
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>out what it was.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Cedella’s apartment was nothing more than a couple of rooms
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>wedged between a maze of pipes and fixtures.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>That couch of hers was looking awfully inviting, so I made
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>a beeline for it. Cedella disappeared in the direction of anothe
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>room. I had pulled off my shoes, about to stretch out and ges
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>comfortable. When here she come, sailing back in with a tray
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and two big cups of coffee on it.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Coffee. Now what I want with coffee at this time a night
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Sleep was so heavy on me that I felt drunk. My mind so dull
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and tired that I had reached for the cup and was drinking from
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>it before I knew what I was doing.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>&quot;So,&quot; Cedella plopped down on the couch beside me
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>stretched her thin little face in a grin. And launched full speed
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ahead into verbal assault. “Tell me all about your job as a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>journalist in the States.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Lord, where do they make these people? Please tell me, so I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>can call up and have them break the mold.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>She went at me like a cat worrying a cold dead mouse. Ques
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tions. &quot;When did I?” and &quot;How did I like?&quot; and &quot;How long does
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>it take?” Questions. She prized answers out of my sleepy mouth
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and threw them away before they were even out good. Couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>hardly wait til l’d answered one, before she was pinning me
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>with another one. Looking at me with bright big eyes and nod
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ding, nodding, nodding. And wasn’t listening to a word I said.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;This is really my first time out the country” I was answer-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ing some inquiry or another.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The girl’s head went to nodding again, barely stopping for
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>her to take a sip of coffee. Nodding. One or two, &quot;uhm-hmm’s&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to go with it
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;Go on,&quot; she bobs. &quot;Go on.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;Tm a little tired, Cedella.&quot; I had to try and put a stop to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>this. This kind a thing could go on all night. &quot;Been on my feet
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>since early this morning. Packing, traveling, unpacking. You
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>know.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Uhm-hmm, uhm-hmm.“ Bright eyes in dark face, peering
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>at me over the top of her cup. She looked like a dark little bird
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sipping coffee. &quot;Did you have a nice flight?&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>That was when I went from feeling irritated, to feeling sorry.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Poor Cedella. A child-sized woman in sweater too big that hung
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>past her wrists. Sitting, sipping coffee at three in the blessed
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>morning with her legs tucked under her. Busy making manic
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>conversation with a near stranger. Cedella nodded again, though
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I had said nothing. I couldn’t help shaking my head. Poor child.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>&quot;Watch it, woman,&quot; Hank Harris would a said if he’d been
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>there and could see inside my head. &quot;You mother is coming
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>out.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>My ex-husband always maintained that for a woman with
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>no young ones, I did more than my share of mothering. Saic
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>that forever playing somebody’s momma was bound to be my
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>undoing. He ought to know, he played the baby often enough
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>when we were together.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Still, I had to admit the man had a point. Else, why was
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sitting there fighting sleep in a basement apartment somewhere
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>in Montreal? And the chattering little bird that was keeping me
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>up, I suddenly had the urge to take in my arms and tell her &quot;It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>alright.&quot; Alright that she had to come home in want of a man,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>cause my friend Shirley had walked off with him. That I under
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>stood how loneliness could come down in the dead of the night,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and you’d almost want to talk to walls, just to be talking to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>someone.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Course I didn’t press the girl to my bosom. I did just as
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>good. Gave her a smile, and an ear. Forced back sleep, talked a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>little, listened a lot, answered questions and drank coffee until
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>near five o’clock in the morning
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>When the girl was all talked out, I couldn’t have told you
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>what we’d talked about to save my life. But it was over, thank

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that lumpy couch
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>goodness. I finally got to curl up
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and close my eyes. But not for long.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Seems like hadn’t but a minute passed when that crazy child
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>wasn’t shaking me awake, saying I had a phone call. Shirley on
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the line, just as cheerful as though it wasn’t nine o’clock.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;Hey, girl. What it is?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Shirley, you out a your mind. What you calling me so early
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for? Get on back to sleep, girl, and let me do the same.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; Shirley calls out before I could hang up.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>got to talk to you about something.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Aw, hell.&quot; I struggle up into a sitting position. &quot;You gone
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>worry me to death. What you want? And where’d you get this
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>number from?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Shirley paused. Her normally boisterous voice turned meek
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and squeaky.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>&quot;Henri,&quot; she finally answered. &quot;He gave it to me.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>&quot;Oh, did he now? Lucky he happened to have it with him,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wasn’t it? Did he know it by heart, or was it written down in his
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>little black book? And how is little ole Henry this morning, all
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>curled up in my bed?” Hank always did say I be a’ evil woman
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>first thing in the morning
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>&quot;He’s just fine,&quot; Shirley snap back. &quot;And don’t be sarcastic.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Look, what time you planning on coming back here?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>&quot;I don’t know, girl. Whatever time I get there. Why?”
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>&quot;Well,&quot; Shirley’s voice goes squeaky again. &quot;Try to make it
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>late, huh? Not before one o’clock, at least. Alright?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Girl, you mean to tell me ya’ll ain’t finish with it yet? I
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>didn’t think that little man had it in him.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;Don’t be so backwards, Darlene Williams. This ain’t De
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>troit, you know. This is...&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>If you tell me Montreal one more time, l’m a kill you.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>That Moss woman is a peck a trouble! Maybe if she hadn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>come waking me up, I would have stayed sleep until one o’clock.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Maybe. Wasn’t no guarantee of that with Cedella on the case.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>You ever heard of a night owl that likes to get up early
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Honey, if Cedella was bee-busy last night, you should a seen
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her that morning.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>&quot;Oh, good. You’re awake.&quot; she bustles in. &quot;Come on in the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>kitchen.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Grumbling, I hie myself up from that lousy couch and fol
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>low her into that cubicle she call a kitchen. Thinking that since
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>she didn’t succeed in talking me to death last night, aim to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>finish me off this morning.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Now, drink up,” she pressed another cup of coffee on me
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>&quot;We’ve got a big day ahead of us.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>&quot;We?&quot; I’m sitting at the kitchen table, my head as heavy as a
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>bowling bowl. Trying to peel open my eyelids. &quot;I don’t remem
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ber us making any plans for today.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>&quot;I thought l’d take you around, show you the city. There’s so
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>much to see in Montreal—the Underground City, and the...
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>&quot;I can’t go nowhere looking like this,&quot; I protest, pointing to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>my slept-in jeans.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>&quot;You look fine.&quot; The little liar. &quot;Really, you do. Just a little
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>rumpled, but you can use my iron. I wish I had something to fit
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>you, but...&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>She incline her head in my direction, and I hurry up and say
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>it before she does. &quot;I know you don’t, honey. l’d take two a you
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>to make one a me. Anybody can see that.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>I went along with the plans Cedella had cooked up cause I
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>could’t think of a way to get out of it. And didn’t have nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>better to do between ten and one o’clock. With hot coffee slosh-
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>ing around inside, I tried in vain to take the bed wrinkles out of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>my jeans.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>And then we were out in the city. The snow had melted
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>leaving little patches of wet on the ground. I breathed in the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>cool, soft air and looked around.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>And then it jumped on me. That dark center of a presence
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>l’d only sensed last night. There it was, a proud brown lady
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>sitting pretty. Right smack dab in the center of the city, no less.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>&quot;Jesus,&quot; I couldn’t help but call the Lord’s name. &quot;If that

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ain&apos;t one mother of a mounte
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>&quot;Oh, that.&quot; Cedella waved her hand carelessly at the majes
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tic lady with trees in her skirt. I had stopped in the sidewalk to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>look, and she nudged me on. &quot;You haven’t seen the mountain?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>That’s where the city’s name comes from. Mont Real. The Royal
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Mountain.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;The Royal Mountain,&quot; I repeated, turning around for an
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>other look. &quot;Ain’t that something. And wouldn’t I like to go up
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>there. They let folks climb it?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Yes, but you don’t want to go up there at this time of year.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Cedella was firmly guiding me down the street. “There’s skiing
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>there when we have snow. And it’s nice in the summertime
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>—there’s a park and look-out point. But right now, there’s noth
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing up there but mud. Now, come on. I want to take you to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>see...
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I followed her down the street, but kept turning back for a
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>peek up at that Royal Mountain. A mountain in the middle of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the city. How do you like that?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;Old Montreal isn’t far from here,&quot; Cedella was saying. &quot;It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>just a twenty minute walk.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>&quot;No.&quot; I stopped right in the sidewalk, obstinate as a mule.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>My feet had decided for me. I was walking nowhere this day
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>&quot;Don’t they have buses or trains in this city? Why everybody got
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>to walk where theyre going?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Cedella, like that Royal Mountain, looked different in the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>daylight. Her skin ashier, her face more pinched, her expres
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sion somewhere between a crochety old woman and a pouty
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>child.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;Alright,&quot; she smacks her lips. &quot;We can take the Metro, if
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>you insist. Though why you’d want to ride on a beautiful day
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>like this...
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>We rode. The Metro was heaven, honey. Wasn’t nothing like
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>l’d imagine a subway to be. The station was like a museum,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>hung with pictures and works of art. Train rode just as quiet,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and clean. I couldn’t help thinking sadly, how they’d mess all
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>this up inside a week, back home in Detroit.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The ride was much too short. Less than ten minutes later we
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>were out and walking.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Looking and walking around this here Old Montreal wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>as bad as l’d thought. The sun was out and so were the folks.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Nothing like Sunday morning in Detroit. People walked the streets
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>like they were on their way places, but not in a hurry. Vendors
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>sold things from stands along the road, flowers and fruit and
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>postcards. Children romped as children will, throwing things
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>to each other and calling out in a fast language it seemed I
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>knew, but just couldn’t understand. I knew I was in a foreign
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>country, but it wasn’t really that foreign to me. The place was
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>really waking me up.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>But honey, would the child ever stop talking? Determined to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>play the tour guide, she wouldn’t so much as let me sit down to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>rest my feet and just drink in the new sights. She just had to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>show me every old church and courtyard and cobblestone street.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>In the meantime, in between time, she chattered. This morning
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>the subject was herself.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>&quot;I don’t know whether to take French or Spanish,&quot; she fret-
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ted. “There’s a language requirement at university. I just can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>decide.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>&quot;Folks here speak French, don’t they?” I reasoned, not really
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>caring. Those cobblestones were murdering my feet. “Take
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>French.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>’Ye-e-es.&quot; Her black eyes got wide, she cocked her head to
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>the side like a noisy little blackbird. &quot;But since I may be relo
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>cating to the States, maybe Spanish would help me more. Espe
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>cially in a journalism career. What do you think?
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>I wouldn’t know.&quot; I was getting tired of this girl and her
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>chatter. &quot;Do to suit yourself.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>Cedella stopped in the street and narrowed her eyes at me.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>’You don’t seem at all like a journalist,&quot; she accused. &quot;One
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>would never know it from your conversation.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>I came to a halt too, put my hands on my hips. We faced

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>each other down in a silent duel, Dodge City on cobblestones
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>This little fool needed some serious talking to, and I was just
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the one to do the job.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>So what?&quot; A hussy. &quot;Your conversation ain’t exactly spar
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>kling either, if I may say so. And I don’ told you I don’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>how many times, that I work in Hospital Communications, not
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>journalism. You don’t listen, that’s your problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>We stood squared off for half a minute. Staring each other
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>down. I wasn’t going to give an inch, I was ready to stand there
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>all day if need be. But finally, it was Cedella who turned away
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>You ever seen somebody punch the air out of a paper bag? Thats
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>how the girl’s face just—collapsed. I felt a little sorry for her,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>but hell. Hadn’t she asked for it?
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;I know l’m not being a good hostess. I’m sorry. l’ve been

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>face. Forgive me for talking too much.&quot; She grabbed my hand.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>&quot;Come, we’ll go to the Underground City. You’Il like it there.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I followed behind her, feeling a bit miffed. She’d gone anc

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>She stopped us at a bench in front of a little corner market
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>just off the wharf. An old man in a plaid cap and dirty white
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>apron came out to stand guard over his fruits and vegetables.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>These people be the same everyplace—see some Black people
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>coming and automatically figure you there to steal from them.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Cedella settled her thin butt on the bench, and a little old woman
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>(looking like a pile of old clothes) got up and moved to the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>other end. Cedella patted the space she’d left.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Sit down,&quot; she invited. &quot;We wait here for the bus.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Bus? Can’t we get where we’re going on that Metro?”
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Cedella shook her head. I had no choice but to join her.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Sitting there between Cedella and the unsociable old woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with the suspicious shopkeeper hanging in the background, we
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>waited. Nobody passed, no one came to buy anything, no one
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>said a word. Time might have been standing still. I sat there in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>my wrinkled jeans, my butt sore against the hard bench. Smell
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ing ripe tomatoes, freshly-cut flowers, a breeze from the harbour,

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and the faint odor of cat piss. Which wasn’t exactly what I had
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in mind when Shirley asked me to come go to Montreal.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>&quot;When is this bus coming.?&quot; I shifted on the bench, feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>splinters catch in my jeans. &quot;It’s taking forever.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The thin voice startled me. I’d almost forgotten that old lady
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sitting there at the other end.

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>&quot;A pity. Poor people always have to wait. No other way to get to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>church on a Sunday. You wait and you wait. What else can you
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>do?
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Now me, I sure wasn’t in the mood for no waiting. Turning
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>into a statue, sitting on a bench with splinters in my ass. Shoot,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>for all I know, them old folks could a been sitting there fron
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>time immemorial, waiting on the god-damned bus. But Cedella’s
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>black eyes come to life. Head start to nodding. Something tell
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>me the girl don’t mind waiting. Like to wait, in fact. She pounced
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>into the old folk’s conversation like a cat among pigeons.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Uhm-hmm, uhm-hmm.&quot; She lean across me, focusing in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>on the old lady. &quot;It is a shame, isn’t it? A real shame.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The more pointless the conversation became, the more in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tense was Cedella. Probing the old folks with questions. From
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>late buses to long lines at the butcher shop to the price of vege
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tables. Seem like every word, every gesture was a jewel to that
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>girl. She hung onto the old peoples’ words, hoarding them like
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>nuggets of gold. They loved it, of course. Which old folks
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wouldn’t? They talked happily about the lives they used to have,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>what happened back in the good old days when the world was
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>right. Cedella urged them on and on.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Cedella must a been practicing for that career she loved to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>talk so much about. One in investigative journalism. She had a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>bad Barbara Walters complex. The girl was an expert in med
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>dling, rummaging in the trashcans of people’s lives. Too busy
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pretending to be engrossed in other folk’s stories, she ain’t got
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>none of her own to tell.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>But even as I sat there, congratulating myself on my amaz
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ing insight, something hit me. Me and Cedella, maybe we were
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of a kind.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>If her thing was investigative journalism, then mine was being

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>but it sure would ruin your life. Turning yourself into a pocket

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Well, honey l’m here to tell you. This woman has had it.

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>go into arguments about this. It’s just the way I feel. And at the

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The one thing that bothered me about the whole situation
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>-and this will be hard for you to read—is that it was your

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>often tried to seduce my proud lovely

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>flowers, and wild red roses. The garden
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>symbolized her passion for wild gentle

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>remarked. (This was also her answer to

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>teach
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>TW-I teach classes at the Woman&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>TW-No, it&apos;s a public center for

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>SK- How democratic! Ok, it&apos;s time
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for our game. But before we begin, let
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>me ask you both one question: Why do
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>you want to play Ya&apos; Got Class, Real
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Class? Vicki?
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>VS - My roommate bet me ten dol

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>5K- Well, that&apos;s direct. Let&apos;s hope
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that&apos;s a lot. Terry, what about you?
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>TW-I’m playing because I can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>afford to lose.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>o SK— Well, I can see you take this
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>very seriously. It’s going to be quite a
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>game. Now, you’ve both been briefed
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>backstage on the rules of our game, but
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>let me refresh your memories. These are
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the rules: [She unrolls a huge scroll, 15
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>feet long, crammed with type in small
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>print. She holds it up for just a few
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>seconds, then rolls it up again J. OK, got
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that? Remember, if you break a rule you
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>can be immediately disqualified at the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>discretion of our judges. Good luck to
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>you both. Only one ofyou can wind up a
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>winner, but everybody gets to move
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ahead on Ya&apos; Got Class, Real Class.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>We’ll toss a coin for who goes first.

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>be the first to answer this question
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>about your racial heritage. Tell us, has
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>there ever been any non-white blood in

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>yourselves. For our next question: When
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>you were growing up, what was your
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>father’s career? Vicki, what was Papa

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>VS- Dad was a bartender.

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>friends are bartenders. Terry, here’s your
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>chance to catch up. What was your
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>father&apos;s profession?
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>TW- He worked in a gas station.

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and useful jobs—I mean, think of a

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>—but not very high scorers. Your fathers’
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>trades don’t rate a step ahead. You both
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>have to stay where you are. Audience,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>give yourself points for that question.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Moving on to our next question: Which
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of the following best describes your
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>mother? Number 1, Humble Housewife.

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>unfortunate strike against you that your

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>years. We’ve decided not to penalize
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>you by asking either of you to take a
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>step back. Just stay there. Really,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>though, we’ve got to get moving or our

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>question: When you were a little girl,

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>speaks:
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>My dad was an only child, deserted by
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>his father when he was eight years old
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and raised by his mother. My grand
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>mother was a god-fearing woman who
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>believed in hard work and the American
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>dream. She spent forty years of her life
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>typing documents for the federal govern
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ment. My mother and father met at
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>church. My mother’s parents never liked
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>my father. He wasn’t good enough for
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>their daughter. They had specific ex
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>pectations for their daughter: she was
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to marry a respectable man at a respect
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>able age and carry on their aspiring
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>traditions. But in 1956 my mother got
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pregnant. She quit school, got mar
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ried, and gave birth to my brother when
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>she was sixteen. When I was born in
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>1958, my father was driving a tow-truck.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>He also drove a cab and worked at the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>steel mill, changing jobs frequently
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>but always working for long hours at
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>low pay. That left my mother to take
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>care of us kids and deal with the bill
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>collectors. We moved eight times before
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>I was five, mostly because of evictions
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>for not paying the rent. We never owned
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a home, and I never had a real bedroom.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>We finally settled in a one-bedroom
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>house when I started school. My brother
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and I had rooms in the basement, no
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>windows and just curtains for doors.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Dad began bartending then, and he
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>joined the union. With both kids in
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>school, Mom started working at the su
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>permarket across the street. She joined
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the union.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>With two incomes our lifestyle im
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>proved. We got a washing machine. I
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>got to go to camp. I got braces on my
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>teeth, and started skiing lessons when I
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>was twelve. The high school I went to
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>included a lot of territory in its bound
			</p>
			<pb n='92'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>aries, and I met kids from all walks of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>life. Most of my friends had more money
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and their fathers had careers. I learned
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to lie and told them my father managed
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a bar. That made a difference in how
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>they received me. My wealthier friends
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>turned me on to a lot: I went sailing in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the San Juan Islands; I spent a Christ
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>mas in Sun Valley; I learned how to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>water-ski behind their boats and spent
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>my summers in their backyard swim
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ming pools. It was fun but I soon felt
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>out of place in the high school scene. I
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>wasn’t a jet-setter and I wasn’t a jock
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and I wasn’t particularly academic. So
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I transferred to an alternative school,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the kind where contracts replaced
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>grades, teachers were called by their
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>first names, and everyone went around
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>hugging each other. My parents weren&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>too thrilled but I convinced them it was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the latest in education. While I was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>there I tried everything from kyacking

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>do anything I wanted to do with my life.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>But the summer after high school I was

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>That fall when all my old friends went
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>off to college, I was working nights as a

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>TW - My grandparents were teach
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ers, from rural Ohio. They believed in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>education, good manners, and the grace
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of God. My mother dropped out of col
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>lege to get married. She blamed her
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>failure in life on that. Though she di

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>port. We moved to Detroit to live with
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>her parents, and she got a job as a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>typist. Her life’s dream at age 24 was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that I would go to college and have a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>career, and not be stuck in a dead-end
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>job. My grandparents/bought me toys
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and clothes, little extras my mother
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>couldn’t afford. She remarried when I
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>was five. My stepfather, Mac, left home
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>at 14 to work in the auto factories. He
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>met my mother when she was a typist at

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Mobil station. My grandparents disap

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>would be a bad influence on me. My

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>hood, so I was registered at a school
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>under my grandmother’s address, where
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>I could get a better education. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>smart. I loved school. I saw my brains
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>as my ticket to success. When I was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>older, Mac bought into a Shell station;
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my grandparents cashed in a life insur
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ance policy and loaned us money for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the down payment on a small house in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a &quot;nice&quot; neighborhood. But we never fit
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in. My mother couldn’t go to the bridge
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>parties and church bazaars. She
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>worked! Mac got dirty at his job, and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>rode a bicycle to work. He swore pro-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>fusely, and never had any inhibitions
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about telling people off, especially when
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>he was drunk. I was ashamed of him. I
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>made sure people knew he was my
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>step-father. I learned how to be very
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>polite. Still, some parents didn’t want
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>their daughters to play with me. And
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I wasn’t allowed to play with some girls,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>if my family perceived them as more
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>lower class! My rich friends took for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>granted things I couldn’t imagine: vaca
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tions to exotic places, music lessons,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>owning a bicycle, or going to camp.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I got my first job at 15. I worked as
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>a mail clerk, a babysitter, and finally
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>at the local McDonalds. This gave me
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>money to buy nicer clothes. In high
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>school, a lot of the kids from the sub
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>urbs were into socialism. They looked
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>down on me for not wearing ragged
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>jeans and workshirts like them. After
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>high school I won a scholarship to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>college from Chevrolet. I was disap

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>where my smart friends were going.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>College was unreal! I worked as a wait-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ress while I was in school. I got politi

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>it in the middle class. But around other
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>working people, I felt like I had to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>pretend not to act middle class.

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>VS- My dad always told me never
