				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It seems to me that coming of age is a coming to consciousness
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of one’s own history and one’s place in history (the future, as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>well as the present and the past)—a difficult kind of conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ness to come by in a society that would erase history; in which
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we, especially women, have to unearth our history before we
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>can go on to understand it.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>What our editorial project has been about in this issue is the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>notion that this coming to consciousness happens in particularly
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ripe and loaded moments, where the diverse experience of our
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>everyday lives seems capable of being connected—where a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>larger understanding becomes visible, even imperative.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Art is an additional arena where this kind of connection can
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>be attempted. And the process of making art, it seems to me, is a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>form of excavation and notation, of bringing to light the rich ma
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>terial of daily life and then reordering it—placing it in a different
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>frame in order to see more clearly what’s really happening there
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>(where it came from and where it may lead), and then going on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to realize something new
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>In this issue we’ve had the good fortune to be able to gather
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>art that speaks directly to those moments of consciousness that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>could be called coming of age, and thus we have been doing our
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>own form of archeology, of recording, and for us this issue’s
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>publication might itself be considered one of those ripe
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>moments.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It was snowing as I walked up the hill for the first time to hold
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the first session of the poetry workshop I had contracted to do in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>a nursing home. I could feel the snowflakes melt on my cheeks.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>When I came into the large room several pale figures swaying in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>wheelchairs awaited me. Some dribbled. Many seemed asleep. I
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>began to speak of the snowflakes and of how, in my childhood, it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>seemed to me that the first snowflakes of the season came on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Thanksgiving. I began talking this way out of nervousness. What
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was I doing in this place, with these people who seemed so alike
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and unresponsive?
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The workshop produced poems such as:

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Though they had this “dread disease” of being aged, I realized
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that these people were me, you, everyone. They had led varied

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>designers, parents, lovers, you name it. They wrote of all these

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>birthday. Having always thought of myself as somewhere arounc
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>forty I wondered how it all sneaked up on me. And if I am sixty
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>then my children are almost forty and... Good God, how did
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that happen??
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Suddenly I felt compelled to look back, review the past, ap
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>praise the present and think about the future, which for the first
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>time does not seem to be forever. What were the traps and pit-

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>good and bad? What have I learned and where am I now?
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>It has been revealing and rather like watching an old film. I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>think that, in my case, the film-like feeling is the result of a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>wrenching break in my life after thirty years as an artist, wife and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>mother. I had spent that life with single-minded passion as an
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>artist while grappling with the logistics of holding a career and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>family obligations together, and suddenly I was plunged into the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>life of an older single woman living alone in a new environment,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>New York City, without any preparation for what I discovered
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was a very particular way of life. I was married at twenty and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>went from my father’s house to my husband’s house. I didn’t live
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>alone until I was fifty years old. I discovered that superwoman
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>has no clothes. I had to learn to live alone. Now I have some dis
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tance, more perspective. It has taken time to achieve this.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Changes have taken place within the family in the last few
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>years. I have become a grandmother and my children have be-

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>active life. But they have, by their own admission, reached an
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>other plateau, become more fragile. While I am coming to grips
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with the awareness that they will not be here forever, my chil
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>dren are looking toward their own children, their education and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>upbringing. And I, without the traditional partner that fits into
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the traditional family pattern, am somewhere in the middle. I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>may never again be as free as at this moment.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>A game of musical chairs is going on. When my parents die, I
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>will move into their place and my children will move into mine.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The buffer of denial will have been removed. It is something to

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Aging is full of paradoxes. I look out upon the world through
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>young eyes, unaware of the physical changes which I do not see.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>At the same time, while feeling ageless, I find myself regarding
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>those much younger than myself as from a great distance. I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>surprised that when I go to the bank, to the doctor, to a lawyer,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>that most of them are the age of my children. It all seems so sud-
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>den, although of course it is not.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Life is continuously surprising and I try to be realistic but not
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>cynical, to rely on my inner strengths and sense of purpose and

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>cruelty. I have to keep my eye on the inner design of my being, to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>know when to hang on and when to let go so that I don’t miss the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>unexpected and wonderful. I have become a “woman of a cer

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N001'/>just became fifty years old, which is looked upon as advanced middle-age by our
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N002'/>youth-glorifying Western society, but was considered to be at the peak of life (at least for
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N003'/>men) by many ancient cultures that respected age and associated it with wisdom. There
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N004'/>is good reason for this difference in attitude: when changes occurred at a slow pace, the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N005'/>young could only profit from the experience of their elders, and tradition was venerat

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N007'/>solete, and young minds can master fresh information quicker—and move on faster.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N008'/>Personally, I tend to agree with the Ancients, and am quite impressed that I have
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N009'/>managed to live half a century. Although the decline is fully in sight, I feel almost as
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N010'/>youthful as when I was twenty-five. I can climb up steps with no more loss of breath;
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N011'/>can make love as well (although less frequently, for being too busy and constantly ex

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Already, before reaching forty, more
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>white hairs appeared (soon too many to

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and have to cope with dentures
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>A part of my body that has aged most
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>noticeably is my hands. Already, when !
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>was in my late thirties, they had started
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>having a few brown spots that turnec

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sign of arthritis, I thought. A year later it
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>was gone, but in the following six or

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>become crinkly much earlier). In the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>While my breasts still do not really hang
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>(there is hardly a wrinkle under them,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>even at my thinnest), the bones of the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sternum and adjoining ribs begin to stick
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>out a bit under the skin. Also, my entire
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>flesh and skin respond to gravity consid
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>erably, which is most visible when I am
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>doing yoga in upside-down positions. All
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>this may be partly the result of having
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>lost weight: since my mid-forties, I have
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tried to stick to 106-108 lbs., to keep the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>belly down, instead of my earlier 110-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>112 lbs. One has to look more dried-up if
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>one wants to avoid the matronly figure.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>However, on the whole, keeping trim
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>has further advantages. I feel more agile,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>more comfortable in my clothes, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>have much less cellulite and “culottes de
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>cheval” on the hips.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>&quot;I seem to be aging by the day this
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>year,” I recorded in my journal when !
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>was forty-two. That was perhaps exag-

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>the past couple of years. Special disaster
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>areas are my neck, eyes, and lately the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>lower parts of my cheeks. Since the early
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>forties, my underchin has permanently
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>acquired two thin wedges of loose shin
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>hanging from the chin to the top of the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>neck; and in the last few years the front of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>my neck looks faded and saggy almost in
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>all positions. Already in my late thirties,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N048'/>the delicate skin under my eyes at their
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N049'/>inner corners had become more faded
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N050'/>and puckered, and the compound hori

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>my early forties, the middle area of the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>eye-socket over the upper lid started get-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ting more baggy, especially when I am
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tired. Most noticeable of all, the radiating
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>wrinkles at the outer corners of my eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>(“crow’s feet”) are now much more nu
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>merous, longer and deeper, especially
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>when I smile or laugh; and, since the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>early forties, several thinner wrinkles
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>have developed vertically across them,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>as well as diagonally downward from un
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>der the outer corners of the eyes—all
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>much more intensely there when I wake
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>up in the morning.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Most disturbing to me, both because
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>they worsened recently and I find them
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>more disfiguring, are the changes that
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>occurred around my mouth. The lips are
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>still substantially unaltered (although
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>usually dry from exhaustion), and I have
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>no radiating little wrinkles around their
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>perimeter yet; but two rather deep
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>grooves have formed from nose to chin
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>along the mouth (in a different way on
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>each side!). These lines, quite visible
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>since my forty-first year, are greatly due
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to pillow pressure during sleep, I am
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sure, because they are much more
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>present every morning. Tiny vertical
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>crinkles between nose and cheeks, also
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>most visible when I wake up, prove that,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>too. Worse still, starting at the same age
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>but intensifying over the last year, the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>flesh of the cheeks on either side of my
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>chin has sagged, creating two distinctly
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>baggy areas that spoil the formerly
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>smooth oval shape of my face. I almost
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>feel the weight of the flesh when I talk, as
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>if my mouth has lost its earlier mobility
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and flexibility, and the effort it takes to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>move the lips, in order to articulate or
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>eat, causes them to form unwanted
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>grooves on the surrounding skin. In
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>deed, as far as I can see myself in the mir-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ror during daily activities, I think that
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>grimaces which used to look cute, such
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>as pouting, now look unpleasant be-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>cause of skin coarsening; and even my
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>smile has lost its sweetness due to the in
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>creased wrinkles under and around the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>eyes. When I laugh with genuine amuse
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ment, however, my face seems to look as
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>pleasant as before.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>All my described changes have been
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>more or less gradual, yet I feel that I have
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>aged in the last year or two more than in
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>an entire decade: my forty-eighth and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>-ninth years have been the hardest of my
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>life. Aside from heavier-than-ever work,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>which was rewarding but extremely de

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ther-in-law died after a sad period of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>near decrepitude; my best friend (having
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>survived cancer of the uterus and, at the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>age of 72, two operations for artificial
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>hips) fell down twice, in the autumn and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the following spring, and broke her right
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>hand each time; my second best friend
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>died after prolonged cancer; our country
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>house almost got burned in a forest fire;
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and I damaged both of my wrists in a taxi
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>accident and, after months of pain, had to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>have two consecutive operations. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>not that one’s body gets older and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>weaker as one approaches fifty. More to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the point, one’s relatives and close
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>friends start dying or getting incapaci

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ously (because it feels nearer) real old
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>age and death. In fact, much of the fear of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>aging is due to fear of future suffering,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>decrepitude, loss of one’s normal capaci-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ties and resulting uselessness and loneli-
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ness. One cannot know how much
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>control of self one will have, and how
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>much dependence on others, if there are.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>any others who will care enough, let
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>alone the threat of economic insecurity
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that most people feel about their old age.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I certainly am terrified of the possibility
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of becoming totally incapable of tending
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to my basic physical needs; I consider
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>such existence below human dignity and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>unworthy of prolonging. Yet nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>seems to want to die at that stage. It looks
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>as if when one becomes almost a vege
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>table, one’s expectations from and per
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ception of life change accordingly.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Anyway, at the age of fifty, I feel in
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>pretty good command of my capacities
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and, so far as I know, in decent physical
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>condition, except for not being able to
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sleep well and having gotten somewhat
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>far-sighted. For the moment, the latter is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>my only tangible handicap, having ap
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>peared at the age of forty-five. It has be

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>cannot read with pleasure any longer,

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>except in bright sunlight), but it still is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>more of a nuisance than a problem. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>quite irritating to have to hunt for your

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dued restaurant lighting. My sleeping
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>problem may be due to the extraordinar
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ily stressful conditions of my life in the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>last years. However, it may also be due to
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>menopause. As I had my uterus (though
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>not my ovaries) removed at age forty
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>four, I do not know when I entered
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>menopause. I started having occasional
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>periods of hot flashes at night (never se

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>from cancer—and they since have re

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ceived any other effects of menopause,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>unless poor sleeping is one (because it
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>has often accompanied my anxiety when
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I wake up at night), and a slight depres

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the result of the recent emotional
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>strains). In any case, my sexual drive has
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>not changed much, other than being
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>affected, as always, by hard work
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and worry.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Most of the problems of middle
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>age are, in fact, related to sexuality and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the fear of loss of it. Men are afraid of los-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ing their virility, which is not only a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>source of pleasure, but also of power
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and prestige. In past societies, when re
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>production of the species was a matter of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>survival and more sons were needed for

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the ability to inseminate. For the same
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>reason females were outcast after fifty, as
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>worthless reproductive machines
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Women do not fear the loss of sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>drive, since they do not need a crucial
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>mechanical event (such as erection) for
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>sex to occur; but they are afraid of losing
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>their power of attraction, and, indirectly,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the pleasure of sex and any control over

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I am not trying to reverse stand
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ards of beauty related to youthfulness in

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>examine the matter objectively, because
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I (and others) have often perceived
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>beauty in middle-aged and even very old
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>faces. A mature elephant or lion is the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>prime specimen of its species; a mature
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>elk or bull is more imposing than its
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>equivalent youngster; and old plane
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>trees or olive trees, with their convo
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>luted branches and gnarled barks, are
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>more satisfying formally to the human
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>eye than immature trees of the same
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>kind. So ifI manage to remove the stigma
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of age, then perhaps I can look at the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>present changes on my face as structural
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>alterations (the rearranging of features
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to an extent) which have produced a dif-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ferent face. One can try to look at one’s
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>new face as if one were a stranger who
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>had never met the earlier self. Then per
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>haps one would not perceive it as

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>However, even if accepted standards

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>(which in fact I wasn’t), or frowning
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>when thinking or reading (vertical wrin

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>l’ve lived. When I went to work at fiftyish,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I found I was better educated than most

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>You’re overqualified.” But if I have to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>make a living, it’s my decision whether
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>l’m overqualified for a job. If you want to

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and love em and cuddle ’em. I was sit

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to a little girl who was quite disturbed.

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>change. We like it the way it is. A friend

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>by old people. This meanness is fear, and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that brings out cruelty.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>I was very popular in my forties, when
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>I became single. The men who thought I

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and established themselves in their pro
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>fessions and had no responsibilities, so
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>they could take me lots of fun places and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>do nice things for me. But an older

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>used to look at myself in the mirror and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ask, how did I change on my birthday? I
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>didn’t see any difference, but men must
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>have a special built-in detector and they
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>don’t want women over 50.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I don’t like being old. There’s no good

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>good as I once was, l’m better. Wisdom.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>That&apos;s the main trick to growing old with
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>grace. When I talk to older ladies, I listen
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to them. I come home and I think about
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>what they’re saying. Issues I cared more
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>about ten years ago? Dusting, I hate

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>My advice to any young person: Enjoy it,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>baby, cause life is so precious. In just

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>as old as Iam. I think it s the fact of having
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>teenage kids. They keep you feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>young if you’re around them a lot. The
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>eight-year-olds, they’re so full of that
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>overbearing energy they have, so much
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>get-up-and-go they can’t be still. Talking
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to my grandmother is restful, peace-of

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ferently, I guess to make them feel more

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Once upon a time I couldn’t deal with
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>people unless they were just like me. I
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>can get along with anybody now. Like

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>You see, I was a quitter. I preach to them,

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>traveling we did together. I didn’t miss

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>might have gone for one, but I don&apos;t

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>often think about that, but the way I was
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>brought up, I was very happy raising a

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>without a real career. If I hadn’t had

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>again, ’cause it’s so pretty. But you can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>bring those things back.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>good society to grow old in. They don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>let you stay alone. We don’t even have
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>nursing homes. They let their parents
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>stay home with them and they care for
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>their parents. Older women are treated
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>with great respect. They can tell you sto
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ries, history, have some good interesting
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>facts to tell you. My grandmother can re-

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>sand, and that’s how she can tell how old
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>she is. In my eighties, l’Il go home and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>stay there. Here, older women try to look
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a little younger—makeup, exercise. At
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>home old women tend to stay old. It’s so
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>different from here. When I get old I’Il
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_9_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>just go with the time. I’m not scared of

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>life. My children are 14 and 12, and I talk

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>way I talk to my own friends, casually,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>though not as in depth. I’m perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>more polite with women over 70. Some-

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>have to watch the inflections. Youth is
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>looking at a vastness, 60 or 80 years
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ahead. Older people are looking behind
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and thinking there’s this much time left,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>this is what my life bas been. Where they
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>kind of meet is in living day by day, week
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>by week. Middle-aged people live year
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>by year, not day by day
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The economic situation looks bad. We
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>could even have a real depression like
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the 1930s. It seems like there’s going to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>be a re-evaluation of our lives and what
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>we can provide for our children. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>look at a real rosy future but I think it will
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>be a real political time. Ten years ago,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>there were a lot fewer advocacy groups
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>for older people, Gray Panthers, senior
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>groups, and now theyre much more ac
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tive politically. The middle-aged groups
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>will continue to be active and they’ll be
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>stronger as they see what’s going on and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>demand that things will be there for
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>them when they get old. The youth is
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>also getting much more aware of the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>whole cycle of things. My son’s in ele

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>They say that by the year 2000, a third
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of our population will be over 65. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>huge. There are people considered sen-
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>iors still caring for their parents. The 85-
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>plus age group is the fastest growing age
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>group. And we’re going to have to sup-
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>port them with social security. Then it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>supposed to be there for you and me? I
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>know an 80-year-old woman trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>care for her 60-year-old daughter who
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>had a stroke. She’s back to being a

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>with it now. So we’ll have four genera-

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>to be very powerful. Who knows what’s

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>five years ago, and as l’ve processed that,
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I don’t really believe very much in goals

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>talking about her hearing all the time.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>And then once in a while I see her as a
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>person and I get all fascinated because

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>forward to getting older because I bope

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>more fun. But I also know that when you
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>get older than that—maybe after 40, the

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>could have imagined. That’s why it was
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>such a shock to get to be 35.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Sara: There’s this thing about men get

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>older. Well, I think older women are
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>classy. You have more perspective, more
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of a sense of humor about things, or
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>some people do. It’&apos;s more and more
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>gentle and carefree if you’re in touch
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>with getting older. I’m looking forward

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>That’s really silly. I think gray hair’s beau

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>around 70. I do have young friends. If I

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I think of them as quite young. If I meet

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>as good to grow old in as some, where

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>prejudice out there, but until it hits you,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>you don’t think about it. The main thing
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>l’ve woken up to from my own experi-
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ence is how people are prejudiced
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>against me because l’m a woman. I’m just
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>beginning to realize that what they say
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>we have and what we really have are two
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>different things. When that happens, it
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>makes me look around and see other
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>people who are put down because of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>what they are
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>I think less about certain stupid things
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>than I did in my teens, like popularity,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>physicalness, clothes. The social things
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>start to mean less and less, what people
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>think of me. My grandmother’s 88 now.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Just a fewyears ago, when she was still all
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>with it, old age meant happy things to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>me. It meant knowing things nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>else knows because you ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>through everything, a whole lot of infor-
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>mation rolled into one. Your face
			</p>
			<pb n='20'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>changes, but I never thought wrinkles
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>were bad. If you looked one way your
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>whole life, it wouldn’t be any fun. Now,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>when my grandmother’s mind is getting
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tired, old age looks a little scary to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Getting old can be like going back to two
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>again, just regressing all of a sudden, and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>there’s nothing you can do about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I have a lot of intergenerational con-
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tacts. I waitress with women from,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>mostly, 30 to 35, and they’re actresses. At
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the offices, the secretaries are about 35
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to 45 but they’re a whole different kind
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of person. It’s probably the hardest part
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of a woman s life. There’s nothing wrong
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with being a secretary, but when they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>typing for someone 21 with her own of-
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>fice ... They maybe didn’t do quite what
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>they wanted. The actress/waitresses may
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>be doing what they want to do but just
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>not making it. That’s scary too.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>A lot of people in my classes are
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>women over 65 because we have a huge
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>program at Marymount called “lifelong
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>learning. I like it a lot, going to school
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>with older people. At first I didn’t, be
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>cause they’re so excited to be there they
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>can be pains in the neck. They say, like,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;What? No class today? Well, when are
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>we going to make it up? What’s the home-
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>work?” They want to learn so badly; they
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>want to go home and have something to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>do. And l’m, like, oh my gosh, don’t they
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>know you’re supposed to do the least
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>possible to get through in this world? So
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>I get a lot of energy from them. At school
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>they’re the most exciting people to be
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>around because they know so much.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>They’Il say, &quot;In 1929 when the stock mar-
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ket first crashed, it happened like
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>this....
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>I don’t spend as much time with little
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>kids as l’d like to. I always wanted to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>teacher and then I decided that was al
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>most demeaning in our society, espe
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>cially with younger children. But at work
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I make sure I take all the projects at the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>elementary level, so I get to talk to a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>younger kids about what they want to do
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with their lives, to keep kids in school,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>teach them at an early age where they&apos;ll
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>be if they don’t stay in school. What I
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>want to do some day is teach law to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>young children.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>There&apos;s nothing I miss from adoles
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cence. I was a misfit. High school was a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>waste of my time. But maybe it helped
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>me grow up much faster. I was happiest
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>from birth to four. You know who your
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mommy and daddy are, but you don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>know wbo they are yet, and that’s good. I
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>always say I wish I was five again—no,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>four, because you don’t have to go to kin
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dergarten when you re four. You just
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>woke up in the morning and everything
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was happy Every day seemed so long.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Going to bed was horrible. Now I dream
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>all day of getting to crawl into my bed
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and the days seem so short they just
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fly by.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I think my happiest years are yet to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>come. I&apos;ve got everything planned out
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and I get very frustrated if things don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>happen on time. I leave nothing to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>chance. As soon as I can pay back my stu
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dent loans, I want to go to Columbia Law
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>School. Marriage and kids? I go back and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>forth on that. One day, I can&apos;t wait to find
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>somebody who’ll be my best friend and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>satisfy me for the rest of my life. Other
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>days, I think there’s nobody out there
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>who thinks like I do. My mother always
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>told me, Marry a doctor, marry a lawyer,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>have a good life.&quot; In other words, don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>tbink for the rest of your life. What else
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>are women here for, anyway? Another
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>piece of me totally throws it out the win
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>dow. Okay, l’Il get married when I’m 55
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and l’ve done everything I wanted to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Maybe l’Il want to share some of my
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>riches.&quot; But I want to do everything I do
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>as me, as Jennifer Albert—A-L-B-E-R-T
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>because that&apos;s what l’ve been spelling on
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>my papers my whole life.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>People always say old age is a state of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>mind. I don&apos;t think so. People just like to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>think of it that way It&apos;s an age, it starts at
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>65. Old people in this society are just
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>pushed aside. We give them discount
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>coffee at McDonald’s, discount movies,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>like that’s all they’re worth. I would love
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to live in a society where being old
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>meant you knew more, you were up
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>there, high on the totem pole. Instead,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>we put our old people in little hospitals
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and visit them now and then. They
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>should be able to go on living like they
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>always lived. If something’s wrong, of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>course they should be helped, but a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of times we help them without them
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>wanting to be helped. I’d leave them
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>alone. Like with the homeless. In Amer-
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ica we just like to sweep all the people
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>we don’t think we need under the table.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I think l’m going to like being older.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>l’II know more. I just can’t wait to know
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>so much that when anyone walks up to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>me I can have an intelligent conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with anybody in the world, know a little
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>about everything. I hope people will take
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>me more seriously when l’m older. It’s
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>hard to be trying to do all these things
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and people keep telling me, “You re
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>young; you’ll understand later.” Maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>l’m wrong to think I know now, but I
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>don’t want to hear that anymore. I want
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to get to the point where l’ve done all the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>things I want to do so I can relax a little
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and enjoy it. At 55, l’Il be able to sit back
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and think, “Thank God, when I go to that
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>high school reunion, l’II have things

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>his life, and now to have his fingers broken by a dude who askec
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>him the time of day at eleven in the morning made him feel like
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a fool, so he was hurt two ways—in his fingers and in his spirit
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>It won’t make any difference,” he told Thelma. “They can tell
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>you’re old by the way you walk.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The fear changes everything. It spoils things, takes the fun
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>away. It makes one think of danger when one never did before
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>That’s a neat hat,” this guy painting the side of the building
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>yelled at me and I was pleased. I like men to think I look good so
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I said, “Thankyou.” And he said, “And what’s under it looks gooc
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>too.&quot; My walk undoubtedly swayed a bit more than before and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>laughed, felt fine in a little rush of pleasure, then, whop,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>thought, “T’m alone here in this space with this man, and ever
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>though he’s grinning and is being so friendly, he may not be
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>what he seems. And all the delight disappeared, all of the little
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>trust and lighthearted bit of foolery we’d had together was gone,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and I lowered my head and hurried away, feeling both afraid anc
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>disgusted with myself for feeling that way.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The fear is the worst part, and the surprise, because I certainly
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>never thought I would be living in a society where my mother
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>would have her throat cut at the age of 87 or that I would be
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>afraid to go out alone at night at the age of 65. In fact, I even
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>thought of inventing what I called a “Pop Up Man, an inflatable
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>plastic creature, like those dinosaurs the Nature Company
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>makes for kids, that I could put in the seat next to me when.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>drove up to Santa Rosa for my night classes. Maybe it’s not a bad
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>idea at that. I am very proud of the way my mother handled her
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>horror but she stopped driving after that; she was afraid to go out
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to the car where it had happened.
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>See, there it is again. That it happens in the most ordinary and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>unexpected ways, in the bright simple light of day, not in the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>fearsome dark of the night. Someone asks you the time at eleven
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>in the morning. Mom was going to the driveway of her house,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>into her car at two in the afternoon. She got into the front seat of
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the old Chevy, closed the door, and the guy grabbed her by the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>hair, yanked her head around so they faced each other eye to eye
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and pulled up this straight razor and slashed her neck. He
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>missed her jugular by a half-inch, probably because my mother,
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>like all of the rational British middle class who demand explana-
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tions from life, opened her mouth to ask, “What do you think you
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>are doing, young man?
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>So, the fear is based on reality. Old women are injured and
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>robbed, as are old men. Our society does not respect age, does
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>not teach and train for the idea that it is despicable to take advan-
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tage of a weaker person; on the contrary, our dominant morality
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>seems to be saying, “Go for the sucker. Bomb Libya. Kill Quad-
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>dafi’s kids. Invade Grenada. It’s just a little island full of weak
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>blacks with no guns
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The fear is not foolish. Caution is wise. Dye your hair. The Pop
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Up Man is probably to be on the market soon. My mother lives
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>behind barred windows in the little house where we all grew up
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and no longer drives her car. I have not yet tinted my hair but I
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>try to walk assertively and I rarely go out at night and I wear a hat
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>more than I used to. It is definitely time for a change and the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>responsibility for that change lies with us, with women. We must
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>spearhead the change because we are the ones who suffer the
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>most from the present situation. Easy to say, hard to do, but we’re
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>thinking on it and thinking hard. It is bad enough to be old but to
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>be old and afraid is awful.

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>along and no one ever knew. After all,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Mrs. Eva Boa was an old woman. God
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>only knew how old she was. Before she
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>went crazy, she had been a very normal.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>quiet lady. A neat, small grandmother of a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>person who seemed to live alone, she
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>could occasionally be seen doing her
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>marketing at Hicks Deli or carrying her
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>laundry about the street in her old-per

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>always turned slightly up. She was a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pleasant, gentle-looking woman and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>therefore completely uninteresting to

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We were, then, in need of expanding
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>our understanding; frankly, we needed a

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ally not tired at all, we lingered, not
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ready to go home. I watched Virginia

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>now clung too closely to her, while I

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that rolled down my damp arm. In the

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>lets of sweetness. I tugged at the midriff

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>down on a small spot of moist grass, the

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>surprisingly straight, her hand on one of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the hips where her little bulk had accu-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>mulated, the tiny, elongated breasts lying
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>against her bony chest. Under her spell, I
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>forgot all about the two boys behind me
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>perched like lifeless gargoyles on the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>railing, as I watched the smile that Eva
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>had always threatened burst into a wide,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>empty grin, devoid of teeth or even
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>dentures.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Virginia, Diana, and I stood up to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>gether, connected by some invisible
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>string that drew us toward Eva as well as
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ourselves. The night began to feel like
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the dark-blue velvet of the stage curtain
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that hung in the old school’s audito
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>rium—something that was being pulled
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>aside for Eva’s debut. I think we might
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>have clapped, yes, I think we had stood
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>up to give her a standing ovation when
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the giggle came from behind us.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>At first the noise seemed to lose itself
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>in the thickness of the air, to get muffled
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in the warm velvet that was cloaking us.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>But the intrusion persisted, became
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>loud, dramatic, pushing its way through
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and finally tearing down the curtain
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>from around Eva’s stage—leaving her ut-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>terly naked—and forcing us to turn away
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>from her. We looked at Adam and Mi
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>chael, once again wearing their Tshirts,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>as white as the robes of priests, looking
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>like their old selves again, as they stood
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>up on the railing above us, defying its
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>edge, pointing at Eva’s window and
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>hooting.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_l' n='N024'/>Look at those titties, Adam
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>bellowed.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>&quot;And look at, at—” Michael broke off,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>grabbing his stomach in a fresh release
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>of laughter.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>Like a strand of beads cut from a wom
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>an’s neck, the string between Virginia,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>Diana, and me broke and scattered us at
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>the boy’s feet, small smiles stuck on our
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>faces as we lapsed into the shadows of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>the railing. I tugged at my knotted shirt,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>trying to cover my cold and clammy mid
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>dle. I watched from the side how Virginia
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>hunched like a vulture and folded her
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>arms in front of her. Diana simply looked
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>at her feet, smiling that smile of idiocy.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>Who started first? I don’t remember, but
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>gradually the three of us shuffled toward
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>the boys’ pedestal, forming a half-circle
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>around them, throwing in our hesitancy
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>for the comfort and relief of laughter un-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>til we were all in full swing, together
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>again, laughing—at Eva. The pitch in
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>creased, increased to the point where I
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>thought for sure something would give
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>way, and finally I yelled, “Hey, we better
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>get out of here. Somebody’s coming,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I think.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>My words were a marble aimed at the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>center of the group. We were dispelled
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in every direction, still giggling in that
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>nervous terror. Down Colombia
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Heights, up Hicks Street, across Monta
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>gue. We ran back to those homes—those
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>safe homes that we had recently been so
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>loathe to return to—all because this
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>crazy woman, out of her mind (of that we
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>were now certain), was brashly grinning
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>her huge vacant 0 at us through her
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ground-floor portal as though it were
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>some kind of promise.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>but Eva was something to be reck-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>oned with. At first it was just our secret.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Every evening, through some intrinsic
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>understanding, we would meet the boys
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>at the same spot and watch Eva’s nightly
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>show. Because we got used to the sight,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>we got brave, and each night when the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>unveiling occurred, we stayed on the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>street corner a little longer, risking the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>wrath of our parents for violating our
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>curfews and risking God (or Loony Luke
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>maybe) only knew what by remaining to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>take in what Eva offered us. Adam led the
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>assault on the menace—for I suppose
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that is what it had become for us: that
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>perverse version of femaleness which
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Eva presented—using profanity with
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>moderate proficiency. He and Michael
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>practiced, in the language that would
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>carry us through to adulthood, lewdly
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>poking and jabbing at Eva, sharpening
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>their horns by finding inventive descrip-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tions for all that she displayed so
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>proudly: the sagging breasts, the broad
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>hips, the flabby belly, the furred, soft
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>growth in the middle of it all. Virginia,
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Diana and I found our niche in the affair;
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>we stood behind the boys egging them
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>on, laughing—oh, always laughing as if
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>our lives depended on it—at each insult
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>so that we were all truly bonded together
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>in what had become the greatest of
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>thrills.
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>But Eva continued undaunted, un
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>abashed in her vespertine ritual; our se
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>cret meetings and the business
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>transacted became another something
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>that was comfortably predictable. We be-
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>gan to dare, double dare, triple dare
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>each other—the stakes were high—to
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>move closer, go beyond the limits we
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>had set for ourselves. Finally it was
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Adam, the most brave and fearless of us
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>all, who accepted the challenge, or
				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>rather, assumed the responsibility.
			</p>
			<pb n='26'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>On the evening that Adam took mat-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ters in hand, the rest of us hid in the for
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sythia bushes, long since gone green,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that bordered the edge of Eva’s small
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>lawn. The distance from our vantage
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>point to Eva’s window could not have
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>been more than ten yards, but nonethe-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>less Adam’s journey seemed impres
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sively long as we watched him stealthily
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>make his way across patches of grass,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>darting from tree to shrub, pivoting
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>around a sprinkler; he was a regular G.I.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Joe. In the meantime, the rest of us hud
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>dled close to Michael. As Adam moved
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>closer to the window, Eva’s light re
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>flected off his features, giving identity to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the small, dark prowler. He was directly
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>underneath the window ledge when he
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>craned his neck back to see what was in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>side. At that moment, an irretrievable
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>moment, a strange look—an indescrib
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>able impotence—grazed the boy’s glis
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tening face, transforming him from an
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>intended hero back into a child, a very
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>frightened child. There was a quickening
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of our hearts, perhaps it was just my
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>heart, I don’t know, perhaps no one else
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>even noticed the hesitancy. Perhaps I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>imagined the whole thing, or perhaps it
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>was just a gloating moment before an in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sured triumph, because in the next in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>stant, he reached up and forcefully
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>banged on Eva’s windowpane and then
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>just as quickly tore away, keeping low,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>until he dove into the sanctuary of the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>bush. Adam had returned to us victori
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ous, and the laughter of conquest, of re
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lief, to which we had become
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>accustomed, spilled out of us like hot,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>uncontainable lava.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>&apos;You did it!&quot; The words sput
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tered out of us mechanically, but no less
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>enthusiastically, as we congratulated
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Adam. &quot;You did it.” Virginia was the first
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>to say it, and then each of us began re
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>peating the words, like a dull chant. “You
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>did it, you did it, I can’t believe what you
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>did,” said over and over in rasped whis
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>pers. To confess? To convince? Some
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>thing else? Well, I don’t know....
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>But I remember Adam’&apos;s response to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>our chorus: “I don’t think anybody saw
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>me. Did anybody see me?” in a breath
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>lessness that made me wonder even then
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>what kind of a question that was to ask
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>during a victory celebration. But none of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>us would admit any dissatisfaction with
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the moment. That the event had been of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>short duration didn’t disturb us, didn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lessen its intensity. Not really. And none
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of us really thought about Eva after it was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>over. After all, she was the given in the sit-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>uation. I remember looking at her one
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>last time after Adam had done his deed.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>In response to the intrusion, Eva had
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>bent her head down, and the big round,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>toothless grin lost its turned-up edges
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The contentment, the pride, that had
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>filled her face and frame vanished as her
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>eyes searched the darkened lawn for her
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>caller. She stared vacantly, both hands
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>helpless at her side, the O becoming big-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ger, becoming her face. Becoming her.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Eva stopped coming to the window
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>after that, so our business with her was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>finished. Loony Luke took on renewed
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>importance in our lives. He had taken to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>wearing his toga at half-mast (we sup-

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>guessing he was covering the boils that
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>would eventually leave him legless). We
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>would taunt and tease him as he deliv

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>church, always counting on a strong re
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>buttal from him to put us in our places.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>One day, for the sheer terror of it, Diana
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and I sneaked up behind Luke during the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>climax of one of his speeches and furi
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ously hurled a stone at his wall of a back.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Luke turned, woolly sunken chest bris
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tling, and chased us all the way down
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Joralemon Street. I remember hearing
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the rest of the kids laughing as we ran
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>away. Laughing at Diana and me.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>But summer ended and junior high
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>began; the curtain of one season
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>wrenched closed, another’s torn open.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Halters and midriffs had been cast off in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>favor of wool dresses and first nylons, in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>appropriate for the weather that was still
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>warm. I looked for changes: the occa
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>sional pair of shaved legs or the touch of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>forbidden lipstick. Virginia, Diana and I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>cowered together, trying to ward off the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>hard glares of the older students who oc
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>cupied the central schoolyard, the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>younger, like ourselves, having been
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>forced to the periphery.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>It was a terrible feeling, standing in ex
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>clusion, knowing the contempt the older
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>girls had for us. The feeling was terrible
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>in its newness, even though deep down
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>we had known what to expect. We did
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>our best to combat it by talking about
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>having a locker for the first time, having a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>homeroom, having to take a shower after
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>gym class. I watched Adam and saw how
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>he, in his group, was doing no better
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>than we were. He, too, had been rele

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>those of his own kind—skinny, chicken
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>necked boys whose freshly clipped hair
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>had deprived them of all the vitality of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the past summer’s influence. Seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>them as they were—that was the biggest
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>betrayal, to my mind, the biggest insult. I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was feeling like I was ready to do any-
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>thing, anything to put an end to the way I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>was feeling, anything about this injustice
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that had been dealt to me, when Virginia
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>brought up the subject of Eva Boa.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;Sophie, she said to me, “T heard my
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>parents talking last night. You’ll never
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>guess what. You know Eva Boa? Well,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Mrs: Boa’s daughter had to come from
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Westchester to get her and take her away
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>from her apartment.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>I didn’t want to here it. I had myself to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>worry about. “Well, so what, so her
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>daughter came,” I said.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>&quot;Don’t you want to know why””
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>No. I don’t care.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Virginia went on, compelled. “One
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>night, she stuttered, one night the po
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>lice found her running around on the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>lawn without any clothes on. Naked as a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>jaybird. All the lights in her apartment
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>were on and the front window was wide
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>open.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>My rage doubled back on me like
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a hunted fox. The three of us bent our
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>heads and studied the dirt embedded on
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the concrete where we stood. I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>what I wanted. I wanted my two friends, I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>wanted the three of us to pick up that in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>visible thread and restring ourselves and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>walk arm in arm out of the schoolyard,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>away from all of it, all of them. I suppose
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>what I was looking for was a second
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>chance. Finally, I dared to ask, “Well,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>what happened?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>The police called her daughter and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>she came down and got her.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>&quot;But, I mean, what will happen to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>her?
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>&quot;My mother says they’ll put her in a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>home in Westchester. My mother says the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Boas have lots of money.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>I was relieved by that. Virginia contin

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>says Eva Boa had gone crazy and that it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>for her own good that her daughter is
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>putting her away” Virginia turned her
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>head and looked at me hopefully.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Yes, that’s right,” I assured her. “Eva
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Boa was just a crazy old lady.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>The bell rang and we forgot about Eva
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>and the summer that had just ended. I
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>stopped looking at Adam and the other
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>boys in our class. I stood behind Diana
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>and Virginia and watched the older boys
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>and everyone else line up at the door.

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>In the year 1974, unknown to me at the time, physical
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>changes which were completely out of my control conspired to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>disrupt the lifestyle which I had planned for myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I was newly married. l’d successfully completed four years of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>college and had landed a job as a music teacher in a school dis
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>trict within driving distance of my home. After my first year of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>teaching I was married, in June, to Paul, who was a businessman,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>environmentalist, and social activist in my hometown. I thought
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the course of my life had been pre-ordained. I was going to be
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the typical ’70s woman who after about three years of marriage
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and the purchase of a new home, would begin raising a two
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>child family while still retaining a profession. I hadn’t really
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>stopped to think if this was what I wanted, it was simply what I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>would do; it was what my contemporaries were doing.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Then, in less than the span of a summer vacation, I was forced
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to deal with changes and realities which could never have been
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>predicted. The entire course of my life was changed.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>After much testing, I was diagnosed in August of 1974 as a vic
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tim of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a somewhat
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>uncommon disease of the immune system which may affect ma
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>jor organs. It commonly attacks young women. There is no
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>known cause, and although there are various therapies being
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>used, there is no cure. Symptoms vary from person to person. At
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the time of my diagnosis, the physical changes in my life were
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>minimal, which in some ways made mental adjustment more
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>difficult.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>It is terrifying to slam into your own mortality and to be told a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>disease may be life-threatening when the physical changes are
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>negligible to non-existent.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>It was almost as if I were speaking of a third person in discus
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>sions with my doctors or my husband. There was supposed to be
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>this sick person, but it couldn’t possibly be me. Other than a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>chemical diagnosis, I was as functional as l’d ever been.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I did the only thing that was reasonable under the circum-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>stances: I denied its existence. The only tangible consequence at
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that time was a request from my specialist that I postpone any
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>plans for pregnancy for a couple of years until he could see what
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>course the disease would take. I hated the word ’disease’; that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>word should be reserved for sick people. The request concern-
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ing pregnancy did not even ruffle me, because it seemed to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>temporary thing, and I hadn’t really planned on children so early
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in my married life. So, although intellectually I knew there was a
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>problem, emotionally I had not yet begun to deal with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>For two years I was able to completely deny the existence of
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>SLE because it had little impact on my physical state or my life
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>state. Then in the spring of 1976, I experienced a radical change.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>The change had been occurring physically since January, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>had been frantically and successfully denying it. l’d become very
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tired most of the time, had lost about twenty pounds, and I was
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>suffering from bouts of arthritis, nausea, and headaches. I’d re
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>fused to face reality, which in hindsight makes me appear very
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>naive, but I was convinced it was simply overwork, grad school,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>job, marriage, househunting. I’d promised myself a lengthy
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>summer vacation to settle down and set things straight. Summer
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>vacation never arrived. I could no longer walk and was hospital

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>My prognosis had changed somewhat. I was now living

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>disease, and more intensive and varied diagnostic procedures
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>revealed extensive kidney involvement (acute nephritis). I spent
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>about a month in the hospital. I was put on extensive medica

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tion, mostly cortisone and immunosuppressants, and there

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tests being administered daily There was a tremendous decline
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in both my mental and physical states. After an exhaustive month
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of this therapy, I was released into my husband’s care, with the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>admonition to remain strictly on my medication regimen. They
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>could not make me well. This time, in my depressed physical
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and mental state, I was forced to face some ugly facts. I really was
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the victim of this insidious chronic disease for which was known
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>no cure nor cause. This disease had attacked my vital organs
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>(kidneys), therapy did not seem to be working, and many peo
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ple who had been in my situation were now simply statistics.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Certainly there was hope that the therapy would take hold and a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>remission would occur, but to me that hope was a distant one.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>In addition, all sorts of restrictions were placed on me. It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>very hard to deal with physical limitations, and I had rapidly de

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>short of breath, fatigued, and depressed.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The things I was being told I remember vividly, and they hurt

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>once again not to even consider a pregnancy, and to seriously
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>think of giving up my job. I did not want to be economically de
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>pendent on anyone, even my husband.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>My first reaction, I think, was a tremendous fear. For the first
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>time in my life I was possessed by an all-consuming fear, primar-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ily of death. Every day I wondered if maybe this was the last, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was certain l’d never see Christmas.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Secondly, I became overcome with anger and bitterness. I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>didn’t really deserve this, l’d worked hard, according to the pre-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>scription for success; it was supposed to be my turn to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>reaping the rewards of that labor.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Finally, and perhaps most important, from today’s perspec-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tive, came an overwhelming feeling of sadness. Despite the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>grumbling I was frequently prone to, I really liked my life, and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>everyone in it. It was the first time that I had seriously consid
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ered this fact. With this last realization began a dramatic change
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>in myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>I had much time for introspection and I came to the realiza-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>tion that the people who surrounded me and my relationships
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>with them were far, far, more important than the trappings of life
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>for which I had been striving. I had finally come to realize that
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>people and relationships, not money and possessions, are the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>real stuff of life. At that point, and I think it may have been partly
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>conscious, partly unconscious, I began to try and live by the old
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Do unto others” adage. When you are really on the bottom, ma-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>terial things cannot add to or create happiness, but people can;
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>people had made my life worth taking very seriously.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>At this point, I simply bottomed out. For some reason, and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>it&apos;s still unclear whether the medical regimen had begun to take
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>hold or my own body had garnered its strongest defenses, the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>disease went into a period of remission, and my life began to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>return to a more normal state.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Things would never be the same; the course of my future had
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>been irrevocably altered. I would learn to cope. I gave up a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>steady job. I learned to squeeze every hour out of every day
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>when my health was in a normal state. l’d been told to avoid ten-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sion and fatigue, supposed triggers of my disease. I became
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>much more tolerant. For me, tolerance was a method of dealing
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>with tension. I found it helpful to force myself to stop and put
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>events into proper perspective; frequently l’d find that these
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>events were not as important as they’d appeared on cursory ex
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>amination. I’d always been a high-energy, competitive person; l
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>learned to harness the energy, and sometimes put aside the
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>competitive spirit. I learned to slow down and ruminate on
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>smaller events.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Over the ten years following diagnosis we lived a yo-yo life.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>There were quite a few bad flare-ups of the disease. In between I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>did manage to run a small retail business, obtain an M.A., begin a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>local arts council. We purchased a ramshackle old property, and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>turned it into a picturesque horse farm. T’ve learned to drive, as a
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>hedge against the day when I may no longer be able to ride. We
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>still have no children, and I may never again hold a full-time job.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>We do have a very full life, though. Both Paul and I are heavily
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>engaged in community and environmental concerns, and music
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and horses remain an important part of my existence.
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>They have still not discovered a cause or cure for SLE, but
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>advances have been made in both diagnosis and treatment, and
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>research is ongoing. As is the case with any serious disease there
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>are risks and trade-offs to any therapy undertaken. I was last hos-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>pitalized about two years ago. It was, I feel, the hardest time l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ever had. Once again my body, my immune system, had turned
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>on my kidneys, attacking them and treating them as foreign ob-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>jects. My kidney function decreased radically, I became symp
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>tomatic, and very ill. Treatment which l’d been on did not seem
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to be working. The decision was made to go to I
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>will not reiterate the horrors of chemotherapy, but suffice it to
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>say that it lives up to its reputation. Yet, I am grateful to chemo-
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>therapy; it seems to have temporarily caged this demon inside of
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>my body. I feel that I finally have come to acceptance. We still live
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>under a constant shadow, but realize that life can be worthwhile,
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>under almost any circumstances. Having had this to deal with
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>has made me more appreciative of others, and through every
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>single bad time, I have been reawakened to the fact that there are
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>very many caring human beings in this world. l’ve had to fight
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>alone because it is I who carry this disease, and it is my will
				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>which must make the decision to fight, but my strength is possi

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>disease has made me gratefully aware.

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>their actions, their looks, carry reflections of myself, I
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>am overcome with an almost unbearable anxiety. No
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>woman, no one, should have to so externalize herself,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>should have to live in such total availability. Nothing is
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>too much to do for these women.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>l’ve been very aware that this is the visit I was supposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>make when I took the job instead. Naomi is disappointed that
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Michele doesn’t like me: wants her mother and to nurse. Naomi
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>keeps telling Michele that this is HER mother, who used to nurse
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>her as Michele is nursing now. Michele looks at me doubtfully
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and sucks away.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Yet anything I do has to be an act of will because, un
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>reasonably but certainly, I am afraid that I may again be
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>come such a mother-thing. I do not think I could
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>survive.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Naomi half believes that these kids understand her. Three
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>temper tantrums have been created with Charlie already, in
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>which every effort was made to give the child some rational rea-
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>son for a conniption fit, some place where the parent is at fault.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Hell, the kid’s been trying to get you to contradict yourself or at
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>least say NO for a full hour and a half.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>What can I do to unstress this situation? I retreat to my trailer.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>But they want the sense that we have lived through all this to

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>this new irrational child as we perhaps did not understand but
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>did live through the experience of the earlier one
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/> Iam not so afraid when I am alone with the grand
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>children: perhaps because old patterns take over and I

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>go back to their parents in a little while. But when they
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>go, the fear is there, lurking. My very bones ache with the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>pain of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I want sometime to tell you about the horrendous fight with
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Naomi which has just coughed forth the crucial fish bone in its
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>throat: SHE remembers very well what I did/said before she
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>went out into the storm the decade before the decade before
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>last: I WOULD not stop telling her about car accidents in storms.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Naturally, this explains why she went out into the worst blizzard
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>we experienced in twenty years with a thin coat, no boots, no
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>money, sayingshe was never coming back as long as she lived (to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her sisters, who, no doubt, debated for several minutes be
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>fore deciding to tell us, at which point it was, of course, rather
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>too late).
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>And I feel guilty. These new daughter-mothers are my
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>children. They are also my friends. I am jealous of that
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>friendship, hard-won, out of their growing and my own
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>latency.I don’t want to play roles now, old roles that have
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>not been questioned or redefined. But my daughters
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>have not the energy—I have not the courage—to invent
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>new ones.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Naturally, this explains why she ran away from home in the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>blizzard when she was ten, but does it explain why she contin
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ually threatens her three-year-old with leaving forever, and mak-
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ing sure that I hear her doing it? And why she tells him that HE is
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>welcome to leave and find another family at any time; she hopes
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>he does? Although she doubts he will find anyone who can stand
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>him?
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I feel guilty. I cannot play the good-grandmother role.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>My mother played that role for me. She kept my children
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>when I went on vacations; I always knew she would help
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>if things got too desperate. She played her role well. I
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>don’t know if she felt terrified as she played it. I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>guilty because I never asked.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The guilt of mothers and grandmothers being what it is, it
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>probably does. I, apparently, who was twenty-three when she
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>was born, have more responsibility for Charlie than she does,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>who was twenty-seven when he was born.

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I remember once, when my children were nearly
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>grown, Mother came to stay so I could go on a trip. She
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>preferred to keep the children at her own house where
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>she knew where things were, shops were familiar, and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>friends telephoned all day long; but my children were
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>no longer interested in Grandmother’s house. So Mother
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>came to me. The children, caught in the explosion of
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>their adolescence with tasks of growth and reintegra
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tions Mother could neither understand nor appreciate,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>had no time for her. She could do nothing for them.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>When we returned, my independent, my elegant mothei
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was waiting tearfully at the door in a crumpled cotton
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dress. Ihad not realized until then that Mother was grow-
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing older, that the world was becoming increasingly in
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>comprehensible and hostile for her. I never discussed it
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with her, and I never again left the children with her. Of
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>course, I feel guilty.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>At this point, they have been on food stamps; Rob has been
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>unemployed for over a year. They weren’t even collecting unem-
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ployment insurance, and, in job interview after job interview,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Rob was the runner-up after the person they probably had had in

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I am the grandmother now. It is much the same; and
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>it is very different. My mother would never have said any
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of these things I am saying. She could not have imagined
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that anyone could share them and not condemn her, for
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>she lived in a time when women shared tasks, shared ex

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that includes child care and tuition for two (two children, two
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>adults). I guess it blew Irma’s mind, too. In the meantime, far

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>pers, and wonder what the world is coming to. (Even though I
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>know they have no water for washing diapers part of the year
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>even though I know it would not be acceptable to send the kid to

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>give up Pampers before you go on welfare.) One of the things I
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>said to her that she hasn’t mentioned, but I knew in my heart
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>wasn’t right and would rankle, was that if I looked in France for
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>those 920, all-cotton jump suits for Michele, I would like her to
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>promise to use one of the (totally unused) bibs I know she has
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>when she feeds her in it. Naomi doesn’t use bibs or playpens;
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>she doesn’t want to trammel her kids. (She also doesn’t see to it
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that Charlie gets a quiet space at naptime.)
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Teanwhile, they stand knee-deep in children.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>They are fire towers and wardens, lighthouses and keep
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ers, rotaries and traffic cops, and they must have a little
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>time to return to their empty houses, to answer their
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>own bells. If I can’t mind the children while they do,
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>we’d better figure out who can.
				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>I found dozens of garments in a ragbag which had nothing the

				<lb facs='#facs_35_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>baby clothes, that there were dozens of people scouring the bins

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>woman, who writes poems about the solstice. The poet was at the hairdresser. Since the
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>poet is blind and deaf, I decided not to announce my presence and visit there, but wait
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>until she got back to her room, where at least I could be present with her, and she might
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>feel the afternoon sunlight at the same time.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>So I lurked about the door to the hairdresser’s hangout, leaning on it and making
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>it clear to myself that I could escape if I needed to.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>In seasons’ shipwreck
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Mother, you and I,
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>caught at luncheon
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in the window’s bay,
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>family faces like a fortune
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>deck, and say,
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>While I was there, a lot of wheelchair people sort of rolled themselves about in their
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>chairs near me, or fell asleep, or got wheeled a few yards by somebody or other. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>very haphazard. No one was going anywhere.
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I noticed some things. The hair had grown very long on the legs of one lady. I
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>thought it was nice they didn’t insist on shaving it off. Lots of people had very strange
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>skin. I thought about how the skin looks on my left foot since I poured boiling water on
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>it last month.

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Anyway, this one very clear-eyed and purposeful woman rolled up and halted by me.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>“Where am 12” she said. I said I didn’t know. Where did she want to be? She said, “I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>know. I don’t think I have a home. Do I
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Noon’s shiny surface
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>starts to crack.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Children
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>too young to marry,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>too old to haul
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in their perambulators
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>call me back.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>could see I was in for it. “I don’t know,” I said. “What’s your name?” (Thinking I
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>could go and ask.) She didn’t know.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>“I can’t remember,” she said. “Tve told them so many different ones. l’m over a hun-
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>dred,” she added. Not true, l’m sure. But she looked very thoughtful, and the above
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>conversation took perhaps five, perhaps ten minutes.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>You need not be alone.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>You have your telephone,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and friends,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and odds and ends
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of wintry springs.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>You have...

			<pb n='38'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>So I tried to think of how to deal with this home of hers. Especially since
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>she thought nothing was left any more, and I had been selected as the likeliest
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>hope she had of finding out where she was and where she was going.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I seized on the rings. She had two, and they were rather large and flashy. One
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was a diamond not unlike my mother’s that she sold to get my brother out to Cali
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>fornia. She said her two sons had given it to her. And the other, she said, was from her
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>grandchildren.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N008'/>Until
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N009'/>“That’s a sort of home,” I said with firm cheer.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N010'/>the seasons stop again
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N011'/>She was thinking about that when a very spry oldster, who may well have been a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N012'/>hundred, judging by her wrinkledness of skin, pulled up short by the wheelchair of the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N013'/>homeless one.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N014'/>“Hello there, Elsie,” she said. Then, “I can see you don’t remember me. I remember
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N015'/>everything about everybody, and nobody remembers me,” she said, to nobody, really,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N016'/>and cheerfully enough.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N017'/>When
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N018'/>Somebody else came by, being pushed by an orderly. “I was just on my way down to
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N019'/>see you,” Spry said. The orderly tried to turn her burden over to the spry wrinkled one
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N020'/>who was on her own two feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N021'/>“Oh, no!&quot; she said. “I can get about myself, but I don’t push anybody!
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N022'/>you will call me home
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N023'/>When I got my poet out of the hairdresser’s (her name is Vida Townsend), she
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N024'/>said that she wrote all fifteen of her poems in a two-three year period, (her daughter told
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N025'/>me only after she became blind) but that she hasn’t written any for about two years.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N026'/>and
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N027'/>“T’d like to write one more,” she said,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N028'/>will come.

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>wanted to hire paraprofessionals to

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>cluding one woman who was radical and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>very nice, but a lot of them were really
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>very hard to deal with. One doctor came
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in one night when I had a 16-year-old pa-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tient who was nervous about the specu
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lum, and he said to her that this wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>any bigger than what had gotten her
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pregnant. We got him fired. Another
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>night, I had an American Indian patient,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and you always are supposed to say,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>&quot;Doctor Blah-blah, this is Mary Sue, she’s
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>from blah-blah. So I said, “This is Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Sue Whatever, and she’s from X tribe,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and he said, &quot;How.” I’m not kidding. You
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>know, you’re fine, the patient’s fine, and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>you’re dealing with idiots who are not
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>used to having to talk to patients as peo
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ple. One doctor used to put his foot up
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>on the table when he did the examina
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>tion. Another doctor would loudly count
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the fetal parts, so you would go over and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>try to talk over him or shut him up. All
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the counselors began to feel that we
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>stood between the patient and the doc
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>tor, that in addition to helping the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>woman through a difficult part of her
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>life, helping her get an abortion and then
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>go back to her town and get birth con
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>trol, we were having to protect her from
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>the person who in fact was there to give
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>her the abortion. So it was really hard.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Before Dr. Harvey left, he made us a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>big Christmas party, and he gave us all
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>hams. There was this big table of food,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>and he had put the instruments of the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>abortion out as serving pieces. He had
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>the speculum in the potato salad, and the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>pinchers that everyone was upset about
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>because they were really painful and we
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>were always having to say to the patient,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>You’re going to feel a pinch”—he had
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>them in the olive jar. It was obscene. We
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>took the instruments out and washed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>them off. So there was a pornographic
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>aspect to some of these men. At a certain
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>point, some of the doctors got to brag-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ging about aborting a bigger fetus. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>like a competition between the doctors
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in a really perverse way.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Actually, a lot of the doctors were
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feeling upset the way we were feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>upset. It was very hard to be doing this,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>but they had no mechanism for handling
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>their feelings. One doctor had a dream
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in which there were fetuses stretched in
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a line from San Francisco to New York. A
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>lot of the doctors were experiencing a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>certain kind of guilt. Another doctor
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ended up opening up a sex therapy
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>clinic; he believed that an abortion
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>should be painful for the woman to expi
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ate guilt, and he actually gave a very pain-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ful abortion. We tried to get Dr.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Nathanson to deal with these problems,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and he wouldn’t even listen. We did
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>manage to get a few doctors fired, but we
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>also wanted there to be therapy sessions
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>for them so that they could talk about
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>their feelings and not have to do these bi-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>zarre things. But no, it never happened.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>So we became very confrontational with
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the doctors.

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>COUNSELOR
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I got the job because I had met some
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>artists who were part of the Artworkers
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Coalition, and someone said, “Oh,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>theyre looking for counselors at this
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>abortion clinic,” so we just went. It
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>wasn’t like I thought about it; I just went
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to the interview. At the time they were
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>looking for women who had had abor
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tions, and in the very beginning they
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were also looking for women involved
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in the feminist movement. This all
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>changed, of course, but that’s how it
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>started out. So I got the job, and realized
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>afterwards that I actually very much
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>wanted to do it. I had been very secretive
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>about my own abortion and never
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>dreamed I would use it as a job
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>reference.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>At the beginning, none of the peo-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ple who worked at the clinic were
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>nurses, and we were all young. I was in
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>my late twenties. There were two other
			</p>
			<pb n='46'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>artists, one woman had been a showgirl
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and had dropped out of the Weather-
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>men, and there were a lot of women who
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>had political experience in the women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>movement.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The counselors did everything. We
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>had a five-patient daily load. We spent
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>about an hour and a half with each per
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>son; you met the woman, you talked to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>her about how she had gotten pregnant,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her problems, and you counseled her
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>about birth control. The experiences
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with the patients remained wonderful
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>throughout. We met people from all over
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the country, all kinds of women. Most of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the time they hadn’t told anybody or
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>they’d told maybe one person. We had all
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>been through it, and I think we all felt a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>great need to give support in a situation
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in which we hadn’t had support. Also, we
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>were in positions of authority, and so
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>many of these people were very heart-
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ened to learn that, yes, we had had abor
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tions ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>First we explained the abortion proce-
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>dure to the woman, because she would
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>be awake. It was the vacuum method, so
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>she received a local anesthetic. We
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>helped her get in the room, we took her
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>blood pressure and her temperature,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and we presented all the facts to the doc
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tor. Then we went through the abortion
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>with her, so in fact we assisted the doctor
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>at the actual procedure.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>After we had witnessed so many abor
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>tions, we knew exactly which doctors
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>were good and which weren’t. So then
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>we had this situation where we had to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>describe the procedure differently to the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>different patients, depending on who
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>was working that night. There would be
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>three doctors on. When your patient was
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ready, you would go out in the corridor
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and put your number up, and whenever
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>a doctor was ready for another patient,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>he would put bis number up on a board.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>If certain doctors would be on duty, you
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>would just hang back and keep check
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ing—everybody did it—waiting for the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>good doctor to put his number up, and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>then we would all rush out trying to get
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>him. It was really hard when you knew
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>that some doctors were not going to do a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>great job, and it put us all in a terrible
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>position.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>If a patient was too far along in her
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>pregnancy, she would have to go to a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>hospital for a different procedure. A
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>number of people were taking patients
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>home, getting them a room in Bellevue,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>giving a fake address. Everyone was
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>overdoing it, because we had the feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>that this was the woman’s only chance.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>We all had been through illegal abor
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>tions, so everybody felt that they would
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>do anything to help the patient. But al
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>most none of us worked full-time. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>think you could have, actually; the cumu
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lative effect of having to deal with the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>clean-up of the abortion was very hard
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>for all of us, and the other thing that be
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>came hard was dealing with the doctors.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>People also started getting a little
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>flipped out and began having trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>about their own birth control. One of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the counselors later had two abortions;
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she wasn’t using birth control. Another
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>nurse who was a counselor with us had a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>theory that if you made love a lot, you
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>lowered the sperm count. So that’s what
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>she and her boyfriend did, and of course
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>she got pregnant. I had an IUD put in
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>during this period because I just didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>want to think about birth control, de
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>spite the fact that I would see patients
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>with the Dalkon shield. I didn’t get the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Dalkon shield, though I did later have
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>trouble with my own IUD. Everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>started having trouble after a while, cu
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>mulatively, and you would do emotional
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>things to kind of block out your
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>experiences.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>We later felt that it would have
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>been better for the workers if we’d had a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>woman’s clinic with more of a balance
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>where you were delivering babies, you
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>were doing abortions, you were caring
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>for old women. I think it remained good
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>for the patients, though. We still had
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>those wonderful moments and conver
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>sations and relief and crying.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I left the clinic in 1972, and it closed
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>down almost a year later. I couldn’t deal
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with it anymore. It was just too much for
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>me, really. I quit about eight months after
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we got the union. I was a delegate, and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>they were upset when I quit, but I just
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>couldn’t do it anymore. I just needed to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>paint. I took unemployment for six
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>months, and then when my friend
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Georgia quit, we started doing
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>housepainting.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>After I had left, some right-to-life guy
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>came to the clinic. By then we had a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>private guard, because violence against
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>abortion clinics had already begun. This
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>guy evidently burst through the waiting
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>room doors and ran into the patient re
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>covery room, wanting to baptize the fe
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tuses. But one counselor, who now has
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>her own karate school, formed a phalanx
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of counselors with herself in the lead
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>(they had called the police, who weren’t
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>coming) to keep this guy from getting in.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>They succeeded.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>You have to remember that the people
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>who worked there were very political at
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the time. A few counselors quit in the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>very beginning because they couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>deal with the procedure, but then those
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>who stayed, stayed, because the longer
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>you stayed, the more you felt like you
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>couldn’t leave everybody Though we’d
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>started out fairly idealistically trusting
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the administration, we quickly found
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that the situation was very problematic,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and when we decided what action we
			</p>
			<pb n='47'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>were going to take—that we would or-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ganize a union—everyone felt sort of ob-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ligated to each other to stay throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the whole thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The clinic was small, always; pro-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>bably the whole place was a hundred
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>people, including the nurses. There may
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>have been fifty of us in the beginning. We
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were all women except for the doctors,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>who were all men except one, and of
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>course the men controlled the abortion
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>procedure. Most counselors were part-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>time workers. I don’t think anyone
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>worked five days; most of us worked
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>three. You had to work at least two. It
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>wasn’t huge, but we worked two shifts.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>There was the eight-to-four shift, and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>then I worked four to midnight. It went
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sixteen hours; there were two sets of
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>doctors. The shift I worked, the doctors
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>would have worked all day, and then they
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>came in and moonlighted. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>making a salary of 8350-8500, which was
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a lot of money for one night’s work. I
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>worked eight hours three days a week,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and then we had all those meetings on
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>top of it. It was my whole life for about
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>two years.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Deciding to form a union and affiliate
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with Local 1199 didn’t seem like a radical
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>choice at the time. We had considered all
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>kinds of other options. 1199 had never
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>organized an abortion clinic—obvi
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ously, no one had done it. We were an
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>odd crew, various ilks, but we were all
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>doing this job. It took us about six
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>months to organize.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Anyway, as soon as we started, the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>management got very crazy. They had al
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ready accused us of being mercenary.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Many people at Judson Memorial Church
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>thought the only problem with abortion
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>was that it had been illegal, and now that
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>it was legalized, they could speed up the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>pace and we didn’t have to spend so long
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>counseling and could do it more effi
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ciently. What we felt was that they basi-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>cally wanted to turn it into a mill.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Just at the moment when we finally
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>had most of the group ready for the elec
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>tion, the clinic started hiring profes
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>sional nurses. We later learned that the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>administration had wanted to hire peo
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ple who were hostile to women’s libera-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>tion. They had also wanted to create a
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>wedge between us by saying we were
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>not professionals and they were profes
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>sionals. But of course, we trained all
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>these people and we all did exactly the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>same job. The National Labor Relations
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Board then said it was against their rules
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to have professionals and nonprofes
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>sionals in the same voting category. So
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>when we had the election, the nonpro
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>fessionals won the union and the profes
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sionals were not in it. Of course, when
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>we negotiated our contract, they got ev-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>erything we got, and after they had
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>worked for a while, a lot of them ended
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>up agreeing with us.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I helped negotiate the contract. We
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>didn’t ask for pay raises, because at that
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>time 850 a day was a very good salary. But
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>we fixed a five-patient limit per coun
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>selor per shift, and we wrote into the job
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>description what we actually did—that
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>there had to be counseling, birth control
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>information, the whole thing. The ad
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ministration was very upset about it, and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>about a year after I quit the clinic, it evi
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>dently shut down and opened again as a
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>runaway shop with society women vol-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>unteers. Now the clinic is gone entirely,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>but we did succeed in organizing it dur

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>THE ABORTION
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It’s a very simple procedure. It lasts
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>about five minutes. There’s a painful part
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in the beginning when the doctor grabs
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the cervix with these little pinchers that
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>are like ice pinchers, and it hurts, be
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cause there’s no anesthetic at this stage
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>He—and I say “he” advisedly—he has to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>hold the cervix because your uterus sort
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of floats inside your body cavity, and you
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>have to be able to control the uterus
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>when you’re doing the dilation. Then he
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>applies the anesthetic to the cervix with
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>an injection; Lidocaine is what we were
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>using at the time. This one doctor—who
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I still go to and who was the only really
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>humane one there—developed a
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>method of giving a painless abortion. He
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>would apply the anesthetic in short jabs
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>counter-clockwise, and he would wait
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>about a minute until the cervix was really
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>numb. You have very few nerves in your
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>cervix; it’s like a little pink nose. He said
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>it took him about a year to figure out how
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to do it really well. No one else I worked
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with got this down perfectly, so people
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>always felt varying degrees of pain.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Then they used a series of dilators.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The dilators are like pencils; they’re
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>stainless steel, they’re like slightly
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>curved long S’s and they’re made in grad-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>uated sizes. The doctor inserts them into
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the opening of your cervix; it’s what
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>opens your cervix up. It’s like pushing it
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>open, then more and more and more.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Sometimes they do it too quickly, and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>they can perforate the wall of the uterus.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>When I first saw the abortion, I almost
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>fainted at the dilators. It was the only
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>time I had trouble, but there was some-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>thing too graphic about some of the in
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>struments that I really found upsetting in
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the beginning. Usually if there’s going to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>be a problem in an abortion, it happens
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>when they dilate you. They’re supposed
			</p>
			<pb n='48'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>to do this very gradually, as your cervix
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sort of opens up. I assisted once for a pa
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tient who was perforated; she was okay
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>later, but it was a horrible experience
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and I had to go to the emergency room
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>with her.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>After the dilation, they introduce a suc-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tion tube, which is like a dilator with an
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>opening, with which the doctor goes
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>around the wall of the uterus. Then at the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>end, they introduce an instrument that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>a little curved wire. It’s a scraper. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the most important part, because he
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>must scrape the whole uterus, and you
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>can actually hear if it&apos;s clean. The patient
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>can’t hear it, but if you&apos;ve heard it a lot (I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>probably assisted at a thousand abor
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tions), you can recognize it. That’s what
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>went wrong for me. You have to remove
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>all the tissue, because that’s where the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>placenta attaches to the uterus, and if it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>not completely removed, you continue
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to bleed into your uterus, and that&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>when people hemorrhage.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Afterwards we would actually have to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>examine the fetal parts to make sure they
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>were all there. It was important to do it,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and after we began to understand all the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>stages of the abortion, we were all very
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>careful to really look, but it was hard for
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>us. They are beautiful, the fetuses, and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>they do look like babies. At six weeks
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>they have the little tails, and at twelve
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>weeks it’s a perfectly formed person. It’s
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>transparent, it’s pink, it obviously looks
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>fetal, but it has fingernails. They’re tiny,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and even though all of us did feel upset at
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>seeing them, there is an enormous dif
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ference between this tiny little fetus and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>a whole baby. Six weeks is about an inch
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and a quarter; twelve weeks is about two
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>inches. Then they get progressively big
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ger. I assisted at an abortion of one
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>woman who was sixteen weeks preg-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>nant—the doctor had obviously made a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>serious mistake.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The six-week fetuses usually come out
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>all together in one piece. Later, you
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>would have to see tiny miniature parts of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>a human body. It&apos;s hard to talk about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>All of us felt it, we all talked about it, we
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>all cried a lot. There was a lot of conver-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>sation and feelings and everything
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>among all the women who worked
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>there, but we also wanted to shield the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>patients. We had all had abortions, yet we
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>didn’t want our patients to know what it
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>looked like. You see everything. They are
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>beautiful, but they are also obvi
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>ously fetal.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Another part of it that was hard was
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>that if a patient was too far along, you’d
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>have to refer her. That was all right, ex
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>cept it meant more money, and in those
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>early days, a lot of the women had barely
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>scraped up the airfare. Most of the time
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>they had borrowed money from people,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and a referral meant a lot more money
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The abortion clinic was about 8200; it
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was cheap, comparatively speaking, but
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>not nothing. An illegal abortion was a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>more expensive—you said yours had
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cost 8400 in the early ’60s.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The later abortions are really hard. If
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>you’re fourteen weeks, you should wait.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>That’s when I had mine, and I hemor
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>rhaged. You have to wait until sixteen
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>weeks for a salting-out; that’s what the sa-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>line abortions are. They inject a salt solu
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tion into your uterus that basically kills
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the fetus, and you deliver it dead. It&apos;s re
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ally hard to go through, and you have to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>stay a few days in the hospital. In the be
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ginning, everyone who worked at the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>clinic felt awful having to turn someone
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>down. I think that&apos;s part of how it hap-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pened with the 16-week abortion: no
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>one wanted to turn a patient down. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>kind of a collusion between our feelings
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of support and the doctors craziness
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>about who was aborting the biggest fe
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tuses.

				<lb facs='#facs_48_l' n='N001'/>
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>At the time that abortion was legalized
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>in New York, it was only legal in two
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>other states: Hawaii and Colorado. So
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>during the two years I worked at the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>clinic, except for the very end, a lot of the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>patients were coming from out of state.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Everyone had a good reason. Nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>had a foolish reason. I’m sure there is no
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>such thing as a foolish reason. You see,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>all the women had considered this in a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>very serious way, but Nathanson had ob
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>viously never thought about the implica
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tions of what he was doing until after he
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>had worked at the clinic.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The ignorance about birth control was
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>really phenomenal. I had a patient who
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>had been taking the pill, but vaginally. I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>had another woman who was practicing
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>rhythm, but incompletely; she thought it
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>was the frequency, not the date. She
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>would do stuffonce a month, but with no
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>regard to when, so the poor thing didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>understand why it had happened. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>there were a lot of people whose birth
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>control devices had failed. During this
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>time we had many, many, many patients
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with the Dalkon shield.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I had about five 12-year-old patients.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The 12-year-olds were really children.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>One patient came from Florida, a very
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sweet girl. Well, she didn’t want the abor-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tion—she really wanted the baby, she
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>loved the baby. She hadn’t had much re
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>lationship with the boy, who was an
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>older boy, maybe 16. Her mother had
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>said she wasn’t big enough to have a kid,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>which of course I agreed with, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>girl felt it as a power thing with her
			</p>
			<pb n='49'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>mother, that in fact she was big enough
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and all her girlfriends thought she was
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>big enough. She had all these plans
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>about how she was going to raise it. So
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we had a long talk, and I said I wasn’t go-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing to force her to have the abortion, but
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>then I asked to speak with her mother. I
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>really liked her mother. She was this fat
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>woman from Florida, and she had been a
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tire retreader. Somehow she had re
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>treaded more tires in an hour than any of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the men had, but they wouldn’t give her
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the award because it would make the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>guys feel bad or something. She had had
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a kid when she was 15, and she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>want her daughter to go through the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>same thing she had gone through. She
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>really wanted her to get the abortion. Ac-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tually, she was a very supportive person.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>It took two days. We waited and let the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>girl think, and eventually I was able to
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tell her mother what I had figured out
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>about her saying her daughter wasn’t big
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>enough to raise a baby. Well, they
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>worked out their personal problem, and
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>she did have the abortion. But a lot of the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>very young women really wanted the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>baby It was like having a doll.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I can’t remember everybody, but I saw
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>all ages, all ranges of people. As I men
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tioned, I probably had a thousand pa
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tients. The oldest was in her early fifties,l
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>would say. One of the people from the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Weather Underground came and got an
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>abortion in secret. One woman had had
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ten kids. She was in her early thirties, a
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>lovely woman. I asked her how she
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>managed it and she said sometimes she
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>just shut the door. She had literally been
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>pregnant for ten years or however long it
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>would be to have all these kids, and then
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the last time it had been about two-and-a-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>half years and it had felt so good. And
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>when she got pregnant again, this time
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>there was an option, and that was sort of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>wonderful. I was a clear choice.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>I also had a patient who was pregnant
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>from a “right-to-life” senator in Utah. She
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>was his secretary, and he was married
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>She hadn’t told him. She’d lied, she’d
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>come here because she felt he would
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>prevent her from getting the abortion.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Of course: he was right-to-life and he
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>hadn’t used birth control and he was
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>running around on his wife.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>There were all kinds of people. I did
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>have a lot of teenage patients who had
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>done what l’d done, basically, which was
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>to sort of hope it wouldn’t happen to
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>them, but most people—it was the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>whole range of every imaginable person:
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>people who were married, people who
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>weren’t married, people who had had
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>kids and couldn’t have any more. A few
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>people really did want to have a kid, but
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>they just couldn’t do it financially. That
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was the hardest part of it. There were oc-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>casionally people who didn’t want to be
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>very open with you, but that wasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>usual.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The only generalization I can make is
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that it was just everybody. It wasn’t like a
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>special case. It was all kinds of people in
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>all kinds of possible situations, who had
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>gotten pregnant and didn’t want to be. It
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was just like us: we were all different
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>kinds of people. The only difference
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was that they could come there and it
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was legal.

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>At the very beginning when the clinic
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>opened, our situation was relatively ob
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>scure. We had our internal problems
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with the doctors, but we didn’t have ex-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ternal problems. But after the 1973 Su

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>there started to be demonstrations
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>against the clinics.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>As a parenthesis, when those judges
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>said something about it being our I

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>even thought their views mattered to me,
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and yet on some level there was a part of
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>me that still felt bad for having had an

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>for two years. I was sorry I had to get

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sponsibly, yet I felt bad. It surprised me
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that I was still so involved with patriar

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>that wasn’t great, despite the fact that this
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was supposed to be a model clinic. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a depressing reality, meeting all those
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women who needed an abortion. We
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>had moments of feeling that people
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>weren’t isolated, but, in fact, everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was going back into the same situation
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that had gotten them pregnant. You also
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>begin to feel, when you have to explain
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>birth control to somebody, that the op
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tions are not great. We all were opposed
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to the pill, because if you just read the
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>newspapers, you knew that you might
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>get cancer. One of the possible side ef-
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>fects to the pill was death. Then there
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was the diaphragm—fine, great.
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>It was really depressing. We had this
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>little model, and we explained the stand-

				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>had done everything right, and it hadn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>worked out. On top of that, you re deal-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ing with doctors who are repre
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sentative—and l’m sure not bad
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>representatives—of the medical estab
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lishment, and you’re having to fight all
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the time. It was very hard for everybody
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>after a time, because you felt that you
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were almost part of the problem, that
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>there was this wave of things that were
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>not solved, and that the whole situation
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was really pretty bad. I think that’s what
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>accounted for people getting burned
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>out. At a certain point, too, even after we
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>got the union and we got contracts, the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>administration still harassed us. I got
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>called in, and a number of people got
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>monitored, and they were encouraging
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>people to quit.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>There was another side to what we
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>were doing, you see. It was 1970 and the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>antiwar movement was going on at the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>same time; it was sort of a fringe aspect of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the clinic. So the clinic had another aura,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and I think that’s partly why Nathanson
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>hated us so much. We represented a dif-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ferent cultural strain. We had all come
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>from different sides of being involved
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>politically on some level in the antiwar
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>movement, the women’s movement, the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>art movement. We all had long hair, you
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>know, and a lot of people had been at-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tracted to this job because it was a politi
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>cal job, a feminist job. Later, of course,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>people came in who were nurses and
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>who had none of that background.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The other day, you were talking
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>about abortion and its legalization in
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>sort of a generational sense, as a coming
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of age for all of us, and this was—it still
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>is—the big issue. It’s a basic issue for any
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>woman’s life, whether you’re going to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>have a kid or you re not going to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>kid. I had an aunt who had a baby on her
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>own, and the baby died. She was living
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>down in the country on the farm, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>had to leave the country and come to live
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>with us because she was so ostracized.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Her life was ruined by this experience. I
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>never quite knew the whole story till I
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>grew up, but I always had intimations of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>it. I loved her. She was the dangerous ex-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ample. So there was all this background
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>when I was growing up that a possible
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>result of sex might be social ostraciza
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>tion and death. My mother told me about
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>some girlfriend of hers who tried to kill
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>herself because she was pregnant.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Because I went to college, I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that there was birth control. A lot of my
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>patients knew, but it wasn’t easy to go to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>an authority, to a doctor—I guess I was
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>afraid of being turned down or was
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>afraid of what would happen. I actually
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>didn’t know how to go. And when I left
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Texas and joined the Peace Corps in
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>1964, people kept saying in the Peace
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Corps training that they would teach us
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>about birth control, which was a big is
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sue, but then they never did. I was this
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>mixture of a very sophisticated and a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>very unsophisticated person. I had read
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>D.H. Lawrence, so I believed intellectu
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ally that it was fine, that I was willing to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>do it, but of course I didn’t know how to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>get birth control information. I actually
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>tried to look in the Bible—I believec
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>there would be some information—the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>old &quot;he knew her and she knew him, of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>something. I thought they might say
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>when was the right time. I thought the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>timing might be in there. I didn’t want to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ask anybody, particularly the girls I had
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>met in the Peace Corps who were from
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>New York and who really knew a lot, be-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>cause I didn’t want to appear too stupid
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>It is a coming of age. It&apos;s about howyou
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>deal with authority and how you handle
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>your own body. When I got pregnant,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>couldn&apos;t find out for sure for a long time.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>My biology teacher at the University of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Texas had shown us a film of an egg di
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>viding, and all I could think of was this
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>egg relentlessly dividing without my be
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ing able to think about it. I wanted it to
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>just wait a minute, so I could think about
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>it, and I knew it was just dividing and di
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>viding like that. It was a horrible image of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>feeling really out of control of your body
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>In a way, it’s like the first realization that a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>lot of things are out of your control.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>You see, I grew up in a family
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>where my father was a union man. He or-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ganized for the railroad. But at a certain
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>point my father ran for head of the union
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>in Texas and he lost to a guy he consid
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ered a crook and who, in fact, was a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>crook. After that, he was in the union but
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>he was never active. This happened
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>when I was about ten or eleven, but I re-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>member that feeling of disappointment.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>It was very exciting and heroic when he
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was organizing, but he sort of gave up,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>you know. And when I went to college,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>we tried to organize our dormitory. I
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>can’t remember what the incident was
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>now; it was something about electing
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>our own floor officers—certain deci
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sions about self-determination, really. I
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>helped to organize the protest move
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ment. We refused to eat our desserts. It
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was very Victorian. I wrote my father a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>letter about it, and in my heart, I thought
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>he would be very proud of me for having
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>done this. But he wrote back and said,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>&quot;Tm going to tell you how the cow ate
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the cabbage,” which is a Texas way of say-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ing, Tm going to tell it to you like it is,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>which is that you can’t win.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>I guess this is part of being out of con
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>trol. I was very bright, and this feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>didn’t touch me for a few years. I went off
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and joined the Peace Corps, and my
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>parents approved of it because I was 21
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and the Democrats were in power and it
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>was right and I could do it. That’s how I
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>left Texas. My father got killed a year
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>later, and I got pregnant a few months af-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ter that. But it was all part of coming of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>age. It’s when you suddenly come up
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>against that part of life you can’&apos;t control,
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and the feeling I had about not being
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>able to control my body was part of
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the whole feeling that things happen
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and you can’t solve them and you can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>stop them.
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>And I guess the feeling of empow-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>erment and also of freak-out at the clinic
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>was feeling that we were trying to con
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>trol it. In fact, we were controlling it, but
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>only a part of it, because we weren’t con-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>trolling the doctors, we weren’t control-
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ling its status, we weren’t controlling the
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>birth control situation, we weren’t con
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>trolling any of these things. In the end, I
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>think I did get more control, but I paid a
				<lb facs='#facs_50_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>price, like you do for everything.

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>as she listened to the old woman press
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ing into her with that voice.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>“She’s apt to have changed a consider-

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>me you’ll say nothing, not one word
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>about that business the other day. No

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The old woman subdued a grunt of
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>disgust and then added in a tight whis

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The girl hadn’t meant for anything to
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>come out, just her mind racing along in
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>response. But, as had been happening
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>lately, the words just slipped from their
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>moorings before she could stop them.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Don’t But grandma me, Annielee!

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>good time, you watch. She tried to stifle
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>a thin smile. “There’s some things even

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>brains don’t help you with, thank the

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>With that pronouncement, the old
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>woman settled into her weight and pre
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tended to look out the window
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>at the scenery whizzing by on the dusty,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>stark road.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Off in the near distance, a pack of dirt

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>a hundred yards away. Neither the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>woman nor the little girl gave them a sec-
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ond thought. The driver, one Harold J.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Wannaker, Jr., didn’t accord them much
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>attention either, other than to snort deri
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sively, or as derisively as possible under
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>present circumstances. HaroldJ., second
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>son, had been forced to forego a per
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>fectly lucrative dry-cleaning venture be-

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>crossed paths. Since that unfortunate in
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>cident, he had been remanded into the

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>brother-in-law Ralph, and now made his

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the work, mostly on account of its lack of

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Harold shouted into the rear seat, where

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in comparative silence
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The girl had originally wanted to sit up
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>front with Harold, seeing as she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>have too many opportunities to ride in
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>an automobile. At least not for this far a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>drive.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Thank you kindly, Mr. Wannaker,” the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>woman said. She leaned heavily to the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>left, squishing the girl, in order to catch a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>glimpse of the driver in the rear view. “I
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>swear he’s starin’ at us,” she had confided
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>as they set out.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>He ain’t interested in us, grandma,

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The sentence died unripe as the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>woman tightened her already iron grip

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>By this time Harold was indeed staring
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>up from his driver’s seat at them. When
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>he met the old woman’s eyes, he smiled
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>quickly, and with a measure of what he
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>would have called “innate charm,” he
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>tried to sound nonchalant.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>You have folks over this way,

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The old woman pretended she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>hear him.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>We’re goin’ to see my Mama,” the girl
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>said loudly.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Well, that real sweet, it truly is. She
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>work over this way, does she?” Harold
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>spoke too loudly for the small, stuffy au
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>tomobile, as if one or both of the passen
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>gers were deaf or a strong wind was
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>blowing from somewhere.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>They didn’t answer him. The sky over-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>head, which had started out foggy and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>chill, began to thaw up a little, as it did
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>most summer days in that part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>world. Little by little, the mist rolled to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>the other side of the bed and the huge
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>billowy clouds marched in over the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>open heavens. The girl, throat dry, stuck
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>her head out the window and looked
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>upward.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Annielee, get back inside this auto
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>mobile this second.” The woman tried to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>tug on the homemade jumper. “If you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>not goin’ behave, we’ll turn right around
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>and go back home.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>The girl reluctantly ducked back in

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>side the automobile and the woman
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>fussed with her braids and collars while
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>she squirmed.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Now you remember what I told you.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>She’s not herself....Lord only knows,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>but anyway, you just try to be on your
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>best behavior and don’t get her excited
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>or... Oh, fix yourself up...
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The girl adjusted her jumper and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>faded into silence. The road veered into
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the small, dinky town, much like her
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>own, much like hundreds of dust
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>marked communities in that part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>world. The old woman protectively
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>touched the bag of fruit which was half
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hidden in her never-ending purse.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Grandma?
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Huh?
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The old woman seemed to find
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the little burg fascinating, and with
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>something approaching delight, she
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>gazed at the shop windows, the people
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>strolling on the sidewalks, the bright
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>marquee over their sole movie theater.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>&quot;Is Mama really sick? I mean, is she
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>goin get well, really get well forever?
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The girl knew what she meant to say,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>but this time when she really wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>say something out loud, her words came
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>out all wrong. Life sure was funny some
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>times. Especially when it came to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>talking.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Honey, only the good Lord can give
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>us the future.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The girl sighed inwardly, knowing that
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>when that name was introduced, she
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>wouldn’t get an answer she could use.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>She gave up and stared out the win
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>dow again.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>They left the town proper and cruised
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>along a tree-lined street. The smell of
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>honeysuckle tangoed with the melons,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tomatoes and cow manure, just hanging
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>in the heavy, humid air. Somewhere,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>quite near, you could just make out the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>outline of several large, sturdy buildings.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>And the road was making a straight line
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>for them.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>The girl started to shiver.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>You catch a chill, Annielee?” The old
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>woman reached for the open window.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Here, sit away from that draft.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>With ancient instinct, she
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>wrapped her arms around the girl and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>drew her close, raising the window in
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the process. The girl continued to shiver,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>teeth making little bites against each
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>other. The woman smoothed the girl’s
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>hair and rubbed her neck, right down
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>near her back where it always hurt lately.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>She sat bolt upright.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>The forty feet around the curving
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>driveway in front of the buildings was
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>the hardest. While Harold stiffened and

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>let out an audible grunt when he saw the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sign, the old woman did and said noth

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>shivers, no pain.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Well, here we are,” Harold an
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>nounced, braking sharply and looking
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>hurt.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Thank you, Mr. Wannaker.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The two got out of the back and stood
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>bewildered in the wide driveway, as if for
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a second they floated on a thin strip of
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>land dividing two warring countries.

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>far from the nub.

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>When Harold hesitated a mo
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ment too long, the old woman was
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>forced to remind him that he had con
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tracted and been amply paid, in advance,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>for a round-trip ride. And they would be
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>waiting an hour from now for him at
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>this spot.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>As Harold drove slowly down the tree-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>lined street, the girl broke from the old
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>woman’s grip and ran after the dust-
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>spewing automobile. She only got as far
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>as the end of the driveway and stopped.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Above and around her, the skies were
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>moving like slow locomotives, and there
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>was nothing, no amount of running, that
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>would stop them. The girl straightened
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>her wrinkled jumper and walked de
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>murely back and took the old woman’s
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>hand. And hand in hand, they climbed
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the dozen steps to the Hicksville Re

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Loony bin, cracked, touched, bats.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Loose screw, loco, nut house. Crazy as a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>loon. Lightheaded. Mad. Everybody had
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>heard these words. Even then, I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>what they meant and, most often, who
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>they were describing. It didn’t mean
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>nothin to me. I could always look up at
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the dancing skies and make animals and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>pirates from the separated clouds. And
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>not listen to the words. Mine or anybody
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>else’s. Today was different. Today,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Grandma had brought me, and Mama
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>wanted to see me, and we had rented a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>real taxi-automobile and drove all the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>way to Hicksville in the pouring heat.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Grandma could hardly open the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>doors—they were so heavy—which I
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>thought was novel, since they had glass
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>in their centers. The front hallway was
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>empty except for some people in one of
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the waiting rooms off to the side. I
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>couldn’t think where everybody was,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>and maybe we were interrupting dinner

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>say she’s been on real good behavior
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>And she wants to see you, she really
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>does.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>May I help you?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>A cool, unaccented voice rose
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from the starched person walking
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>briskly down the long hallway to meet
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>us. She was younger than Mama and sad
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>looking, and I was wondering suddenly
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>if I would ever have a voice like she had
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>instead of the raspy, mumbling one
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>seemed to have been born with. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>looking us over as Grandma explained
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>why we were here: to see Mama, to check
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>on Edith, to, er, visit Mrs. Cabe in 413.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The doctor told me over the phone it
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was all right to bring the girl. She so
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>wants to see her.” Grandma was rum
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>maging in her purse for the letter. She
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>fairly forced the nurse to take it.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>“T’II be just a moment, Mrs... Becker.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The nurse conceded and motioned us
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to the vague area which included some

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and the refreshment area. She was al

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;Well, they don’t go out of their way to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>be friendly around here, do they?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Grandma observed. She was looking for
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a comfortable spot to park ourselves. I
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>got the feeling she anticipated a consid
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>erable wait. But it wasn’t more than three
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>minutes, I was timin on my birthday Ti

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>as she had gone. A crisp man who
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>shouted ’doctor’ all over him accompa

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>hind us started crying. Loud, ugly gasps
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>The doctor frowned, the nurse peeled
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>out of formation and went over to them
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>while the doctor smiled broadly at us.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Mrs. Becker, l’m Doctor Bailey. Good
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>to meet you.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>They shook hands. He belatedly took
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>mine in a mock grip.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>I came up to see my daughter and l

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Grandma tried not to sound pleading,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>but the doctor not talking made that
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>difficult.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>I know Edith, I know my daughter,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>would want to see her, especially since
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>we made this trip special and all. How is
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>she, doctor?
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>It was all a rush, and the doctor shook
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>his big head and took Grandma’s arm
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>and began to steer her away. I held tightly
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>onto her other arm. The bawling was still
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>goin’ on in the waiting room, making it
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>difficult to hear just what the doctor was
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>trying to tell Grandma. Besides which,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>he was prone to mumbling himself, but I
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>made out enough. “Erratic behavior,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>anti-social tendencies,” “potentially, er,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>physical reactions, and “pronounced
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>delusional patterns resulting from some
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>unknown trauma. In other words,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Mama wasn’t getting any better fast.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Grandma seemed not to take in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the words, but she caught the meaning
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>right enough.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>But doctor, the poor thing wants to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>see her own flesh and blood. She told
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>me so herself in that last letter.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Grandma made a last effort.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Tm sorry, Mrs. Becker, we just don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>feel it would be appropriate at this time.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Later, perhaps. After more extensive
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>therapy or... He trailed off, handing
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Grandma’s letter back to her. “But you,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Mrs. Becker, can visit with your daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>if you like. l’m afraid we’ll have to keep it
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>short, she shouldn’t be disturbed or
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>excited...
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>But l’ve brought fruit!” Grandma&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>voice broke. She fumbled in her purse,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>locating the bag of oranges and apples
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that the roadside seller woman had as
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sured us came from California direct.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The doctor, keeping his hand on Grand
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ma’s arm, called for the nurse.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Nurse! Nurse, take Mrs. Becker up to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Ward C, 413. Now, now, Mrs. Becker, go
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>with nurse and she’Il direct you and wait
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>for you and bring you back downstairs
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>when vou’re through.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Grandma, still trying not to cry
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>among strangers, began to follow the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>nurse, leaving me dragging along.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Grandma! Where....
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Oh, Annielee, honey, you go sit right
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>over there, next to the Pepsi machine.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Here’s a quarter.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>I don’t wanta a Pepsi, I wanta sec
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Mama.” There, I did it again, the words
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>just darting out of my mouth when
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>I thought I was only saying them in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>side me.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>“Course you do, but your Mama&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>feelin’ poorly today. And we have to do

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>The nurse smiled, obviously surprised
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>that Grandma had the feel of controlling
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>a potential situation so well. They walked
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>down the hall and up the stairs at
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the end.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>I don’t know to this day what pos-

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>near the door. I just found myself pop
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>ping the quarter in the machine, getting

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>uid pour into the cup, and then the ice,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and then the water. From somewhere
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>upstairs a long, loud yell rang out and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>then what sounded like something soft
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>making contact with something hard. I
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>took one sip of the Pepsi. Sharp, metallic
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>taste, too cold, too immovable. In one

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>noticed. Only I watched the sugary water

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>How do you live with graying hairs?
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Avery educated woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>You go to interviews.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>They look at you.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I have only three or four at once,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>But Ihave seen them,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The women working for so much less,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>getting rejected in new places.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Uh, dear,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Yes, they might even say that to you,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Oh, dear,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Well,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Eight dollars an hour,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>And IknewI was getting twice as much,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Or more,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>And I would mention it,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>And they would get upset.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>What is the future there?
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N019'/>ii
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N020'/>There is still the other side,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N021'/>The one of endless birthdays.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N022'/>It&apos;s Utopia; the best occurs,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N023'/>And there we always know
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N024'/>Exactly what to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N025'/>When I&apos;m sleepless,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N026'/>It fades to black,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N027'/>But other times,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N028'/>Ia dd some details.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Now this is only one woman speaking;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it could be different for you. No doubt
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>you are some other age and in a different
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>circumstance; but listen to me for I am
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>one of you, and I shall tell you stories.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>When I was nine I loved my life. I
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was safe, and yes, this is looking back and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>seeing it now, but I was safe. There was
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>food, a clean bed, and I could play.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>knew Grandma was ill, but could she
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>die? Not in my cosmogony. Then she
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>died and I got older.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Then one by one the others died as I
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>grew taller in my prom gowns, secretly
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>reading, arguing, hiding in museums
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and at concerts in parks. At sixteen I had
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>no parents, but many friends, a little sis
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ter, and a mean old guardian uncle. I
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>knew no women who showed me any of
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>what I might want to do, and I never
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>thought then I could do it alone, so I
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>married a man. He wasn’t Uncle, and, at
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>first, he liked the same things I did and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>we could talk, but we knew nothing of
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>each other, and that got worse as we
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lived longer in the same places. But lis
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ten, I have promised you stories.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Here is the story of Gerlinda, yes,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>her name was Gerlinda, or maybe she
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was Emma. We went to grammar school
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>together. She quickly learned English
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>enough to almost win from me the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>eighth-grade prizes. And then, when I
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>saw her last, she worked in a tiny travel
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>agency, where once the old ice-cream
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>parlor had been in that old, old place, in
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the old neighborhood of our eighth
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>grade, and then we were thirty-four.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>There is also Claudia, from a different
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>time of mine and other circumstances.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and wealthy, yes, born wealthy. And she
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>threw herself away, for nearly twenty
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>years, on a self-important man who, yes,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>he did, he beat her. So I and friends, we
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>talked to her and finally she left, and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>soon enough, she could support herself
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and life and child and sneeze fully on
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>that now inconsequential male.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>This is not to say that it isn&apos;t possible to
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>conjugate, as a girl with boys, or as a
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>woman with men; but I think it’s hard
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and can lead to much confusion, which is
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>not to say it can’t be done. Nor do I mean
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to say that Emma Gerlinda might not
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>have had, secretly, later, or in another
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>place, an entire other life, perhaps in her
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>room at night. And I might have been
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Gerlinda, or you, Emma. Instead, I had
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>already flown, on a sixties youthfare
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ticket, to get divorced in Mexico, come
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>home delirious, to be alone, and then
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>done what I could of things I wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>But I need more stories, so here is
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the story of Mara. Mara lived with her
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>mother and father and a younger sister.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Then Mara met Bill. In the oldest-fash
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ioned sense, it was love at first sight.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>They soon produced another Mara, and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Bill gave up all his old lovers, boy and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>girl, and man, and woman. Mara went
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>back to school. And the new Mara, well,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>you should see her. But I should add that
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the sister of the elder Mara killed herself.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>She jumped out a window alone and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>high on drugs.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>There is also Sara. I did love Sara&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>mother. We went through schools and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>lovers together. And then she married,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>and Sara, well, there is a bell that could
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ring in tomorrow.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Now these have been mostly easy
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>tales. We forget, I do, maybe on purpose,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the women who died of cancer in the fif-
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>ties, feeling only their family’s resent
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>ment. How could you do this to us? You
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>are so ugly now. And then there was no
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>help. There were sisters and daughters
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>who dealt with this mostly in silence, or
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>among those too young to be telling any-
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>thing to. We forget too the women who
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_11_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>stare from windows. We forget purdah,
			</p>
			<pb n='61'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and many no longer young or sane or
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>talking.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and there was Mara’s sister. Rose
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>went out some, from twenty to twenty-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>three, but thought to herself and said to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>us that she was dumb and ugly. We who
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>knew her saw she wasn’t, and with Mara
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and others, well, we tried to tell her, but
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>it didn’t take. Then she met a boy, yes, he
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>was still a boy, silly on drugs, and he gave
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>them to her, and we would see her inco
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>herent at dinner, unable to eat, and we’d
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>still try just to talk to her. Her parents
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>were worse. They yelled and threatened.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>But she did try to stop, and then she did
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and then her boyfriend disappeared, and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>then, mostly, she stayed in her room at
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>home till one day when, somehow,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>when she was out, she got more drugs,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and that night, really it was almost morn
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing, everyone else was sleeping, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>climbed out onto the balcony, then she
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>climbed over it, and then she fell.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I remember, too, a novelist, chubby
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and nervous. She drank a lot, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>wrote well. Then she went to London
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and bought a house. Once we ate an ele
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>gant lunch she’d made there, under her
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>skylights, and we talked about writing
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and clothes, mortgages and loneliness. A
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>few months later she was dead, in her
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>late thirties, of sleeping pills and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>alcohol.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>So there should have been more
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>dinners and lunches, more letters or
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>phone calls or more of almost anything
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>from all of us. We could have brought the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>birthday cakes and danced in a circle, lis
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tened and sang. But I have promised you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stories. What age would you like to hear
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>about? Emma Gerlinda was thirty-four
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and Claudia’s almost fifty. Mara is now
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>thirty-seven, and the new Mara and Sara
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>aren’t ten. Mara’s sister was twenty-four,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and the novelist, thirty-eight. At forty
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>four I remember nine because l’m tired
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and I want to rest. l’ve been thinking how
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I have been dancing a long time. At
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>twelve I was learning the steps, and at
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>seventeen the pattern is often inflexible.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>But slowly, if you can, you crumble the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>rules, and you dance more and more in a
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>way that you choose. Now and then you
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>question your steps. Maybe you change
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>them or even decide to give up dancing,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>but then you get dull and thick and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>bored and come out again with a better
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pair of shoes. So my stories might tell
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>you how you cannot, a woman, be Rip
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Van Winkle.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Or maybe you can. Or maybe the com-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>parison doesn’t quite hold in this story of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Josephine. Yes, that really could be her
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>name, it can be, you know, a name. Jo-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sephine married young and quickly had
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>three boys. Her husband, well, she left
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>him when she had three babies, one and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>three and five, and she was twenty-four.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>She went to work as a secretary typing
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>for money for food and rent and babysit-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ters. The boys grew and so did she. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>she married a teacher and they all went
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>West and lived and grew up further.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Then the boys were gone to college. Jo-
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sie left her second husband, and where
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was she then, she thought, with no
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>money and no place to go? She worked
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>at dull, dull jobs, and then she found a

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>place of her own. With no help, she
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>moved what she had on a dolly she
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>pulled through the streets. Then she
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>found more little jobs. Once, then, I met
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>her at one of her jobs, and she had no
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>money at all. I had brought a tuna sand
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>wich, iced tea, and we shared it. She
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>wouldn’t take any money ThenJosie met
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Roy All went well. Josie made sculptures.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Roy did too. They bought some land in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the country. They lived in tents while Jo-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sie designed a house and then they built
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>it. They are busy there with sculptures
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and guests, flowers and ponds and frogs,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and even birds and stars. Josie worries
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>about her independence, or depen
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>dence. The last word depends on how
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>you see the story.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Now I do have other stories, so I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>hope you will listen more, but first con
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sider that last story, the one about Josie.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>It’s a help to me, because I come of age as
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>I tell you stories. The gray hairs, mine,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the three or four at once, like the inter-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>views, they get longer. In other places
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and other times, that metallic glint, that
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>changing of colors, it would have been
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>respected. In old China, when a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>had passed the years of so-called fruitful
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sex, she became, to those younger in her
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>family, and to others, one of power and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>wisdom. The older women of the Iro-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>quois sat in council, made laws.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Now for sure it isn’t any fun to need
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>strong glasses. It’s also a bore to have
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>your feet or back or hands or knees hurt
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>all day or be stiff at sunrise, but here and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>now, for some at sixty-eight or more,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>alone or even with company, or even
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>very much less in years, it’s hard to have
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>just the cash for food or rent unless
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>you’ve been extraordinary. All would
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>give presents to children, or to their
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>grandchildren, if they have them. Sc
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>many do what they have to. I know about
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>have to; that’s how I met Catherine. She is
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>fifty-two. She knows how to write very
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>well for textbooks—reading, grammar,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>spelling, she can do them well, and then
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>what, or why? To get the money But have
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>you looked at a textbook lately? Pick one
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>up—grades preprimer to twelve. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>what she does, and this is the future, and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>she does it for very little money Last time
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>I talked to her she had a cold. She had it
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>because she’d turned down the heat in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>her house. No, there isn’t always enough
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>for heat at eight dollars an hour, and yes,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>to some extent, she is part of the sys
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>tem, and readily hired, at eight dollars
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>an hour.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>There is also Madelaine, or she is a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>different Catherine. Now she is seventy-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>six. Once they were nine, the brothers
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and sisters, and as often happened in that
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>time, the father, a bricklayer, died before
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>fifty. The mother relied on the sisters and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>brothers and children. At twelve
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Catherine was working in a local gar
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ment factory. Nothing happened, just
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>work and Christmases, more New Years
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and returning Easter Sundays. She still
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>says she was never pretty like her sisters.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In fact, she has cut off the parts of old
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>photographs where she stood. At twenty-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>nine she married the owner of one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>factories in which she sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>worked. He was educated. She was not.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>He spoke of music and the ballet while
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>she ironed his shirts. He went to the op
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>era. She stayed home. They had a son.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>When her husband died, Catherine was
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>fifty-four. She still wears black, and her
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>son seldom visits. She lives on pensions,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>food stamps, occasional phone calls, and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>what’s on television.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Unlike Claudia, Clarissa was not born
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>wealthy, in fact, she doesn’t know exactly
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>where she was born. She was adopted
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>early into a farm family in the American
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Midwest. As she grew, she got bored, so
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>she went away to study art. She was good
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>at it. Then she lived the scrabbly life of a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>young woman artist alone in a big city.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Then she decided. She didn’t want the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>life she had and nothing more. She
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>found a delightful man and she married
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>him. Then she decided again. She
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>wanted a better job. She got it and her
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>work continues.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>There is also Brenda. She lived ten
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>years with a man who didn’t want chil-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>dren, but she did. She wrote poems, and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>then she left him. She married another
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>poet, a man who wanted children. They
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>had three, and they wrote more poems,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>but between them it didn’t work. So she
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>left again and now she has the children
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and friends and poems and eager stu
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>dents in writing classes.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Betty was different. She loved Claire.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Betty wrote novels and Claire loved
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>math. For a long time, Betty’s novels
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>didn’t do so well, but Claire learned
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>more and more about computers. Now
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>they live in an old, old house that Betty
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>bought with some money from the nov
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>els. When I visit them, I get their rocking
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>chair, and we tell stories.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Annie’s also quite a tale, but it would
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>be too long to tell about all her sculp
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>tures, or they could be paintings, about
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>her lovers and family, her many one-time
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>jobs, and how she got to where, now, she
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>can do mostly what she wants.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>But if I had the time, the story would
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>go something like this: Annie made
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>sculptures or maybe she made paintings.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Then she found a man. She made more
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sculptures but he didn’t like them, or
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>they were paintings. Her friends did, and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>so did &quot;they” who gave her money in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>grants, and she figured out how to sell
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her work. But he was impossible. There
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>were more sculptures, or they could be
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>paintings. Friends applauded and he
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>scowled. He got lost.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>So now l’ve told more stories. But I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and my friends are a privileged bunch.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>We are white, educated, we look fine,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and we are a small, small part of all the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women, so our comings of age, though
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>important, speak and tell of only really a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>little edge of all the women. We owe a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>lot, and we need to understand, if we
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>can, the worst.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>So can I write for you, a story of really
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the worst, of desperation? Yes, indeed,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sometimes I have no money, but usuallyl
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>can get it, and I live in a place with run
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ning water, heat, and I have not only a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>possible bank account, but also years of
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>good enough schools and books, and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>jobs and pleasures. People will hire me.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>They even like what I do. So I sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>have money to spend even on cats I keep
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>for my pleasure, and sometimes time
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>enough, but I want more, to play at doing
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>what I like and asking questions. Though
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I sometimes wish I were nine again and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>could play forever, then again I would
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>soon become ten and thirty and fifty and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>seventy-three. I also know few women in
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>all the last several centuries have done so
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>well as I and some friends of mine. So
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>can I tell you stories of the very hardest
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>lives and should I What good would it
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>do if I could? Would we then go out and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>feed the hungry, give them warmth and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>dignity?
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Here’s a try. There is a woman with
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>only one leg who sits on a corner near
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>where I live. She is black but scarred
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>light and pink on her face and arms. Dif-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ferent people bring her food, give her
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>money and help her home to the shabby
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>hotel in which she lives. What does she
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>think as she lies in bed? No, I cannot tell
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>her story.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>So here is how I see it now, because I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>heard it from my niece. She is eleven and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>she said:
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>When you are old enough you
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>know what to do, and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>you can do it without asking any
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>body. You fix up
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>the world. Like that old lady. She
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>likes the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>cookies, and we talk. She tells me
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>stories.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>When you are old I will take care
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>ofyou.

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>It wasn’t a bad job, now that I look

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to tell me.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>It occurs to me now that what seemed

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and they have a lot of Jews there. She
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>even married one of them so I guess my

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>but I forget which ones were born

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>All that talk of cities and places
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was like magic elixir to me. Ever since I

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in Cannes. When I first met Ray he was in

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and local color. Then when we got mar

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>stopped telling stories—putting all that
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>behind him, and I stopped getting one
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>word out of him about going to sea.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Listening to Ina, I felt all those old
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>yearnings come back in a rush. l’m now

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>idea began. We had settled into her

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of Meals on Wheels. Ina was just about to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>get around to telling me how she wound

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>when I was suddenly struck with a

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>didn’t stay married long enough to that
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Jewish guy to find out.” Then I started
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>once again to go out.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Tell me,” she said as if her questions
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>could hold me there, “what is this Swap
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Meet?
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Well, I did wind up staying way over
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>time to tell her. I couldn’t blame her for

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>wanting to know about things going on
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>outside her little trailer. Although she
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>has a ramp leading up to the door, built
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>by her son-in-law so they can get the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>wheelchair up and down, she almost
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>never goes out. Oh, a couple of times a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>month a special van comes to take her to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the Seniors Arts and Crafts Center. But
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>l’m about the only person she was seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>outside of her daughter Elena, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Spanish woman from Meals on
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Wheels—but she doesn’t talk much. SoI
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>found myself going on maybe a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>longer than I should have explaining the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Swap Meet. But all I said about the Swap
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Meet was that it’s the same thing people
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tell me they call a flea market back East.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>On weekends people who have stuff to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sell rent a space on what’s a big black
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>topped lot left from when some develop-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ers thought they’d build a shopping mall
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>there before the Air Force moved out of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>town and all their jobs and personnel
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with it. Some realty people got the idea
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to use the place as a Swap Meet. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>part of it—the part where I mostly go—is
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>booths where people bring their
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>crafts—just stuff they made at home, ma
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>cramé, hooked rugs, jewelry made out of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>shells or rocks they picked up at the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>beach. Mostly, however, there are
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>marked-off stalls where people got a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>good deal on a gross of luggage, say, or
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sweaters, jackets, men’s suits, belts, any
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>kind of thing and they sit there all day on
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>camp chairs hoping somebody will buy.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Then some sell fruits and vegetables, but
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>that&apos;s almost all Mexicans and Arabs, and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>you have to watch for prices and thumbs
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>on the scale. Most of the people are
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>pretty nice and offer you coffee if you’re
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>there selling with them, and the fog
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>starts coming in thick. Iusually get a stall
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>end of November through Christmas for
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>selling my granny dolls. My granny
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>dolls—by that time I had given Ina one-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>are simple to make—I spent fifteen years
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>in Frisco as a sewing machine operator
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>so they’re pretty easy on my machine at
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>home. I take a granny face with a wig-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>you can buy those wholesale at a notions
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>supply house and attach it to a base then
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>sew up a hat and this big full-length skirt.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>I put pockets in the skirt to hold napkins
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>or dried flowers for a centerpiece on
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>your table, sort of to get a conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>going. Made 5257.50 sheer profit on
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>them last year and that, of course, was
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>weekends only.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Well, that was all Ina had to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>hear. &quot;Marta, it&apos;s just like a bazaar, isn’t it?
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>I mean like the ones they had in the small
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>towns in Egypt and then, I remember, we
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>used to go in the Arab sectors of Israel.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>“I never thought of it that way,” I said.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Just a regular California Swap Meet like
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>they have all over the state. I don’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>what they call them in other places.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;And you sell things there. And the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>people come to buy... with my crochet
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>...Can you take me there?” Well, I had to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tell her I couldn’t, what with Social Secu
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rity rules. But she begged and wheedlec
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the hell out of me. Finally, after a week
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>when it’d been raining hard out of sea
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>son and she’d been entirely shut in with
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>no one but her daughter to come by
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and hers only a perfunctory visit—anc
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Ina didn’t even get out to Senior Arts and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Crafts, and had to ask me to pick up some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>yarn for her crocheting, I began to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>give in.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The thing you have to understand
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>about Ina and her crocheting is that she&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>getting close on to being blind. She usu
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ally recognizes me whenever I come.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The smaller details she sees dim. But at
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Senior Arts and Crafts they managed to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>teach her how to crochet—she’d never
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>done it before. But they only gave her
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>one pattern. Typical. She does over and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>over again these sort of top hats that fit
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>over a roll of toilet paper so you can keep
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>a spare roll hidden on the counter if you
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>have one in your bathroom or on top of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the tank and it’Il look decorative instead
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of just a roll of toilet paper sitting there
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>staring at you—Johnny-toppers the SAC
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>calls them. Now, of course, with her bad
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>eyesight Ina has to crochet them in large
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stitches so, even though the point is to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>hide it, the toilet paper shows through.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>You never want to tell Ina about that,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>though, because that was just about the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>only creative thing she could do.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>But she wanted so bad to go to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the Swap Meet and I wasn’t thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about why or why not. She wanted to see
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>about selling her crochetwork, she said,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and I said that was pretty impractical but
			</p>
			<pb n='67'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I did not want to let on to her in any way
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>that I did not think her Johnny-toppers
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>would go. “Why do you want to sell stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>at the Swap Meet?” I asked her. “It’s a full
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>day sitting there dealing with people and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>not much of a payoff. You’re not used to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that kind of hard work—Miss Jewish
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>American Princess.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>That’s it, said Ina, and there was a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>teasing glint to her smile. &quot;It must be be
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cause l’m Jewish. You never heard of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that? Jewish people like to sell things.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>That’s how we survive. For years it was
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>diamonds across the exchange. Now
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>yarn made into hats for the toilet paper.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>You got to keep at it. Keep going. Stay
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>alive.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>To stay alive and keep at it—I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>exactly what she meant. Then with those
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>words and the look on her face, I finally
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>gave in. &quot;But we’Il go the first time just to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>explore—check it out, as my grandson
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>would say And l’ve got to see if theyre

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>going to have my space back for my

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>We could sell together. l’Il pay half
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the rent, said Ina, and her face was all
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>elated and cheery with smiles. “That way
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>you could still take care of me and every-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>thing would be kosher with the SS.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Well, Ina and I started out swell
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>at the Swap Meet, at least to begin with
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Some Mexican fellows helped her out of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my car with the wheelchair and we set
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>out together, me pushing, exploring the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stalls, with her speaking all her lan
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>guages that fit. All the time sitting up re
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>gal like some queen of the Gypsies. First,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>to sort of get a feel of the place, we went
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>up and down the squares of tomatoes,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cutlery, tools, galoshes, old and new
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>clothes, books, books, books—mostly
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Reader’s Digest Condensed. Everywhere
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>we went I had friends from the last cou-

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>time exchanging weather reports, health
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>news, and estimates of this season&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>crowd. I showed Ina off to everyone, in-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>troducing her as a prospective seller, and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>everywhere the folks all were nice to her
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and she was full of smiles for whatever or
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>whoever she saw or could dimly make
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>out. Finally, after she’d found some Arabs
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>who’d migrated up from LA. she could
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>talk to, she began to look a bit peaked.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>It&apos;s not quite like an Egyptian bazaar,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Marta, she whispered, &quot;but, even so, it
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>brings back my youth. And the moun

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>grass mountains take me right back to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Israel.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>We had stopped by then, found some
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>sodas, and I sat on a camp stool beside
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>her, both of us in a mood together we
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>had not been before. “I wouldn’t want to

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>That is, if somebody’s good enough
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to wheel you out to see them, Ina said.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>And she took my hand in hers—and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>she d never done that to me before.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>&quot;Come on,&quot; I said before I
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>teared up, “let me find out about my sell-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ing space for the napkin dolls up in the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>crafts shed before it gets booked.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>And the Johnny-toppers, Ina said
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>stiffening up for the resumed ride.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>&quot;Don’t forget that. You and me selling
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>here together. We’d have a hell of a time.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>l’m good at selling
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>I know, I know, I said, patting her
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>hand, “you re Jewish. You know how
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to sell.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>She didn’t answer, just smiled.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Well, I guess the trip to the Crafts Shed
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>was the beginning of our undoing. I had
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>forgotten that the woman who rents the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>space there on weekends is also a some-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>thing or other for Social Security Iwasn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>even thinking of that by that time. And
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>she didn’t say word one to me about it ei-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ther. Only too glad to get my check for
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the space. Once I was finished, Ina was
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>just getting herself drawn together to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>speak up for her share. Then the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>woman—Stella Marks—looks down by
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>the wheelchair where we had it parked
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>with the brake on smack dab in her As
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>troturf. And hers was one of the few stalls
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>had more on the floor of it than blacktop,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_5_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>gravel, or plywood. Then I looked down,
			</p>
			<pb n='68'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>too. There was a big puddle streaming
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>off under the wheelchair in that yellowy
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>color all of us know. And I had double
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>diapered her too, both layers lined in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>surgical plastic.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;You can&apos;t bring this lady in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>here, Martha.” Stella started to reach for
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the wheelchair herself. I pushed her
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>away. “She belongs at home. You can’t
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>bring her out here at her age.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>She doesn’t mean anything by it,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>said. But I felt guilty the way you do when
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>you take a new baby out for a visit to in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>laws and right away it pees in their lap
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Her nerves in that part of her body are
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>all gone from her stroke, I explained.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>She doesn’t even feel it when it comes
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>“Take her home, Martha,” Stella said
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;I guess I can hose it down later. Hope
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>none of my customers see.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>It must have been Stella Marks who re

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>worked there, so maybe it could have
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>been anybody—who knows, even Ina s
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>daughter Elena—upset that I had worn
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Ina out. Ina was pretty beat down by the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>time I got her back home.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The people at Social Security did al
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>low me one last visit, though, to make the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>rounds of all my shut-ins, say good-bye
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and tell them they’d be getting some
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>body new. Ina was the last on my list.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I could tell she knew what I came for.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Her eyes were just a bit teary—not much.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>She handed me a Johnny-topper. “I want
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>you to remember me, she said.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Talready have ten at home,&quot; I told her.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>&quot;You’ll definitely be hard to forget.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>“Take this one, she insisted, anc
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>thrust one into my hand. It was sort of a
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>rose color and she’d even managed, in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>spite of bad eyes, to sew on a few beads.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>&quot;Okay,” I said. &quot;All right. At least it
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>matches my paint.” I stuffed the rose-col
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ored Johnny-topper into my bag. &quot;Hey,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>said after a bit, my grandson sent me a
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>newJAP joke. This one’s fresh from New
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>York.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>How’s that?” she asked. Maybe it was
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>late. She didn’t seem to have her usual
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>spunk.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>&quot;Jewish-American Princess. I
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>told you—they’re calling them JAPS.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>More of your anti-semitism?” she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>said. A spark of the old tease came back
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>to her eyes. I told her the joke—the one
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>about how do you know when a Jewish
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>American Princess has an orgasm. And
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>the punchline is that she drops her em
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>ery board
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Oh, Ina said, when I finally ex
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>plained it to her the third time through.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Just flat like that. “Oh, I get it. Anti-semitic
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>but funny. I guess I can laugh at orgasms,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>too.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Then we both laughed together.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;Don’t get me started, I said while we
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>were wiping our eyes. “Don’t make me
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>laugh. Ever since my bladder infection
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>every time I laugh or I cry, I leak.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>“That’s how it starts, said Ina. “You
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>better watch out. Pretty soon it will be
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>me diapering you.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>“That&apos;s only fair,’ I said. &quot;T’II be sure to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>call you, so I don’t get just any old dope
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Social Security sends out.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>For a while neither one of us spoke.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>“Will you be able to get another job,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Marta?” Ina suddenly asked
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I thought for a minute about how to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>answer. I knew what the situation was
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>but I wasn’t sure how much I wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>worry Ina with that.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>“They had somebody younger an
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>swered the ads, I said. &quot;“Right after they
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>told me I didn’t have enough experience
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>for this kind of work
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>&quot;Forty years raising two fami
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>lies isn’t the right kind of experience?
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Ina asked.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;Well, what do I know—go fight City
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Hall. Anyway, l’ve got a good man prom
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ised to support me. So as long as he lives
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and is able to work I guess l’Il be okay.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>“The next twenty-five years without
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>working?” The fading sun streaked Ina s
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>hair silver while she talked. “If I hac
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the money that’s slipped through my
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>hands l’d hire you to work for me
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>permanently.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>&quot;If I had that kind of money myself, l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>quit your old job and take off for the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>countries where you’ve already been.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>She smiled, creasing the folds of her
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>flesh. There was a long pause when she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>did nothing more than just squeeze my
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>hand. &quot;You d&apos;better go, she said finally.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>&quot;Go on. Scoot. I know good-byes in eight
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>languages. You would be here all night.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Even so, I urged her to let me change
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>her and wash her down clean for the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>night one last time, and do her up ready
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>for bed. We squeezed hands again at the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>end. That was all.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Out in the evening, driving away from
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the trailer court, I watched the sun set on
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the Pacific over the dunes, making sort of
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>sparkly little doodads on the surface of
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>the water like tiny red fish scales shiver-
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>ing in the night sky. To either side I
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>could just make out the parched yellow
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>hills with the shrub oak still dusty and
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>dry before the real rains started in. I did
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>not want to go home right away. I drove
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>up the coast a ways to Morro bay just in
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>time to watch the fishing fleet come in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>around the reef. I always thought this
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>stretch of coast looked like pictures of It
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>aly I used to pore over with grand plans
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>when I first married Ray.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>parked the car near the shell shop
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and walked down to the pier to watch the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>young boys leaning over their rods and
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the old men lowering crab traps baited
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>with fish heads and guts. Some tourists
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>were snapping pictures of the boats, the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>boys, and the crab men. One turned her
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>camera on me as I leaned in loose swea
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ter and slacks over a rail. Local color
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>were we? I was probably going to wind
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>up in somebody’s slide show, which I
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>supposed was the only way l’d get to be
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>immortalized. I badly needed a drink. I
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>walked down to a little out of the way bar
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>off the pier where a lot of the fishermen
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>came. Some were Portuguese and spoke
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>almost no English. One of the men, fish
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>scales gleaming off the backs of his
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hands, went to the juke box and put on
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>some kind of Iberian beat. I downed a
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>straight shot of Dewers all in one take.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>This was, I decided, as much as I was ever
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>going to see of how the rest of the world
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>lives. Ray probably wasn’t home yet or I
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>would have called him to join me. I
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>thought of what it must have been like
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>for Ina living in faraway countries to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>come here. If I had had another chance

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>osity, asperity and honesty were teamed
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with a gentle heart, a touch of sentimen
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tality, and an acute sense of life’s small
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>daily pleasures. As growing children in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Paraguay, my siblings and I knew Gran
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>only from our mother’s picture albums
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and from the loving, awkwardly written
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>letters she sent. Her simple gifts to us
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>seemed exotic: store-bought clothes,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>rose-printed birthday cards, real English
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>shoes, flower-seeds, tea, biscuits and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>chocolate—and best of all, books! Over
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the years she sent me on my birthdays
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the entire Flower Fairy series. In return I
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sent her books I wrote and illustrated,

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>come stay with her. I received her
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>guarded answer after many weeks: yes, I
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>could visit a short time, but I could not
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>live with her. Only much later did I fully
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>appreciate the jolt my sudden request
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>must have caused her. After almost thirty
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>years of living alone, having seen neither
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her daughter nor her grandchildren, the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>prospect of my visit must have caused
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>her a terrible mixture of joy and pain.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Separation was easier to bear when
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>clean and complete. Later she told me
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>about the anger and old bitterness that
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>first welled up in her when she got my
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>letter, then said, &quot;But how could I say no

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I left NYC in a February snow storm,-
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>on my own for the first time. I was only
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>one or two years older than my mother
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>had been when she left home. The plane
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>came in over England, moist and mild in
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>light rain, the fields green and brown, ev
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ery inch of it a cultivated garden. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>10 p.m. by the time I hired a taxi for the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>final leg of the journey; looking out
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>through its windows, I was struck by how
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>crooked and dingy all the houses looked
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in the wet lamp light.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I was emotionally dazed, just as she
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>must have been when I first saw her at
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the door with two kind friends who had
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>agreed to stand vigil with her. The first
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>terribly awkward moments were
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>smothered by her practicality, as she
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>bossily insisted on paying the cab driver,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>lecturing me all the while about tipping
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and extravagance, etc. Meanwhile, we
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>stole looks at each other, shyly and hun
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>grily, not daring yet to express our con
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>fused emotions openly. She looked
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>much like her pictures, except that those
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>had never conveyed her height, her sur
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>prising vigor, her angular boniness, and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the mischievous twinkle in her eye. For
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>her part, she kept exclaiming over me:
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>how like our Ede” Iwas, yet how unlike,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>how pretty, how thin, how American my
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>accent, what a lovely coat, what lovely
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>luggage, etc. We were inside and alone
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>by now, and fussed ’round each other,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>half-heartedly eating some stale biscuits
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>and cheese and drinking burned cocoa.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Finally, we gave up, exhausted by unex
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>pressed emotion and anticipation. “Time
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>for your bed,” Gran said, and led me up
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>stairs to what had been my mother’s bed-
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>room, though years of boarders had
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>used it since.

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Ehe small downstairs parlor had
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>been warm and close, but the two upper
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>bedrooms and small bathroom were
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>damp and icy Gran helped me undress
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>as though I was a child, fingering each
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>garment curiously and folding it neatly
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>upon a chair. She marveled that I insisted
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>on brushing my teeth and long 1960’s
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>hair, then tucked me into bed and kissed
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>me good-night, &quot;God-bless.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>For a long time I couldn’t sleep. The
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>bed had an ancient lumpy mattress and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was decidedly damp, and the threadbare
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>flannel sheets had been washed and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>darned hundreds of times. I lay there
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>freezing and thought about Gran. What
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>kept her going all these years? How had
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>she found the strength to live in this
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cheerless, lonely little house so long?
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Was she so poor that she couldn’t afford
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>new sheets, a proper heating system,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>good blankets? Later I was to learn that
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>thrift was so deeply ingrained in Gran
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>that she practiced it unconsciously, often
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>denying herself things she could easily
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>have afforded. After Gran’s death from
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>hypothermia, my mother found the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>warm nightgowns, thick blankets and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>new towels she had sent Gran over the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>years, carefully stored away in drawers,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>never used.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I was awakened by Gran pulling the
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>curtains back vigorously on a damp, grey
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>day. “Time to get up, now, love. l’ve done
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>me marketing and there’s a nice egg for
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>your breakfast.” It was 8:30. I said that 1
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>had to have a bath first, and she handed
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>me a threadbare towel with the admon-
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ishment not to use more than a few
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>inches of water because “Tve got me
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>washing to do today.” Baths presented a
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>problem throughout my stay, and I had
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to compromise by washing my long hair
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>in the sink. She herself washed standing
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>up at the sink, and took a bath in five
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>inches of tepid water every Saturday.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>While I ate the boiled egg, tea, cold
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>toast and marmalade, Gran slurped at a
			</p>
			<pb n='74'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>cup of tea and talked away about the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>neighbors, wet weather, the minister’s
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>illness, politics and the latest football
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>scores. Although she had only an ele
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>mentary school education, Gran had an
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>intelligent, alert mind, read the paper,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>listened to the radio, and was pre
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>pared to discuss current affairs very
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>knowledgeably.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Breakfast over, she announced that it
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>was time to do the washing. She had set
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the clothes to soak the night before and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>now took out her “dolly” tub and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>wooden washboard. Each garment was
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>vigorously scrubbed on the washboard,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>after which the whites were put in her
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>boiler and the darks rinsed, put through
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a hand mangle and hung in the grey driz-

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>derette in town. She did the tasks of her
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>household in the exact way she had done
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>them for almost fifty years, heedless of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the many labor-saving machines which
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>had been invented during that time.

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as we worked about the house and took a
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>walk in the rain around the rural lanes.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Gran was as shabby as a gypsy in her old
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tweed skirt, felt hat, mackintosh and rub
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ber boots. She pointed her nose into the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>cold drizzle, sniffed the earth-fresh air
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sharply and led me along at an incredi
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ble pace. We walked arm in arm at her
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>insistence, though she was always a pace
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ahead of me, and as we went she recited
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the history of each street, lane, tree, and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>field, describing how it had looked when
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>my mother had walked with her there. A
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>few times, I think she forgot who I was,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and thought she walked again with her
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>daughter at her side. We laughed a great
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>deal together—she had a wicked sense
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>of humor which spared no one. When
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>she saw a team practicing rugby in a wet
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>field, she leaned over the gate and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>started shouting to the men about their

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>lousy scores at last Saturday’s match, and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>as we watched them, she saucily
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mimicked a sports announcer, sending
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>me into fits of laughter.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The next day I had a chance to see how
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>neatly organized and purposeful Gran’s
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>daily life was. We rose at 6:30 and went
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>downstairs, where Gran kneeled at the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>fireplace to scrape out the ashes and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>heap fresh pieces of coke on the still
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>glowing coals. The fireplace heated the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>bathwater. Then breakfast—usually just
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>toast and tea and marmalade—and after
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>wards, the daily marketing round, for
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>which we walked to the bus stop and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>rode into Widnes. There we shopped at
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the covered market, picking a lettuce

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>her “family,” for whose children she had
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>cared and who had adopted her as their
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>grandmother. We were served a huge,

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and throughout the meal, I was told story
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>after story about all the things Gran had
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>done for them. It was obvious that Gran
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>was an adored and precious member of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>this family, and it made me feel im
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>mensely relieved and grateful. My own
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>family had not abandoned Gran out of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>malice or neglect, but had been forced to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>leave her because of ethical and reli

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>wonderful human versatility Gran had
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>simply made herself another family,

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>which was, in many ways, much more
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>akin to her beliefs and way of life than
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her biological family.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>After a week together, I announced
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that I was now ready to go to Oxford to

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for a while if I liked—making the su-

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>smiled through tears, thanked her and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>said that I would certainly consider it,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>should I not be able to make my way in
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Oxford.

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and drizzly. I saw the tears in her eyes as
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>she kissed me quickly, and I whispered,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>T’II come back at Easter to see you,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Gran.” I kept my promise.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>My father called me on March 17, to

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>suffering from hypothermia—the loss of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>body heat. Clinging fiercely to her inde-

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>she had left each of us $100, a sum it was
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>difficult for me to spend when I thought
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of how much comfort it could have
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>bought her. But it was her way.

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>On the third meeting, we talked above the sound of speeding
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>cars in the hills of yore. Now Hiam showed me photographs.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>They were the ones she took of her sisters’ Arabic weddings. “I,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>myself, will never marry, and I questioned why, holding her
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>hand until she could answer.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>My sisters had to remove their pubic hair on their wedding
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>day to appear more virginal to the groom. My own mother had to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>make the concoction, sticky as molasses. It hurt so. She saw me
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cringe, another woman. At that moment, the last thing she cared
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>about was that I was Jewish. &quot;You know, footbinding and cli
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>torectomies were also executed by mothers who do not realized
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>they do the work of the patriarchy,” I said. Just like here, she
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>nodded. And we knew our common ground was feminism.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>And so it came to pass that two by two, one Arabic and one
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Jewish woman did struggle to pull out stones from the dry crust
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of the Earth at Vadi Salib in July of 1981. They did pull until their
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>hands became moist from the Earth beneath the crust.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>These stones were here before the Jew, before the Arab,
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Hiam noted.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Then their hands would meet as they tied the corners of the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cloth together in double knots. And when they lifted the sac to
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>bring it to the center of the archway, the stones did make a sound
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>from within, clanging. A ten-year-old Jewish daughter and a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>twelve-year-old Arab daughter giggled at the solemnity of their
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>mothers. “Do one yourselves!” Neely suggested to her daughter.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>And so it came to pass that the daughters of Sarah and the daugh-
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ters of Hagar followed their mothers and their little brothers
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>joined them gleefully, handing them the stones. At the end of the
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Gathering, the deserted village had two sacs of stones in every
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>archway.
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>&quot;Let us leave these sacs for the police to find,” Chedva sug-
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>gested. “They will think these are bombs, and when they pull
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>apart the knots and look inside, they will discover women’s

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N035'/>For a second, I thought as an artist. In other performance cere-
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N036'/>monials the artifact remains as art object. But Chedva’s sugges-
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N037'/>tion was perfect for the intent of this piece. &quot;Yes Chedva, let&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that Mamita had been a very beautiful
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>young woman, and she had never fully
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>recovered from losing her looks. My
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>grandfather, whom everyone called a
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>saint, pampered her in everything and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tolerated her willfulness, so that the say-
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ing among the family was that Papito was
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>so good, “he peed holy water. Mamita
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was furious at hearing her husband
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>canonized at her expense, and she took
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>her revenge, bringing home a large jar of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>holy water from the cathedral with the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>explanation that she liked having it
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>around the house in case of spiritual
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>emergencies. Since she was not in the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>least bit religious, the family grew
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>suspicious.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>One Sunday during the weekly family
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>dinner, Mother caught Mamita preparing
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>my grandfather’s whiskey and water with
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>holy water from the jar. “Damn it!” my
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>grandmother gloated. “You all say he
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>pees holy water, well he’s been peeing it
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>all right!&quot;

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In New York, my grandfather devel
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>oped stomach ailments and from then
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>on all the foods in the world were di
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>vided into those which agreed and those
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>which did not agree with him. My grand

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>giously, feeling perhaps guilty about
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>earlier things she had run through his
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>system.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>When they did return from their
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>New York City trips, Mamita brought
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>back duffle bags full of toys for her
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>grandchildren. Once she honored me
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>with a magnificent noisy drum and once
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>with a watercolor set and paintbrushes
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of different thicknesses for expressing
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the grand and fine things in the world.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>My American cowgirl outfit was an exact
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>duplicate—except for the skirt—of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Ique’s cowboy one.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>My mother disapproved. The outfit
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>would only encourage my playing with
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Ique and the boys. It was high time I got
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>over my tomboy phase and started acting
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>like a young lady. “But it is for girls, I
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>pointed out. “Boys don’t wear skirts.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Mamita threw her head back and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>laughed. “This one is no fool. She’s as

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>On her latest trip to New York City, my
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>grandmother had taken her unmarried
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>daughter Titi along. Titi was known as
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the genius in the family” because she
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>read books and knew Latin and had at

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>out because too much education might
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>spoil her for marriage. The two years

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>however, for at twenty-eight, Titi was an

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>The day Titi marries, cows will fly, we
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cousins teased. I did not think any less of
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>my aunt for being single. In fact, as a tom
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>boy, I had every intention of following in
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>her footsteps. But Titi used her free time
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>so poorly, she might as well have been
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>married. She read and read, and for
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>breaks, she tended an incredible Eden of
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a garden, then read again.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>She reads tons and tons of books!

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>to rope someone into marrying her. I
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was not in the least bit interested in ac
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>quiring a new uncle or in wearing a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>dress for the occasion, but it would be
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>worth putting up with both inconven

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to us.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>I got a book of stories in English I
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>could barely read, with interesting pic
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tures, though, of a girl in a bra and long
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>slip with a little cap on her head that had
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a tassel dangling down. “That’s Schehera-

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>keep herself alive.” I knew, of course,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that the book was meant to encourage
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>me to read, just as I had been sent to the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>American school in hopes that they
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>might make a scholar out of me. In a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>world full of interesting people and all
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>kinds of interesting things, to sit down
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and read about them rather than experi
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ence them! No one could convince me
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>that that was a smart thing to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Ique fared much better, I thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with a see-through doll, whose top half
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>lifted off, and inside were blue and pink
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and light brown tubes and coils and odd
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>shaped pellets which all fit snugly to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>gether like a puzzle. Titi explained the

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to do with themselves when they grew
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>up, Ique had expressed an interest in the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>medical profession. Everyone thought
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that was very good of him and proved he
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>had a good heart after all, but Ique had
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>confided in me later that he was mostly
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>interested in giving needles and cutting
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>people open on the operating table.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>We examined the Human Body doll
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>while Titi read out loud from a little
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>booklet that came with it about the dif-
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ferent organs and what each was good
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>for. After we’d learned to put them to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>gether so the heart wasn’t tangled in the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>intestines and the lungs didn’t face the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>spine, Ique began to grumble. “A doll,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>why’d she get me a stupid doll?
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>I disliked them too, but this doll was
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>better than a reading book and you
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>could own it with self-respect, seeing as
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>it was a boy with guts. But I was surprised
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>that along with his other organs, this boy
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>didn’t have what in those days I called “a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>pe-er.” l’d seen them on little naked beg
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>gar boys at the market and once on the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>same grandfather who peed holy water
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>when I walked in on him in the bath
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>room ministering to his need. But this
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>doll was as smooth between his legs as a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>baby girl.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Mamita, who yearned for her youth
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>again, must have remembered what it

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>loving. She had snuck back for us—
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>when Titi’s back was turned—little
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>nonsense presents. I got a paddle with a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>little ball attached on an elastic string
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>which I whacked and whammed as if it
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>were my reading book, and Ique got a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>big packet of bright pink modeling clay
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>At first, neither of us knew what the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>packet was. My cousin’s eyes blazed like
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>shiny coins. &quot;Bubble gum !&quot; he cried out.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>But my grandmother explained that no,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>this was a new kind of modeling clay that
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was easy to work with. She demon-
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>strated. Pulling off a handful, she molded
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a ball, bunched little ears side by side
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>dotted two eyes with a bobby pin she
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>took out of her hair and finished it off
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>with a tiny ball of a tail. She held her
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>hand out to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>“Ah,” I cried, for in her palm was the
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>likeness of a tiny rabbit.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>But Ique was not impressed. Bunny or
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>not, he still could not blow bubbles
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Then the rabbit was rolled back
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>into a pink ball in Grandmother&apos;s palm
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Next came a small basket with a braided
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>handle in which you could actually in
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>sert a penny, and then a many-petaled

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>garden. I marveled at this pink clay. At
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>school, the clay was gray and tough to

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>did linger a moment over the pictures of

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>At that, I drew myself up with

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>through a path in the hedges and then
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>lingered by my side as I sat on a patio

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>my book. He paced by me several times,

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>hand like a baseball. “What nice clay,” he
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>observed. “Very nice clay.” I kept my eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>on my book.

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>once, twice around his shoulders like a

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>he passed within inches of me, through
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the hedges to his own side of the large

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wrapped the snake around and around

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>In a panic, little Teresita reached out to

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Ique unwound one end and poked it at
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>her. The small girl screamed and scam

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>heels, dangling the snake before him.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>They crossed the patio of their house,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and then Teresita fled indoors. In a

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>calling out, “Manuel Enrique Rodriguez

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Ique blocked her path. He pinched off a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>bit of clay from the coil in his hands.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>&quot;Want some?” he offered.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I was beside myself. He wouldn’t even

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wards him and pushing little Elsa aside.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Okay, okay. He motioned for me to
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>lower my voice. He wadded the snake
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>back into a ball and held it out to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Trade you. My heart soared. I began
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>bargaining indiscriminately. At last, he
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>asked, &quot;You got any gum?
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I shook my head. Now I saw what
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>worm had been gnawing at him all
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>morning. He had never recovered from
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the clay not being the Bazooka he had set
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>his heart on. His desire was as deep as
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>mine for his clay, and I knew I would
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>have to satisfy it in order to get that clay.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I made one last desperate offer. &quot;You
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>can have anything you want.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Ique considered for a moment. A dirty
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>little smile spread across his lips. It was a
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>like a liquid spilling and staining some
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>thing it mustn’t. “Anything?” I nodded.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>He lowered his voice. “Show me you re

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;Huh?” I said.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>His eyes came to rest on the lap of my

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I looked around, stalling. My eyes fell
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>on little Elsa, who was following the

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>At the door of the shed I gave her a little

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Oh, let her in,” Ique argued. “She’ll

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>T’Il tell,” Elsa agreed.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>I wanted to pounce on her right then
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and there, but I didn’t dare ruin my
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>chances at acquiring the packet of clay.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Instead, I narrowed my eyes and gave

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>her little knowing nods before entering

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the nods said. Just you wait.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>It was dark and damp inside. A faint
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>light fell through the dirty wire-mesh
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>windows. The air smelled of rich black
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>soil brought down from the mountains
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to make Aunt Titi’s giant ferns grow tall.

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>them down.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Immediately, little Elsa pulled down
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>her pants and panties in one wad to hei

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>his shoulders with disappointment.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;You’re just like dolls,” he observed and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>divided his ball of clay equally between
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Elsa and me.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I was dressed in a minute and lit into

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Ique tried hushing my angry yelling
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>He reached over to take back Elsita’s half
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>but she too started bawling. “Come on
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>please,” he pleaded with me. “Please. I&apos;II

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I considered a moment, then nodded
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and he fled out of the shed in search of
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>his toy.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Elsa sniffled as she patted her half into
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>a small clay ball. She looked over at the

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>you got?
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I glared at Elsa. She was still standing
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in a puddle of fabric at her ankles. She
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>had a smear of breakfast egg on her chin
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and the blurry eyes of someone who has
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>just stopped crying. I reached over and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>pulled her pants back up. She swayed
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with the force of my lifting. &quot;How much
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>you got?” she persisted. In her eyes was a
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>gleam of material interest I hadn’t no

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>I held up my half to hers. “Saine as

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Soon after this pink clay incident,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Ique and the boys were settling teams for
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>a baseball game. There was an odd num
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ber of boys in the family, so I usually was
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>picked up at the end to round out the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>teams.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Today, there was an even number of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>boys—one or another cousin was home
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with a fever, a sure sign we’d all be bed
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ridden within the week. Back and forth
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Captain Ique and Captain Jongi selected
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>from best to worst of the boy players, un
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>til only I was left.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;What about me?” I reminded Ique,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sure he’d make a case for me. After all, I
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was a good hitter, an excellent catcher,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and had strong lungs for cheering on my
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>team. Ique hesitated, and the group
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sensed his divided loyalties. A larger
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>number than usual echoed that first cry
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of &quot;Girls! We don’t want to play with stu-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>pid girls.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I looked at Ique, my eyes pleading
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>with him, but he merely shrugged and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>held his empty hands out, palms up.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Off they went, even-Stevens, not one
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>longing or repentant look over his
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>shoulder from my cousin Ique. I stood
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>awhile in that yard, around the bend
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>from where the group was playing, so I
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>could not see the progress of their game
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>or have my tears remarked. I heard
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>scores being shouted; one or another
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>player urged to strike or not strike.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>wanted to wreak a terrible revenge on
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>boys, and especially on my cousin Ique.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>But I could think of nothing that would
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>equal the pain I felt at that moment. I
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>turned towards the house, looking for
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>someone sympathetic who might listen
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to my side of the story.

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I was born in 1933 and brought up
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>near La India mines in central Nicaragua,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in the Department of Leon. The mines
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>were the property of North Americans. It
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was a small town; everybody knew each
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>other and everybody understood what
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was going on. The life I lived there was
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>an important factor, a determinant of my
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>political awareness of Nicaragua as a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>whole, because in seeing the injustices
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and the poverty I saw as a girl, I came to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>understand much later—between thirty
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>eight and forty years of age—that there
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>were profound political reasons for this,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>that it was a necessity for the government
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to keep people under conditions of pov-
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>erty in order to control them.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The workers in the mines made only
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>three cordobas a day, which at that time
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was like five cents. My father was not a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>miner, but one of my uncles was. I saw a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lot of people sick with silicosis, their
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>lungs almost covered by dirt and dust.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Every time one of these miners died,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>some money was given to the family as a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>pension, but half of it went to Somoza. I
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>never understood the reason that hap

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N020'/>eventually would permit me to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N021'/>life that was a little more decent
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N022'/>So at the age of fifteen I became a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N023'/>dressmaker. I began learning the skill a

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N025'/>ing my own living. At eighteen I got mar
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N026'/>ried and my husband and I went to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N027'/>Managua, where I worked in a private
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N028'/>shop owned by a rich family, though
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N029'/>also worked in a more familiar shop ir
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N030'/>my own neighborhood in the evenings
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N031'/>The clothes were made for the rich peo
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N032'/>ple, and while working in that environ
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N033'/>ment I began to listen to these ladies
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N034'/>conversations and heard everything they
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N035'/>would discuss about the workers

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N038'/>dren had been born, I began to integrate
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N039'/>myself into the community of San Pablo
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N040'/>Apostol. We would meet there in a clan
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N041'/>destine way to discuss politics; some
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N042'/>priests from Spain had arrived to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N043'/>working with people at the grass-roots
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>level within the church. However, this
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>experiment in the parish came to the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>knowledge of Monsignor Obando
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Bravo, who then tried to expel these
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>priests from the country
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I learned a lot of things by being part
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of the religious community, and I began
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to raise my political consciousness. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>thirty-seven, thirty-eight when I began to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>realize that all the poverty that had beer
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with me since childhood was a conse
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>quence of the political system in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Nicaragua.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Between 1970 and 1971 the youth
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>started taking over churches, and we be
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>gan to help them. The young men would
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>go in the church, and once inside, they
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>would just close the door. Then we
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>would go out and send them back fooc
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and drinks. Under Somoza it was very
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>difficult to get everyone in the religious
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>community involved in this movement
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>We would have meetings of politica
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>groups. We studied the Bible and lots of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>people went, but when they began to uti
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>lize Biblical teachings to refer to the con
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>temporary political situation, the people
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>would become afraid and leave, because
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>in Somoza’s time you couldn’t use those
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>words, you couldn’t talk about those
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>things in those terms, you couldn’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>groups meeting. So we would do it clan-
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>destinely—underground. Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>we met at our own houses and some
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>times in the church. Not many people
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>would know about it. What we did was to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>study the Bible and try to compare it with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the reality of our lives
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Already, by 1972, my more mature
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>children—I have four sons and two
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>daughters—were involved in the com
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>munity-based political groups. I wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>my children to study a profession, but l
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>knew that, in Nicaragua as it was under
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Somoza, they wouldn’t have any scholar
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ships, and we had no money to put them
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in universities. So, because of the eco
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>nomic situation, we came to the United
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>States, and here I began working with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the church of Santa Barbara in Brooklyn
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>For four years I gave religious instruc
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tion and taught the Bible and catechism
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>It was in doing this—because I had to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>visit women living alone, women living
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>on welfare, and single women with chil
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dren—that I started seeing all the misery
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the poverty, and the alienation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>people who lived in this country I always
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>kept in communication with the people
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in my communities in Nicaragua and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>kept up with what was happening there
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and in 1978 we started doing solidarity
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>work with Nicaragua.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>When my family and I came here
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>we found it much more difficult than we
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>had thought it would be. We didn’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the language, and we didn’t understand
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the laws. We did have a son already at
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Cornell who was a very good student and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was lucky enough to have a scholarship
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and his living here made it easier for the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>rest of us to come and be residents. The
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>universities here had told us that with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>what my husband and I were making, we
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>would be able to pay for the education os
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>our other children. But this was not the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>reality. Both of us together were making
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>only §14,000 a year after income tax.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>I worked at a factory on 28th Street be
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tween 7th and 8th, making pants. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>able to do everything, all the parts—zip
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>pers, all of it—but it was always a misery
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>what I earned. They would pay 24 cents
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>to sew one pair of pants. In order to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>make at least 530, I would have to make
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>at least two hundred pairs of pants.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I came from my country with a politi

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>country. I started talking with people
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>from Puerto Rico, Santo Domingo, and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>elsewhere in Central America and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>started asking questions about their
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>countries. I never understood why it was
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that the people from Puerto Rico and the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Dominican Republic were so much
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>more conscious than the others. Maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the conditions there allowed that to hap-

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>there had been so much repression.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>My children would work during the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>day and study in the evenings. Most of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>them are now back in Nicaragua. One

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to participate in the literacy campaign.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>He and our son who had studied philos

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>What I am doing now is working
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>with Casa Nicaragua in New York, where
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Iam part of the coordinating committee

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>It was after the triumph of the Revolu-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tion that women began to have opportu-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>nities for participation. Before, they
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>were not integrated into Nicaraguan so-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ciety, and now all women—at all social
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>levels—participate within the revolu
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>tionary government. For myself, I feel
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>very positive about taking on these new
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>kinds of responsibilities. I feel that
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>through the revolutionary process
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>women began to fulfill themselves and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>to achieve a little emancipation. Logically
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>it can’t yet be total, but as the process ad-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>vances, women also advance with it.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Of course, changing into the new
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>woman is difficult. For me, for example,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>the experience of this change didn’t hap-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>pen from one day to the next. Many
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>women have experienced this phase in
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Nicaragua. For many of them, their chil

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>the struggle—went to fight, and at a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>given time, they backed up their chil

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>revolutionary process themselves. They
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>began to feel that they too have the right
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to be free, to be creative, to demonstrate
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that they have talent and that they could
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>contribute a lot to the society. Many
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women entered into the revolution as
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>mothers, but others fought in a different
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>aspect, as when AMPRUNACS began.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>AMPRUNACS was the first women’s

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>peasants’ deaths and all the barbaric
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>things committed by Somoza. At the time
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>AMPRUNACS sprang up, it was made up
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of professional women belonging to the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>petit bourgeoisie. These were the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women that Somoza feared the most, be
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>cause they were of his own class level.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Many of these women were mothers, but
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>others were young professionals who
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>saw the great injustices which were hap-

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>youngsters and of the peasants. At first
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>they started protesting against so many

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>grass-roots base. That&apos;s when they began
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to work as couriers, as nurses, as grass
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>roots organizers to raise consciousness.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>during the insurrection, but at the same
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>time, women began to take part in the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>pròcess as a whole and began to gain
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>consciousness. They began to work on
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>all the aspects needed during the insur

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>tire nation. It was definitely very
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>important, the women’s participation.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Others integrated into the struggle
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>only to die young, fighting, like Luisa

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Claudia Chamorro, like so many, many
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>others. Many others were raped, tor
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tured, massacred, and jailed for a long
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>time—like Dora Maria, like Doris Ti-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>jerino (now head of the Sandinista po-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lice), who many times was jailed,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tortured, and everything. We began to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>see that the Nicaraguan woman, by fight-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ing in the forefront of combat, gained
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>her rights to participate in all aspects of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>society.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>And all this goes on supporting the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>revolutionary process, because in Nica
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ragua there is a new man who is evoly-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ing, but at the same time the new
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>woman” is evolving also—a woman with
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a different perspective on life, not
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>merely the woman who had been only
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the instrument for the man, a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>doubly exploited. Now there is a new
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>woman who can make her own deci-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sions, a woman who can decide what-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ever she wants in life.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Many women are going out for mili-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tary training and to fight or to work, and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>some men are now staying home. There
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>is now a responsible paternity” law un-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>der which women can make decisions
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>about the lives of their children, where
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>before it was the case that permission
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>had to be asked of the father. Another
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>part of this law is that if a man ends the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>relationship with a woman, he has to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>give economic support for the children,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and this is changing a lot of things in the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ways that they relate to each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>In my own personal example, my hus

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>five years. If I have a problem with my
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>husband, I am now free to tell him to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>leave. Before, he used to say, “From the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>door of the house out, I am a totally free
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>human being. I am married from the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>door in. When I became involved with
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the Nicaraguan women’s association
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>AMNLAE and all the other groups, he
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>used to comment that there was a change
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>in me. Now he accepts it, even in cases
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>where I have to go to another state to
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>give a talk and stay overnight.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>He never understood how much care
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>a child needed; he never assumed that
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>that was something you had to do. Now
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>he says, &quot;How much work! How could
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>you do it? Six children!” In other times, if
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>I would leave, he would never cook any-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>thing for himself, but now he just fixes
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>whatever he can when l’m not around.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>It’s all new for him, but he understands
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_5_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>perfectly well that these changes are for

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of the night, someone to hold her close.

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>was still in pain, pains all over. When

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>her livingroom. Olive kept up a strong
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>conversation, particularly about the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>smells, the smells, the smells.

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>On a Saturday at the beginning of De-

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>through the emergency room. The snow
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>drifts melted with a sudden show of sun
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>shine. It was difficult getting her admit

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>in authority. No one wanted to admit Ol

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Olive winked roguishly at Andrea.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Golda Meier has a friend?
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Yes! A good friend, boyfriend, a man

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>free and she will marry him and they will
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>settle down and she will be a balabusta,

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Mom keeps a good home,” Meredith
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>said.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Olive was in obvious undifferentiated

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that originated nowhere. She swayed to

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;She is in pain, Andrea insisted.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Can’t you see she needs help?” asked
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Meredith. Tears streamed from Mere
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dith’s eyes. “What should we do? Mom,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>what should we do?
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Andrea and Meredith walked out on
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Olive that Saturday night. They left her.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Olive was not yet admitted but lay
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>stretched out on the table, her belong
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ings piled like rags, a body unidentified
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>left there like on a slab, asleep and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>feverish.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>You did right to leave her,” soothed
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Barnaby.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I felt so bad.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Of course you did.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The fever persisted. No one knew
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>what Olive suffered from. All the tests
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>proved negative. She was deemed to
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>have nothing, only the fever that fluctu
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ated, came and went for no reason that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>any doctor could fathom.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>&quot;My family is taking me home,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>claimed Olive.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Olive went off to the nursing home
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>with no one from the family in atten
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>dance. She was placed in a wheelchair
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>when a room became available. All her
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>possessions dumped into a paper bag
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were heaped on her lap. She was
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wheeled down the corridor. Her hat was
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>placed precariously atop her head.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>You know I always use a hat pin, she
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>complained as she rested quietly in her
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>bed when Andrea went to see her. The
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>bed was covered with a pretty white
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>blanket with rosebuds. The walls of the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>room were painted a soft orange and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>green. When Olive opened her eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>again, she smiled at her daughter and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>grinned at the blanket. Both Olive and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Andrea seemed pacified by the rosebud
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>print blanket. Olive smiled and went
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>back to sleep. Andrea left her.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Andrea brought her mother clothing
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and a magic marker to keep in the draw-
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>er in the side table in her room so that all
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>her possessions could be marked.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;Just like when you went to camp,

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Soon. Later. Some other time.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Olive rocked herself in her wheel
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>chair. Back and forth, back and forth she
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>moved her bulk on the pivot of her hip.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Davenning? Prayer? She pulled on her

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Exercising, said Olive. She pulled on
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>her fingers one at a time as she at
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tempted to spread them fanlike. “Exer

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and massaged her hands, continuing to
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>pull out her fingers, cracking her bones.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>&quot;I won’t cost much, she promised, &quot;if
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>you take me home. I know I will get bet-

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>rises during the night. The bed rises dur
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ing the night and a band plays under it.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>All the loud sounds. All the old loud

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>whispered, “this place is full of comos.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>&quot;Comos?” Andrea asked.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>&quot;Comos, Olive whispered, indicating
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>the pale white forms that slid or slumped
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>in their wheelchairs, inertly paying at

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>A color TV blared. The square table
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>covers on the square tables were set up
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>for dinner. The aluminum refrigerated

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>They moved Olive to the second floor
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_7_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>where people were more active. Olive

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>When she was 104 she looked out of our

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Her leg swelled. There were sores on

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Olive sat huddled in her wheelchair,

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Olive was in a private room. Meredith
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>took her camera to the nursing home.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>She took pictures of her grandmother.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Olive posed. She had a sweet, pleased

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>It&apos;s all right, Olive.&quot; The nurses tried

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>The reason the help has it in for me is
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>that I was influential with the head nurse
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>in having a male attendant fired and the

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N039'/>could smell his breath. He had been

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>What school did you go to?
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>David stared at the soft spot underneath Kate’s left breast and

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>She returned to the headboard, placing David’s right arm over

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>leading to her left nipple. Having tied both wrists, Kate finished
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>with a firm square knot. David’s fingers reached for her—the

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>he only felt the silk hold on his hands. It was a blue tie, a deep
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>blue tie with tiny red dots. A gift from his aunt. He had never
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>particularly cared for it. The colors were too familiar, and most
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of his co-workers had similar ones. It was a very safe, conserva
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tive tie, fitting for the securely employed, recently arrived.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Kate’s hand passed over his right arm, the soft, pink, fleshy
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>inner arm with streaks of obscured blue showing the paleness of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>his skin. David looked up.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>He felt her hand slowly slip to the nape of his neck and saw

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Their bellies nearly touching, Kate began to kiss the side of his

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>It started several weeks ago. They agreed to meet for lunch

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>wine with lunch. Not very daring, but certainly provoking. When

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>satisfaction. They waved a cab down and David gave out his ad
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>dress, which was, conveniently, nearby.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The elevator was their first opportunity for unobserved inti
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>macy. When the car stopped, and the doors had not yet opened,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>David brushed his mouth over Kate’s right ear saying, “the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>right.” She wasn’t sure what he was referring to and when the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>elevator opened she lurched to the right, but not before leaving
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>a lasting impression on David’s upper right thigh.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Once in his apartment, they began to undress each other, leav-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing a trail of scattered clothing. David steered Kate into the bed
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>room and switched on the stereo as he passed it. The radio was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>on and as Kate pushed David’s trousers over his hips, she heard
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>“Whites off earth now.” They removed the last of their clothing.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>On her way to the bed, Kate skirted the dresser and saw a blue
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tie, silk maybe, nestled in tissue. Continuing to fondle David, she
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>grabbed the tie and began to think what she could do with a blue
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>silk tie.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>&quot;You’ve done this before, haven’t you?” David asked,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>still looking up, hands tied above his head. His fingers played
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with the metal spokes of the headboard. Kate bent over the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>wide-eyed David and she kissed him on the mouth. The kiss
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ended; the room was cold and she wanted something to cover
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>her bare rump. Turning around for the comforter, she saw the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>view out the window and went to it. David could only look at
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>how her back arched as she left the bed and went toward the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>window. She pressed her palm to the pane, feeling the cool of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the glass. It was late afternoon now. Traffic was picking up by the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>river, and if she twisted her head to the right she could follow the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>river almost to the bridge. The brick overhang of the corner
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>blocked the rest of the view. Kate felt colder standing by the win-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>dow. She wrapped her arms around her belly, her hands tucked
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>into the niches of her elbows, and looked down at the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>streetlights.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>David tried to decide what to do. He thought this was a joint
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>venture, but maybe the idea of being tied up like this was surren-
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>der. Maybe he was supposed to do nothing, or be able to do
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>nothing. Just then, Kate returned to the bed, smiled and gave
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>David, who had resolved that he would do nothing, a small,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>pressing kiss. Raising herself off the bed, she reached to the floor
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>for her stockings and left the room. On her way to the door Kate
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>dressed, gathering lingerie, her skirt and blouse from where
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>they were tossed. Her coat and shoes were by the door, and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>when she was assembled, she turned the lock and walked out,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>shutting the door behind her.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>David heard the lock turn and door shut. “Well,” he thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>perhaps this is part of it.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>When Kate got to the street she turned around, looked
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>up, counted five stories, three windows to the right and saw
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>David’s bedroom was dark. Silk is supple, she remembered, and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>her knots almost always loosened. She went on to the corner
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>and waited for the traffic light to change. Putting one gloved
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>hand into a coat pocket, the other pushing blond hair behind
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>her left ear, she thought that would be the last time she would
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>have wine for lunch.

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>told me he was seventy-two, but he
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>wasn’t any taller than I am and I just
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>turned eleven. Last summer I was ten,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and when he took his baseball cap off,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the tops of our heads lined up. Now l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>eleven, and if he weren’t dead, maybe l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>be as tall as he is even with his baseball
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cap on.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I wish Boris wasn’t dead. Leslie is in
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Nantucket. Christopher is in camp. Jean
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Louis and Nicole think I’m a sissy be
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>cause Mommy worries l’Il get run over if
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>play in the street with them. The old
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ladies in black that knit by the little
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>chapel give me the creeps. I don’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>many other people to talk to here in
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>France. Often, I talk to Johanna but if I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>giggle with her too much, Mommy gets
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mad. Mommy gets jealous or something.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Like yesterday, when Johanna was telling
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>me a story about being eleven years old
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in Germany, and Mommy came in and
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>made that clicking noise with her tongue
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and asked why, since it was already eight
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>o’clock, I hadn’t been sent to her room to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>say good-night
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Now, I wish Boris was still alive. I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>guess, for a while, I did sort of wish he
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>was dead. I mean, I told Leslie, my winter
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>best friend, that I wished Boris was dead.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Ishould never have said that. I hope Les-
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lie never, ever tells anyone. When I get
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>back I’II make her promise not to. It’ll
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>have to be my Big Secret.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Johanna told me that everyone has a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Big Secret. Her Big Secret is that, though
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>she loves me very much, she would
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>rather have been an actress than a little
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>girl’s governess.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I don’t know why Boris died. I asked
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Johanna why, and she said, &quot;He was old,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>liebchen.” Liebchen sort of means dar
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ling&apos; in German and that is what Johanna
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>likes to call me when she feels sorry for
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>me. She wouldn’t feel so sorry for me if
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she d&apos;heard what I told Leslie, but I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>think that&apos;s what made Boris die. I mean,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>he couldn’t have died just because I told
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Leslie that I kind of wished he was dead. I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>wonder if he had his baseball cap on
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>when he died. I think he wore it all the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>time. Once he asked me if I wanted it. I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>said yes, and wore it at his house while I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>drank my grenadine, but then I gave it
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>back to him when Johanna picked me up
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>because I knew Mommy wouldn’t let me
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>wear it at home.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>I won’t get to wear his cap and drink
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>grenadine with him anymore. I won’t get
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to hear him read the stories that he wrote
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>for me and about me—like the one he
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>called “Rebecca and the Lion, where!
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>save a gentle lion from a mean lion
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tamer—and I won’t be able to read him
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the stories I make up—like the one
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>called “Annette and Alicia, where a fam
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ily adopts an orphaned girl because their
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>daughter is an only child and lonely, or
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Annette and Alicia Run Away, where the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>two girls run away to the circus because
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>they don’t like their mother. He’ll never
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>call me “My poetess, Rebecca again. Jo-
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>hanna told me that a poetess was a girl
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>poet and that the name should make me
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>very proud. Boris started calling me that
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>when I was about seven and a half, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>showed him a poem about a hamster that
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Dariel Dodge had given me for my
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>seventh birthday but that Mommy had
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>said was dirty and made me give back to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Dariel. You know, he shouldn’t really
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>have continued to call me “My poetess,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Rebecca because I didn’t write many
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>more poems. I guess he could have
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>called me his painter, Rebecca, since it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>already been a long time since he started
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>letting me use his paints.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Last summer and the summer before
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and the summer before and the summer
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>before and even before that, Boris and I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>painted together. l’d make up something
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and paint it, like a faraway hilly place
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>where it rained pink rain or a stupid
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>looking blue goose with green and or
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ange feet, and Boris would return to an
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>oil painting he’d begun before l’d ar-
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>rived. Usually a painting of a naked lady.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Now my mother has those kinds of pic
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tures at home, so I guess a lot of people
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>like painting them. Still, Leslie told me it
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was gross to have naked people on the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>wall. I asked Mommy if that was true and
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>she said, Not if it&apos;s art.&quot; Then I told Boris
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>what Mommy had said, and he laughed
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and answered, “Who cares about art? I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>like having pretty models around.” I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>asked him what he meant. He said he
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>needed them around so he could see
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>what he was painting. I was really sur-
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>prised when he said that. I guess l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>always figured that he made those
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ladies up.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>I can’t believe that I can’t go paint with
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Boris this summer. When I told Leslie I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>hated him now and wanted him to die, I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>really didn’t mean it. I don’t know any-
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>one else who likes to paint. I wonder if
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Mommy cried when she found out Boris
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>was dead. I know shes known him
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>forever. That’s why she lets him give me
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>what she calls art classes.” Johanna told
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N001'/>barbara friedman is an artist living in new york city.
			</p>
			<pb n='94'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>me that Mommy’s known Boris since she
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was a little girl, since he first left Russia
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>for France. It&apos;s funny that Boris is Russian
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and wears a baseball cap.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>When I told Leslie that my best friend
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>during the summer was named Boris
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Smirnoff, that he was Russian, that he was
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>very old, that he wasn’t much taller than I
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>am, that he wore a baseball cap, that he
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>painted naked ladies, and that he let me
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>drink as much grenadine as I wanted,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Leslie said that he must be a Communist.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I asked Mommy if Leslie was right, and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>she said no, he’s a White Russian. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Johanna’s day off so I couldn’t ask her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>what a White Russian was. Instead, I
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>asked daddy when he got home. He
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>said a White Russian was a drink.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Mommy made that clicking noise with
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>her tongue and said he wasn’t funny. I
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>didn’t think he was funny either except
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that Mommy never thinks he’s funny and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Iusually do.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Mommy doesn’t think much is funny.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>She’s French and that’s why we go to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>France every summer. Daddy’s Ameri
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>can, and that’s why we live in New York
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>most of the year. Boris is Russian but he
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>lives in France instead of Russia because
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>he’s a White Russian. I finally told Leslie
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that Boris wasn’t a Communist, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>said, &quot;So what? Johanna is a Nazi. She&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>German, isn’t she?” I asked Johanna if
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>she was a Nazi, and she started crying. I
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>told Leslie about it and Leslie said she
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>didn’t care, all Germans wereJew-haters.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Once when Johanna screamed at me I
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>called her a Jew-hater. She cried again
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and I felt bad.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Iguess I miss Leslie. But she thinks she
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>knows everything and sometimes she’s
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>wrong. Like, in first grade when Leslie
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>said that Mommy was divorced because
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>she wasn’t American. Johanna told me
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>that Leslie was definitely wrong. Mommy
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>wasn’t American but she wasn’t divorced
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>either. She was married to Daddy.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Now, I know that Leslie wasn’t all
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>wrong. Mommy isn’t divorced, she is
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>married to Daddy, but she did have an
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>other husband before Daddy, before me.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>I found that out last summer from Chris
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>topher. I found out a lot of things last
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>summer. Christopher is my age and he&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>English, but he lives here in France with
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>his grandparents. They live down the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>street from Boris. He’s my second-best
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>summer friend, after Boris. I’m talking
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>about when Boris was still my summer
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>best friend, before I stopped liking him
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>and, of course, before he died. Anyway,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Christopher is in camp this summer and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>that’s one ofthe reasons l’m so lonely So,
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>here’s what happened. Christopher had
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>come over for lunch or something—this
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>was early last summer—and he pointed
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>to those red geraniums, the ones planted
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>right in the middle of the garden, and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>said real loud that that was where my
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>mother had buried her first husband
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>The one she’d set fire to. The one she’c
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>burned to death. I told Christopher that
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>he was stupid, that his mother was fat and
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>didn’t want him, and that’s why she gave
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>him to his grandparents. Christopher hit
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>me kind of hard and left. I asked Mommy
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>if she had had another husband and, if
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>so, had she burned him to death?
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>Mommy didn’t cry or get mad or say it
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>wasn’t true. She didn’t even make that
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>clicking sound with her tongue. She just
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>said something like, where does that
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>child get such wild ideas? I asked Jo
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>hanna if that was Mommy’s Big Secret. Jo
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>hanna said she wasn’t sure if it was her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>Big Secret, but that Mommy had not

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>burned her first husband, he’d been cre-
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>mated and his ashes were in a box in the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>garden. Then Johanna told me what be-
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ing cremated was and how many people
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>prefer that to letting their corpse rot
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>away. I don’t know how I’II feel. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>want worms to eat my body but I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>really want to be burned either. I do
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>know, though, that if I had my husband&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ashes in a box in my garden it would be
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>my Big Secret.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I know Boris’ Big Secret. The last time
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I saw him, he said, “Now, Rebecca, lets
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>keep this our Big Secret. I didn’t exactly
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>know why it was supposed to be our Big
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Secret, but I agreed to keep it. I think I
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>know more now and that’s why I told Les-
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>lie in school this year that I sort of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wished Boris would die. And now
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>he has.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I’m back in France and he’s not here.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>It&apos;s the beginning of another summer va-

			<pb n='95'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>cation, and the very last time I saw him
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>was two days before the end of last sum
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mer’s vacation. Johanna had dropped me
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>off at his house before lunchtime. He
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>had salami and peaches ready. I drank
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lots of grenadine and started to com
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>plain about stuff to him. I always loved to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>complain about things to Boris. When I
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was eight, I complained that my nose was
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>too wide—a little broad, Mommy hac
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>said—and Boris told me to sleep with a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>clothespin on it for a month. Johanna
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>found out pretty soon and wouldn’t let
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>me do it anymore. Mommy never found
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>out. But I think it worked, I think my
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>nose is thinner. Anyway, that day I told
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Boris about how Jean-Louis and Nicole
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>got to drink wine and coffee and play in
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the village streets ’til it got dark outside
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and how, of course, I didn’t get to do any
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of those things. Boris told me that thein
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>wine was mostly water, their coffee was
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>filled with milk and that, anyway, they
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>were French and I wasn’t. I said, so what.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Mommy’s French, isn’t she? Then, Boris
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>said, yes she is, but their mother is more
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>relaxed than yours. He said that my
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>mother was never very relaxed, ever
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>when she was young, and that if she had
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>been, she and he might have had a good
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>time together. I asked him what he
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>meant by a good time and he smiled and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>instead of answering my question, said
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that I sort of looked like Mommy Then,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>asked him if he’d ever painted Mommy
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>He said, “Sure, many times. He askec
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>me if I wanted to see a painting of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Mommy when she was a lot younger and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I said, &quot;Yes, l’d love to. So, he went to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>his back room and came back with a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>painting of a lady that sort of looked like
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Mommy. Except the lady was naked
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Boris asked me if I liked it. I said I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>know. He’d told me before that the hu-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>man body was wonderful to paint, and to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>paint it well you had to look at it hard.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>And that you couldn’t paint someone
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with clothes on if you didn’t understand
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>what they looked like with their clothes
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>off. But this was Mommy with her clothes
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>off. I think that then Boris asked me if I
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>thought that Mommy had had a pretty
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>body I said I guessed so. He said, “Would
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you look at those great breasts and that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wonderful mound between her I
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>asked him what he meant by a wonderful
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>mound, and he said that when little girls
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>became women they grow a triangle of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>hair between their legs. I said I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>have any hair there. He said, oh, are you
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sure, can I take a look? I said I guessed so.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I pulled my shorts and underpants off
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and he bent way down to look. He
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>looked very closely—like he d told me
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>you have to look at something when
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>you’re going to paint it—and said, no,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>you don’t have any hair there yet. But you
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>will. Then I felt him lick me where he
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>said I would get hair and I felt very
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>strange. He asked me if I knew how chil-
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>dren were made and I told him that Les-
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>lie had said you put two seeds in a lady&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>stomach. Boris said, no, that wasn’t really
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>it. I said that actually Christopher had
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>said something about going to the bath
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>room together a few years ago, but his
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>grandmother had walked in right away.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Boris said that Christopher was quite a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>little man, and I put on my shorts, and he
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>went to get me some more grenadine.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Then we sat down to paint and he said,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>this will be our secret, Okay?
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>I kept our secret, but last fall, after I got
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>back to New York and to school and to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Leslie, I stopped liking Boris as much. I
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>felt weird about his painting Mommy na
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ked and I felt weird about his licking me
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>there.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>One day at recess, I told Leslie that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Boris wasn’t my summer best friend any
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>more. I didn’t tell her why, and she said it
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>was because he was a Communist. That
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>shows how much she knows! I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>bother to tell her how dumb she is some
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>times, I just said that I sort of wished that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Boris would get sick and drop dead.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>And then Leslie—Leslie, of all people
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>looked shocked and said that you should
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>never, ever say that about anyone, not
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>even about Communists or Nazis. I guess
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>she had a point because, now, Boris is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>dead, and it&apos;s really, really important that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>no one ever know what I said to Leslie. I
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>must remember first thing when I get
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>back to tell her that it’s our Big Secret and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_6_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>that she absolutely has to keep it.

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>•Sixteen million women in the United States are over the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>age of 64. By the year 2005, there will be 25 million.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>• Eighty percent of people over the age of 65 who live alone are
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women. In this age group, there are five times more widows
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>than widowers.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>• Over half of all women over the age of 65 live on 8550 a month
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>or less.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>• Over two million people are providing unpaid care for frail el-

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Besides the alarming economic reality and increasing isola
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tion they face, older women also struggle for personal dignity
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>against demeaning stereotypes. In our culture, older women are
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>usually portrayed as ugly, wicked, miserable, or pathetic. From

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Over 200 women in the Bay Area were interviewed to help
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>crystallize the focus of ACTING OUR AGE and to find the six
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women who are featured in the film. Organizations such as The
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Gray Panthers, The Older Women’s League, Options for Women
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>over 40, and many local senior centers helped make the contacts
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>for these interviews.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Funding for ACTING OUR AGE came from more than four-
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>teen foundations, and from several hundred individuals who
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>contributed to the film at different work-in-progress screenings

				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>A SYNOPSIS
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The six women in Acting Our Age come from diverse racial.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ethnic, and class backgrounds, and have varied kinds of relation
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ships with mates, family, and community. They speak candidly
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>about topics rarely discussed openly by any of us but which are
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>especially taboo for older women in our culture: changes in
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>their looks, aloneness, sexuality, money, death.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The film opens with a sequence of old women dancing. We
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>see full shots of the group intercut with close-ups of faces, hands,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>arms, and feet. This scene dissolves into illustrations of old hags
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>from fairy tales. We hear a mother’s voice reading fairy tales

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>people in their teens and twenties that were dead. It depends on
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>your outlook. I worked with a teenager who I took for about 30.

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>as they used to do, but women are different anyway. They&apos;re
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>physically different. They think differently. Why would they
