				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>called art can have a political impact, and that in the making of art and of all
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cultural artifacts our identities as women play a distinct role. We hope that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>theory, encourage the writing of the history of femina sapiens, and generate
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>new creative energies among women. It will be a place where diversity can be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>articulated. We are committed to the broadening of the definition and func
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tion of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; our fields include painting,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architec
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ture and filmmaking. While the themes of the individual issues will be deter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mined by the collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>up of women who want to work on that issue as well as members of the collec
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tive. Proposals for issues may be conceived and presented to the HERESIES
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Collective by groups of women not associated with the collective. Each issue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>will take a different visual form, chosen by the group responsible. HERESIES
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>will try to be accountable to and in touch with the international feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>community. An open evaluation meeting will be held after the appearance of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>each issue. Topics for issues will be announced well in advance in order to col
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lect material from many sources. It is possible that satellite pamphlets and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>broadsides will be produced continuing the discussion of each central theme.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>In addition, HERESIES provides training for women who work editorially, in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>design and in production, both on-the-job and through workshops.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>lives, our arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>clarified they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and audience, and to understand the relationship between art and politics,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we reject the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>standard relationship of criticism to art within the present system, which has
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>often become the relationship of advertiser to product. We will not advertise a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>new set of genius-products just because they are made by women. We are not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the competitive men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>tality that pervades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>change, and we feel that in the process of this dialogue we can foster a change
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>in the meaning of art.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>which insist that women have not been great composers and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>therefore probably will never become great composers — so
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women researchers have attempted to “find” some great
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women composers to refute this general opinion
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Nochlin goes on to say that although this research is

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>achievements, &quot;such efforts, if written from an uncritically

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The underlying assumption is that women have not

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>us on the defensive. Every time we hear this question, we

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>It is now time that we put research on the history of

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>A feminist analysis of history begins with the recognition

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>social ideas, which is often based on prescriptive literature.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The fourth category, which the authors of this article believe

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>not exerted influence in these areas, the contributions made
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>by women composers and performers would hardly have
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>been possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We are also discovering that a history of women super

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>history which insists that significant contributions are only
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>made by superwomen who mystically and without pain or

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>offering women an impossible role model. Our history of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women in music must offer strength and confidence for
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>women today by establishing the specifics of how these
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>’great&quot; women of music managed their lives, how they
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lived and how they felt about their lives—to demystify
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>genius.&quot; In addition, we need to acknowledge that music
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>history was made by a large group ot musical citizens, who
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>contributed in various ways to musical life, and many of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>these musical citizens were women.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>The research methodology developed by scholars in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>volved with women’s history must in the long run affect

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>will compel the discipline to reconsider prevalent attitudes
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and ideas about what constitutes &quot;greatness&quot; in music. Ulti
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mately we will be forging a new history of music— a history
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>that includes women not in footnotes, supplementary chap
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ters, or special indexes, but as an integral part of the telling
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of history. Music can no longer be presented as the history
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of great men musicians.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>We are learning that the writing of women into history
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>necessarily involves redefining and enlarging traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>notions of historical significance, to encompass personal,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>subjective experience as well as public and political activi
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ties. It is not too much to suggest that, however hesitant the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>actual beginnings, such a methodology implies not only a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>new history of women but also a new history.14
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>It is a considerable task: to develop a feminist perspec

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>music scholarship; to make the history useful in the struggle
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>of contemporary women musicians to end the discrimina
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>tion against them; and, in the process, to forge a new vision
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_9_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of history, a social history that tells the stories of women

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>control the working of the Holy Spirit, and if a woman should
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>receive a charism, as I did, and if it is confirmed by the hier
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>archy of the Church, as mine was, then we can be absolutely

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>What is your particular gift, and how was it confirmed?
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Stly charism is the gift of prophecy, which doesn’t mean
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>simply telling the future; rather, it &quot;consists in knowledge and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>in the manifestation of what is known. The knowledge must
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>be supernatural and infused by God because it concerns
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>things beyond the natural power of created intelligence; and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the knowledge must be manifested either by words or signs,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>because the gift of prophecy is given primarily for the good of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>others, and hence needs to be manifested.&quot;” Now &quot;l had been
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>conscious since my earliest girlhood of a capacity for insight
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>into the most divine, hidden, and wonderful things...butI
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>revealed this to no one except to a few religious people who
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>lived in the same observances as I did, but in the meantime,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>until God willed to manifest these things by his own grace,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>suppressed these things in silence.&quot;” But this incredible light,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>this light that has illuminated all of my visions, came to me
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>most insistently when I was going into my forty-third year. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>a &quot;burning light of great brilliance...entirely flooding my
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>brain, my heart, and my breast, like a flame that does not
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>flicker but burns with glowing warmth, as the sun warms
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>everything that it shines upon.&quot;”° I don’t go into trance or

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The visions are full of color and movement, very specific, and
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>often filled with sound as well. For example, early on an
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>insistent voice told me that I must manifest these visions: tell
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>about them and write them down! Frankly, the whole idea of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>this terrified me, and I don’t mind telling you that this struggle
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>went on for years and years. My refusal to write them down
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was not because of stubbornness, but rather because of fear
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>— fear of what certain men might say about my authority to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>speak, about the authenticity of my visions.&quot; I was finally
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>stricken with a horrible illness that pinned me to my bed for
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>what seemed an interminable agony. This scourging com
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>pelled me to obey the voice of Wisdom, the voice from God.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>This, and the never-failing encouragement of two devoted
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>people, enabled me to begin recording my visions. They are
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>both now dead. One was my beloved Sister in Christ, the nun
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Rikkarda who, over my official written protests, was snatched
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>away from me as abbess of Hildesheim.” The other, who died
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>only recently, was my magister Volmar, who came with me
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>from Disibodenberg, acting as my faithful supporter, confes
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>sor, fellow-collaborator, and sometimes recording secretary
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of these mysteries that are revealed to me.” As 1 began to
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>record the visions, my strength slowly began to return and the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>illness subside. Meanwhile, by a stroke of fortune, Pope
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Eugenius was holding a synod at Trier at the beginning of the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>year 1148. He sent some men to examine me at Disiboden
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>berg, then himself read portions of the Scivias, the record of
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>my visions, which 1 had so far completed. He then confirmed
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>my charism and encouraged me to continue.&quot;

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>about that?
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>It’s utter nonsense. Illness didn’t cause my visions! My illness
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>came from not being able to manifest the visions, from being
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>afraid to give them form and life through my own voice.

				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Now let’s talk about the liturgical songs. How and when did
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>you write them? Also, would you say a few words about the
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>title you’ve given to the whole collection? It’s rather an
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>unusual name for a cycle of liturgical songs. Notker, for
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>example, called his a liber hymnorum (Book of Hymns), but
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you call yours Symphonia armonie celestium revelationum
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>(Symphony of the Harmony of Heavenly Revelations).
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Chere are now about seventy-five songs in the collection,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>plus the text and music for the morality play Ordo
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>virtutum.&quot; Quite a while ago, between 1151 and ’58,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>collected the songs I had already written into a cycle,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>arranged in groups according to their subjects, and gave
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>them that title because, just like the visions, they are re
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>vealed to me and give musical form to divine mysteries.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Music is the highest form of praise for me, and l intend my
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>songs as an earthly counterpart to the music of the spheres,
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>harmonizing the human, physical, and divine worlds into
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>beautiful, ordered sound. I wrote most of the songs for our
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>own use here at our convent, and the largest number are
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>about the Blessed Virgin. There are Antiphons, Respon
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>sories, and Hymns for special Offices, and a few long Se
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>quences for feast-day Masses. A few of them were written
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>in response to requests from elsewhere: old Abbot Kuno
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>asked me to write some songs for their patron saint Disi
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>bode, and l have done a few in honor of local saints at Trier.
				<lb facs='#facs_9_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Recently l had a copy of the collection made in the script

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>lyrical of all your compositions. Could you tell us something
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>about Ursula and your feelings about her?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>J’m sure everyone knows all about Ursula. Her name is on
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>everyone’s lips, convents vie for her relics, and her feast day is
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>celebrated in churches and monasteries throughout the Rhine
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>valley and into the lowlands.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Unfortunately, Lady Abbess, St. Ursula is very little known in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>our day.” In simplest terms, Ursula is attested to in an ancient
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>fourth-century stone inscription in Cologne, and, according to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>legends circulated in the ninth through eleventh centuries,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Ursula was a Christian princess from Briton betrothed by her
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>father to a pagan prince. She herself was dedicated to re
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>maining a virgin, and begged her father for three years’ time
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to go on a pilgrimage with women friends. Her wish was
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>granted, and she set off with her maidens in several galleys on
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a journey which took them up the Rhine, then overland to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Rome to visit the tombs of the apostles. On their return to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Cologne, they were slaughtered by the Huns. Then, early in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the twelfth century, while rebuilding the walls of the town of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Cologne (obviously situated in the midst of an ancient Roman
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>cemetery), huge numbers of bones were discovered. They
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>were believed to be the bones of Ursula and her martyred
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>companions, whose number (due to a simple scribal mistake)
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>had now grown from eleven to eleven thousand. These things
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>were confirmed and elaborated by visions of Elizabeth of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Schöneau, a correspondent of yours, Lady Abbess, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>popular response and revival of feeling about this woman
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>throughout the Rhine valley and into the low countries was
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>overwhelming. That’s the basic legend, isn’t it? And you
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>wrote songs in order to create the Office on her feast day?20
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Well, I would hardly call it a legend! The source for Ursula’s
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>life is a passio, a passion, which is just what it says. She
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pledged herself in the Christian faith to a life of chastity, to a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>divine marriage of the soul, which is not better than, but dif
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ferent from, a physical marriage. She stood her ground
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>through martyrdom, much to the surprise of those who didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>choose to take her seriously. Her participation in this event
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>has ramifications for all of us and carries salvation history fur
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ther into the fullness of time.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>You seem to be saying something about the role ot women in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>that history. Thirteen of your songs are about Ursula; fifteen,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>about the Blessed Virgin, and these in the strongest and most
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>passionate language. The Virgin is a cosmic figure; she is &quot;re
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>membering” the body of Christ.” In another of your songs,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the virgins are &quot;building in the dawn&quot;; they are identified with
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Paradise; they are rebuilding the new Jerusalem.22 Could you
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>be more specific and less mystical about the role of women
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in these songs?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Jwould be loathe to say any more than l have already stated
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>in the songs. In fact, the songs speak for themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Well then, perhaps we could hear a few of the songs for
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Ursula— an Antiphon and a Responsory? Your Antiphons are
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>straightforward structurally. Each consists of one line which
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>gets attached to the appropriate Psalm or New Testament
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Canticle to place it — in this case in the Feast of St. Ursula —at
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>whatever Office you are doing. The Responsories are also tra
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>ditional in form, with a recurrent repetenda sung by the choir
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>and the verses sung by a cantrix. The whole piece is sung as a

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>If we turn to the Sequences, yours are formally very different
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>from those &quot;regular Sequences” of the twelfth century, such
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>as the hundreds that came from the Victorine School. Those
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>have end rhyme, often double rhyme, consistent binary
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>meter, and a very strict pattern for versification. Musically,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>those &quot;regular Sequences” have the same melody for each
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>pair of strophes, so both textually and musically they look
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>like this: AA, BB, CC, DD, and so on. You usually hold on to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the concept of parallel pairs of strophes, but in a much looser
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>way.25 Strophe A, becomes a kind of elaboration on or varia
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>tion of Strophe A, both musically and textually. The verse of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the text is what we would now call &quot;free verse&quot;; that is, it fol
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>lows no formal pattern of versification, but instead hangs to
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>gether through its syntax and through an elaboration of sym
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>bols and images that interconnect organically from begin
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ning to end. Two of your Sequences even abandon all paral
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>lelism and become totally without repetition. The Ursula

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>J’m not sure I follow all of that, but it did turn out to be quite
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>rhapsodic, starting as it does with the sensual language of the

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>And the men said, “The innocence of this ignorant girl!
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>She doesn’t know what she’s talking about!&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>And they began to make fun of her

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>How defiance of the world is like the mountain of Bethel.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>They even identified that sweetest fragrance of incense

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the music itself. I have read that your music is not &quot;pure
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>chant” (whatever that is): that you use folk-like elements and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>mix the authentic and plagal forms of modes indiscriminately
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>within the same piece. I have also read that it is diatonic
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>rather than modal, that it has too many leaps and too wide a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>range.2° I find many of these characteristics to be consistent
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>with regular Frankish practice in melody-writing, as opposed
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>to the chant melodies that originated in Rome; nevertheless,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>your music is more dramatic, more personal, and much more
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lyrical than that found in the Gregorian repertory. Would you
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>care to comment on that?
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The songs lie in a range congenial to women’s voices which, of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>course, differentiates it from most of the standard chant rep
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ertory, Gregorian or Frankish. The use of the leap of the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ascending fifth is very common in our part of the world— very
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>expressive and consonant. As for the rest, my songs are given
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>to me. I am merely a mouthpiece, a vessel, the trumpet of the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Lord. The songs are what I hear. Often texts come directly in a
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>vision from the heavenly Voice, the Wisdom of God. Some of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the melodies are perhaps new and different from what people
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>are used to, but they are also given. Music is a connection

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>express in song. It is our connection with life before the Fall. It

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>collective world), integration of self and the movement

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>What does music have to do with making oneself whole?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Music and dance (sound and motion) have always been
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the sacred tools by which people have established spiritual
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>union with what is unknown and invisible. The first dancing,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>imagine, was movement which surrendered conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>intention to felt rhythms, the larger rhythms which we are all
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>part of. The first music, limagine, was the voices of women
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>incantations for the birth and nurturing of new life, for death
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and mourning, and rebirth.&apos; Early sounds and movement
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>gave form to a cycle of birth, death and rebirth-human
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>form expressing felt life rhythms connecting the world
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>around and within us. The early myths rose from this collec

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>From these prehistorical, prepatriarchal beginnings,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>music has continued to be the tool for making connections,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>both inwardly and out into the world. As male domination

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Jean Mass, a music therapist working with the Lighthouse in

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Therapy Training Program at Turtle Bay Music School, says
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>music is a basic need and doubts anything equals its power
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to act upon the human organism. But she does not know
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>how music acts in this therapeutic way. She does believe it
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>offers alternatives, or access to hidden resources—the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>places we have not yet touched. For example, most brain
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>damage she encounters is in the left hemisphere, where
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>clients are language-impaired. However, if they can learn
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>music, by a technique called melodic intonation, language
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>can be recovered from the left hemisphere and housed in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the right. By singing a simple chant while at the same time
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>rhythmically touching the body of the client (sound and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>motion) and showing a picture of the desired activity (e.g.,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>eating, going to the bathroom, brushing teeth), the client
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>begins to sing the words back and eventually makes the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>necessary nervous system connections between the word
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and its lost meaning. Another example is a 37-year-old girl
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>with a history of brain seizures who had no concept of lan
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>guage. She couldn’t even coordinate her brain wave signals
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>well enough to walk. Yet as Mass sang directions to her, she
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>learned to respond, and loved the drum so much she
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>learned to walk to get it.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Mass refuses to use the word “patient.&quot; She says she
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>&quot;cures&quot; nothing; she is a teacher who demonstrates ways for
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>her clients to explore themselves. Interestingly, no woman

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>people can learn to heal themselves. That we have the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>power within us to heal ourselves is a wonderful and radical
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>concept. With regard to the politics of our lives, the notion

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>consciousness. Annea Lockwood, also a composer and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>teacher, feels we are returning to something ancient and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>lost until now by creating music which brings attention to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>our oneness or integration with the universe. One of her

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>piece where people lie on the earth and allow themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to sense the earth’s vibrations, letting those vibrations come
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>out through their voices without controlling the voice. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>designed, she says, to feel oneself as part of the earth and as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>one with the universe. She began exploring environmental
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sound out of a desire to stop manipulating sound and to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>come to know the vitality in everything, no matter how
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>inanimate—to learn how marvelous the naked and unviolated
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>thing itself can be: the sound of glass, rock, earth: human life.

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>rather than manipulating sound in a goal-oriented way, they

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tarily, creating sound from an entirely different mode. Even

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>intention was to do what seemed beneficial, not only the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>sound itself, but also the way people related during the

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Ruth Anderson used music to find her way back to

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>recover. She began exploring inner sound in meditation and,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>after a long period of being unable to compose, began
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>writing music again. Her first piece was a meditation which
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>she called Points,? an electronic mantra-like work using only
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>sine tones (theoretically pure sounds having no overtones,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>similar to the sound of a wet glass being rubbed around its
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>rim). Her intention was to create something only for herself,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>organized on breathing rhythms; something having as little
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>color as possible, that did nothing, simply mantra.? When

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>working all day, felt rested and energized by the music.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>When this happened again and again, she began realizing
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>that the sine tones themselves acted like sonic acupressure.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>From there she began exploring music and healing with
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>three other women (another composer, a psychic healer,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>and a medium who is also a singer), and became interested
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>in the human voice as well as an electronic medium.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>My own experience during the many phases of change
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was great confusion. Often in the process of isolating
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>fragmented aspects, reintegrating and healing, I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>nothing of my relationship to the world vibrating outside my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>skin. During the spring two years ago, some days the best
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>could do was to sit on a park bench knowing for certain only
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the heat of the sun and my breathing. There were times
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>when I picked up my guitar and played without knowing, on
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>some level, what the guitar was. Yet out of some uncon
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>scious and not understood need, I played and sang and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>improvised sounds. This was soothing and strengthening.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Then I began singing long tones (toning) in a meditation,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>feeling different sounds resonating different parts of my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>body. It was in this process, combined with lessons in move
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ment, that l began to soften tight, defensive muscle tissue (a
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>body organized around fighting), open blocked areas, and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>discover the inner workings of what is truly my own miracu
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>lous being.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Each time a blocked area of my body was opened up,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>unfinished emotional energy was discharged (muscle tissue
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and the nervous system hold the fears we have been unable
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to resolve). And my relationship to the world changed
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>because I was exposing a new area to sensation and allow
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ing myself to feel that sensation. Because I was receiving
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>new sensations (new messages from newly opened nerve
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>paths), I experienced confusion. My form of the world had
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>been changed—the grid used to organize information (which
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>is myself-the sum of all my cells: my vision, world-view)
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>expanded and a healing process had to take place before !
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>could interpret messages clearly again.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Confusion is generally manifest in an &quot;uhmm&quot; sound (like
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>&quot;uhmm, I don’t know&quot;—the inability to make connection, the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>loss of words). Emotionally, I experienced this confusion as
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>feeling disconnected, seeing what was outside of me as
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>though I were underwater. When I changed the &quot;uhmm
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sound into a long tone which resonated the area being
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>opened, I felt relief and the experience became pleasant.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>The sensation was that the rawness (the discomfort) was
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>being soothed and healed. When I asked Pauline Oliveros
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>about this process, she speculated that the long tones gave
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the freshly opened tissue something to organize around,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>that I gave attention to the tissue in such a way as to bypass
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>or go under the emotional confusion and allow relaxation
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and healing.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Not only is musiclsound enormously valuable in explor
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ing our inner selves, it is wonderful for exploring beyond our
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>boundaries of what we kow of living together. Music, par
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ticularly vocal music, allows us to transcend our existing
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>notions of human relationships and affords a way of learning
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>to trust our intuitive, rhythmic sense of what we are for one
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>another. For instance, in music therapy situations, patients
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>often have great difficulty relating to others, and choral
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>singing is a technique used to facilitate communication. In a
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>singing group, the participant is able to find a closeness with
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>out feeling threatened because the sound and the sense of
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>making sounds with others transcend verbal identities/
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>boundaries. The vibration and resonance of sound and rhythm
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>allow communion often initially impossible at a verbal level.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Sound and rhythm coming before the word.

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and its healing power. The concerts consist of original and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>traditional music, songs, and some improvisation. The work
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>shops are wholly improvisational and consist of group exer
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cises (or events). Below are two examples:
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>We stood in a circle. Each person took her or his turn standing
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in the center. Each thought of one word and one color. The
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>group held hands and in unison chanted the name of the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>person in the center three times while raising their arms up
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ward. The sensation was that the sound was being directed
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>from the group to the center person’s toes upward through
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the top of the head.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>As l stood in the center Iliterally felt sensation rise through
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>me as the group’s tone rose. And the feeling was one of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>safety and well-being, of connectedness.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>We sat in a circle. A poem was given (a Navajo chant in this
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>instance) and we each were to sing a line or two of the poem
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>or make any sound we wished. After the first sounds were
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>given anyone in the group could add to the sound or impro
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>vise. As the poem progressed, the voices of the group
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>gathered color and texture and dramatically moved in great
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>waves. When it had finished, by collective consensus, we all
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>felt dramatically alive.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>These exercises are not unlike the Sonic Meditations of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Pauline Oliveros, in that they create an environment where
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>communal awareness can be experienced at a deep, rhyth
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mic level. For example, one meditation just recently done at
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>an avant-garde music festival in New York was about tuning.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>The instructions to the participants were twofold: (1) sing
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>only long tones, one per breath, making your tone a contri
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>bution; and (2) then tune to someone else’s tone and alter
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>nate between the two tasks. The instruction to the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>composer was to close her eyes and let herself be aware of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>all the sounds and not to lose her concentration. After 15
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>minutes, the piece ended together-group consensus. After
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>this particular performance, a woman told Oliveros she had
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>had a backache and found it gone after the piece (not an

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_14_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>placed in front of me. Thus a definition of music was

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ments of the most essential events in our lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>My songs for the street plays and ritual dramas
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>became material for giving myself and others poignant

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the screams, the cries that were being released from my
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>body. The words took longer to find. Emotions moved
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>into sounds, into their word meanings, with the slow
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>motion of clouds, the slow evolving of seed to plant to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>bud to flower I had witnessed in my mother’s garden. The
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>notes I played on my instruments moved between keys
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>to the places where the exact intonation of crying, talk
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ing, chanting, existed. I was finding my language. I could
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>release the pain in my body and embrace the natural
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>rhythms of my sense organs. The sorrow and pain from
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>inadequate direction would take a long time coming out.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would begin to stand for hours, weeks, years in front of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>my marimba, with the hard rosewood keys from Africa
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and the resonating aluminum pipes from Detroit, the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>same marimba I shared with my twin sister when we
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>were growing up. On this instrument I remember and re

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tional pieces. Playing my guitar or drum, I music myself
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>into a space I can express myself in.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>In my songs I sing out the first song woman made, the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>song of her giving birth, the song of her claiming herself
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>as the creator of all life, the song of her refusal to be
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>murdered, the song of her awakening. The song of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>woman is not separate from the breath and body of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>woman. Woman’s song is the song of the earth, of al
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>nature refusing to be destroyed. As I remember how
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>found my music in me, I think of all the women I know
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>struggling like myself to find their own music— all of us

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>began by realizing the incredible mass of energy
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with which I was dealing. I was still in my last year of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>high school, and my prime link with music at the time
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>was my piano studies. Suddenly I realized the great im
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pact of music and how it had been subtly but quite
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>firmly weaving itself into my person. Up until then I had
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>not planned on music as a career, so it was a surprise
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>even to me when I decided to become a music major
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The more music touched me, the more I wanted, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>more I learned, the more I wanted to know. Everything
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>about it was exciting.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>1was innocently planning to get a degree and certifi
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>cation as a music teacher when I was blessed with a new
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>professor, a composer named Ruth Anderson. With mini
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>mal verbiage, she helped me to open up one channel
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>after another of discovery and exploration. In her classes
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>music was listening, doing, caring, and paying attention
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>It was her crisp phrase, “Write, don’t think,” that led me
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>into composition. I was amazed that it hadn’t occurred
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to me before to write my own music. The prospect of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>composing was intriguing. I couldn’t wait to get at it.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>wrote a one-page piaño piece during sophomore inter
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>cession. That was it. That was all I needed. I knew
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>would continue
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>began my investigation into contemporary work
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and discovered electronic music, an area of which I was
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>totally ignorant. I hadn’t even known of its existence. It
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>appealed to my exploratory nature. I knew I had found a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>treasure. I began experimenting with tape recorders,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>recording everything within ears’ reach. It was a great ear
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>opener; my life became increasingly exciting with vibrant
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>sound. Every sound became important to me—the
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sounds of pieces of wood, stones, sand, buttons, seeds,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>pine cones, glass, metal, preparing and eating food,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>water, body movements, singing and speaking, bells such
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>as Tibetan Ting Cha and Russian sleigh bells, baby rat
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tles, etc
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>In graduate school I began to compose in an elec
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>tronic music studio and became particularly interested
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>in the psycho-acoustic aspect of sound. I noticed that if
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a sound is constant it is often temporarily “turned off
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>by the listener. At some later point, however, the listener
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>will remember having heard and physically experienced
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>that particular sound over that whole period of time.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Even though the listener&apos;s attention turns to other
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>sounds in the composition, those &quot;turned off” sounds are
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>heard on another perceptual level.

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>demonstrate an extended use of the instrument, such as

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sion of the sound spectrum available to us. Basically
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>consider these sounds not to be new or invented sounds
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>but sounds we don’t usually pay attention to. The recog
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>nition of these sounds brings the life force of creativity
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to them.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>With the realization that music is not “just ears,”
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>began to explore the use of other media with music as
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>well as the interlocking of our perceptual experiences.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>My interest was not in placing media side by side, not
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>even to complement one another, but rather in how one
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>medium could grow out of and perhaps prosper from its
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>direct relationship to another. A good example is the great
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>visual impact of musical scores. I like to make scores
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that are sculptural, operated by electricity. That is, they
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>move and light up. In “Turnative,” a piece for prepared
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>piano and electronic sounds, the notation is written on a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>clear Plexiglas disc. Behind it is a second, translucent
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>disc with outlines of triangles in red, blue, and yellow.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This second disc indicates tempi. All other necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>notation is contained on the first disc. The notation is
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>written in segments which are continuously linked to one
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>another throughout the disc. The performer chooses a
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>segment that is right-side-up and simply follows through
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to the neighboring linked segments. These discs are
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>mounted on a motor and stand. The score rotates at one
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>third revolution per minute. Thus the performer needs to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>focus only on one area and the notation will continually
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>change. The score is lighted so that no other light is
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>needed. Light from the score falls on the performer&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>face and hands.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>In the past few years I have become involved with
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the study of memory in relation to our total structure
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and, most recently, with aspects of sillence and the total

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and mixed voices, I explore the hearing of sound, its in
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ternalization, and then its recall into the conscious state.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>It is a common hearing experience to all of us, but one of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>which we remain relatively ignorant because of its rapid
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>assimilation into the unconscious. A cross-section of our
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>perceptual levels reveals multiple layers of coexistence
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>which endlessly emerge and retreat with incredible simul

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>texture of the sound structure. The large-group instru

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ists’ space. They will change location ever so slightly at

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the state of sound at all times. As the sounds become
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>denser in texture and occur at more frequent intervals,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the perfórmers will be physically closer to each other and

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>art. The ideas that make up an aesthetic come from experi
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ence. And these ideas are brought to bear, in a critical man

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>marriage, religion, government, education—and believed

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to experience and then depart from what is generally
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>accepted.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>History gives us a long list of men who have embodied

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>be pretty, alluring, ornamental. And so, in line with these ex

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Women are expected to defer power to men, and so they have
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>played a &quot;behind-the-scenes” role in art. Even when women
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>have made important contributions, credit has not been

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>To a large extent, we have hardly been permitted to ex

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>a culture shaped for the most part by men. Our conceptions
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of beauty and expression are transmitted through sources
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>influenced for the most part by men. We are left with a male

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>speaks to the supression of our creativity. Ideally, male and

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the integration of the female and male perspectives. How
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ever, this integration is not yet in sight.

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of women in blues and jazz. Because our oppression is part
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of our history, it is ultimately part of our aesthetics and our

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and terror. The audience is engulfed in an unrelenting wave
				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of sound which seems to sound the bottom of women&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>woman’s role in music history is manifold: to discover what

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>which women who did express themselves musically were
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>exceptions in a predominantly male world, adopting, even

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>&quot;feminine aesthetic&quot;:Is it a useful concept as we attempt to
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>rewrite women’s history? Can it be applied to a discussion of
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>music as it has been to that of the other artists?

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>been musically active. Literature and paintings abound with
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>examples of the female musician playing her harpsicord or
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>her piano, singing lullabies or folk songs, accompanying

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>since most women, particularly among the leisured classes,
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>were taught to play and sing, most of the names associated
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>with &quot;serious” music belong to men. There seem to be at
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>least two ways to approach this puzzle.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>One is to insist that there were women making music fit
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>to be taken seriously, that is, composing as well as per
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>forming, but that, given the role of women in society, they
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>did not have access to the means of recognition and distri
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>bution that were available to their brothers and fathers.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Another is that, given woman’s traditional nurturing and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>decorative roles in society and particularly in the family, she
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>had few opportunities to do other than interpret men’s com

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>played, as it were, second fiddle.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Any attempt to reclaim the history of women’s music
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>has to begin from the assumption that both of these are
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>valid. As this issue of Heresies demonstrates, there is a his
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>tory, smudged, distorted, and partially lost though it be. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>important that we work to make it as complete and coher
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>ent as possible. It is also true that, given woman’s narrow
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>position in society, her musical capacities have been domes
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ticized and channeled. Just as men have made “art&quot; and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>women &quot;craft,&quot; just as men have been &quot;chefs&quot; and women
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>&quot;cooks, so too, within music, the distinction has flourished.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Once this is recognized, our next step is to be critical of the
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>traditions we have inherited, acknowledging that the con

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>suggested a feminine aesthetic. This is what I found:
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Women here are interested less in being composers than
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>in being people who LIVE—and compose and write and
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>design, etc. Their art becomes not less important, but freer
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to take its own form and to be integrated into their lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>They see composing as a means of bringing them closer
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to other people, rather than as a means to distinguish them

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Compositions often involve the other arts in addition to

				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>most potent means to express an idea. It indicates not only a
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>willingness to take risks, but an enthusiasm about art that
				<lb facs='#facs_24_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>encourages anyone to participate.

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>which it was received. The conflict between her role as a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>woman and her role as composer was resolved through the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>development’of sexual aesthetics, which analyzed music as a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>combination of feminine and masculine traits; therefore
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>music written by women should and did express &quot;femininity.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>As descriptive metaphors, the terms &quot;feminine” and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&quot;masculine” were not alien to 19th-century music criticism.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Schumann, for example, described a pair of Schubert trios
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in just such terms; Opus 99 was “more passive, lyric and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>feminine, while Opus 100 was &quot;active, masculine and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>dramatic.&quot; Furthermore, as metaphors used to describe the

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>need to confine the woman composer. Just as Schubert
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>could write masculine or feminine music, so could she....
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>However, because of the climate of prejudice against

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>cism degenerated into the language of sexual aesthetics, in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>which the potentialities of the individual female composer
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>were defined through the application of sexual stereotypes.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Femininity in music was comprised of delicacy, grace,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>refinement, and sensitivity. It was defined as the &quot;eternal
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>feminine” or the ewige weibliche, descending from Goethe&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>concept of womanhood. Because of the great vogue of Ger
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>man music in the late 19th century, especially Wagnerian
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>opera, the German term for the feminine ideal was fre
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>quently used by American critics. Wagnerian heroines,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>moreover, were the prototype of the &quot;eternal feminine” in
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>their fathomless capacity for self-abnegation, while Wagner
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and Beethoven were the prototypical &quot;masculine” compos
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ers. Female instrumentalists were advised to limit their
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>repertory to Chopin and Mendelssohn, less alien in feeling.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>By 1900 the aesthetics of the “eternal feminine” in music
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>had been extended to include form and style as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>emotive content. Vocal music was the essence of ewige
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>weibliche because it &quot;appeals more directly to the heart&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>(T.L. Krebs). Since harmony and counterpoint were &quot;logical,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>they were alien subjects. Instead of musical intellect, a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>woman was supposed to rely on her &quot;imagination,” from
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>which &quot;beautiful melodies could flow.&quot; The “higher class of

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>songs. But she was the only woman to write symphonic and
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>chamber music of signiticant stature.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The première of the Gaelic Symphony on October 30,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>1896, was a controversial event. As an erstwhile member of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the Boston group of composers, Beach emulated their
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>eclectic style, assimilating the harmonic vocabulary of
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Brahms and Wagner as well as the current fashion for folk
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tunes into her long, rather high-flown work.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Its critical reception is a perfect example of the double
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>standard by which the music of women composers was
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>judged. No matter what the merits of the piece, both its vir
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tues and its faults were alleged illustrations of the eternal
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>feminine. While the Women&apos;s Journal chronicled the event
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>on November 6 as one that gave them &quot;no slight satisfaction
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and pride, other critics were not quite so generous. The
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Boston Tribune critic Philip Hale, for example, attempted to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>avoid condescension, but still related the defects of the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>orchestration to her sex: “Occasionally she is noisy rather
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>than sonorous, Here she is eminently feminine. A woman
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>who writes for orchestra thinks &apos;l must be virile at any
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>cost.... The only trace of woman I find in this symphony is
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>this boisterousness.&quot; What Hale meant by virility was exces
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sively heavy orchestration. The implication is that because
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of prejudice against women composers, Beach overcom
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pensated by overwriting.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The moral was obvious. Women who sought after virility
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>by writing in the higher forms defeated themselves....
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The &quot;eternal feminine” aesthetic therefore provided a
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>referential vocabulary in which the music of female com
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>posers could be judged by a double standard that placed
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>them in a double bind. When they composed in the smaller
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>feminine” forms such as songs and piano pieces, they were
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>thereby demonstrating their sexually derived inadequacies
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to think in the larger abstract forms. If, on the other hand,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>they attempted these forms, they were betraying their
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>sexual identities by writing “man-tone” music.
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Sexual aesthetics therefore functioned as a way to
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>assign female composers a peripheral place within compo
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>sition. It qualified the effect that the emergence of the

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>civilized world, Grażyna married Andrzej Biernacki, a

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her sister Wanda (who had been seriously wounded in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>one of the many bombings). In spite of these responsi

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of war that she experienced. Once, in the midst of a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>bombing raid, she had to leave her suitcase filled with
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>compositions in her home, but miraculously hers was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>one of the few hoúses in the area that survived the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>attack. Her humanistic qualities shone during these
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>years. Her home was often a refuge for the hungry and a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sanctuary for the continuation of Polish culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Concerts to raise money for a general relief fund were
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>given in secrecy. Yet, during this time, she quietly and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>with great personal fortitude found time to compose her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Sonata for Solo Violin, 1 Symphony, II String Quartet,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Suite for Two Violins, and the Overture for Orchestra.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>With the August 1944 uprising in Warsaw, her family was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>forced to leave and live out the remainder of the war in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>various towns outside the capital.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>In the years immediately following the war, her
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>music began to develop its own distinctive style. Pre
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>viously, as a student at the Warsaw Conservatory, she
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>had been influenced (as were so many others of the time)
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>by the brilliance of Karol Szymanowski. Her studies in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Paris helped to free her from this influence. Applying the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>knowledge of classical forms with a contemporary ap
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>proach, her compositions evolved into the neoclassical
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>form, so popular at the time. This neoclassical style cul
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>minated in her String Concerto (also referred to as the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Concerto for String Orchestra) of 1948. In this work an

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>exciting musical expressions. The immediate popularity
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>of this composition confirmed her worth as a composer,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and she took her place among the best of the contem
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>porary composers. It had its American première in 1952
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., to enthusiastic
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>reviews.

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>position or prize, her passion for composing continued,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>with the result that her music was in a constant state of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>evolution. The 1950s saw the abandonment of the neo
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>classical style and the creation of new and imaginative
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>works. In 1953 Bacewicz premièred her II Sonata for
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Piano. The piece is filled with technical difficulties, not
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>for their own sake but for the essential execution of the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>original concept. Each of the three movements possesses
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>exciting, passionate rhythms that build to climaxes and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>then ebb into contemplative moods. Her musical growth
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>continued throughout the 1950s, which saw the comple
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>tion of her IV and V String Quartets, 1 Piano Quintet, two
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>symphonies, and the V Sonata for Violin and Piano,

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In 1956 the Polish working class rioted against the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Russian regime of political terror and against the low
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>standard of living. This protest resulted in a more liberal
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Polish Communist Party rule that, though it has supported
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Russia politically, has allowed more religious and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cultural freedom. The new freedom given music was
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>symbolized by the first Warsaw Autumn Festival held in
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the fall of 1956. Each year since then these festivals have
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>provided a platform for contemporary music. At the fes
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tival in 1959 Music for Strings, Trumpets and Percussion,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in which her style changes subtly, was premièred. The
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>vigorous rhythms and sharply contrasted themes con
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tained in her earlier works are evident, but here these are
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>combined with a new boldness and dynamism. For this
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>composition Bacewicz received the first prize from the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>composers&apos; tribunal of UNESCO, selected from over
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>sixty orchestral entries. It is this work that points to the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>direction she was to take in the succeeding decade.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Stimulated by contemporary ideas (such as those of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>her countrymen Serocki, Baird, and Penderecki), she next
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>began to experiment with serial techniques. The VI String
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Quartet of 1959 was the result. Though she did not con
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tinue in a direction of strict dodecaphony, her experi
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ments aided the growth of her compositional abilities.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>She never used electronics in her music, but she sup
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ported their use by others. All new musical idioms were
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>filtered through her and served to expand the horizons of
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>her individuality.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Thus Pensieri Notturni (1961) explores the problems

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tuosities. This forceful and at times ethereal work has
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>been performed by several American orchestras in recent
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>years. Having written for the cello (in the concertos of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>1951 and 1963), Bacewicz turned her attention to the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>viola, and in 1968 the Viola Concerto was written and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>dedicated to one of Poland’s outstanding soloists, Stefan
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Kamaza. In the same year she wrote the short, but mem
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>orable, Esquisse pour Orgue.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Bacewicz not only wrote for a wide variety and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>combination of instruments, but she also wrote for the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>stage. The Warsaw radio presented her comic opera The
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Adventures of King Arthur in 1959. Her ballet A Peasant
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Becomes King was written in 1953. A humorous ballet,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Esic in Ostende, was written in 1964. Then she undertook
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to write the music for Desire, a ballet based on Picasso&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>play Desire Caught by the Tail, which would prove to be
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>her last work. She approached this task with the same
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>philosophy she applied to all of her music. She did not
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>confine herself solely to the written word. Musical auton
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>omy was the key, and as she had said previously about
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>music in general, she now said about the ballet in partic

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>expresses itselt and its own emotion.&quot;? Her work on the

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>we will never know. She died unexpectedly in January
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>1969. Though the ballet was completed according to

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Unfortunately, most of us have overlooked the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>that a sizable body of concert music has been and is
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>being created by Black composers. The obscurity of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Black composers is the result of the social convention
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>brought about by years of tradition. According to Alex
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Bontemps, “this nation, 200 years after its birth, still har
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bors old and degenerate racial attitudes, attitudes that
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>have persisted... despite the contributions in the arts
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from Black Americans” (Ebony, 30:115)
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>It is a mistake to assume that, satisfied with their con

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to achieve in other realms of art. The late Charles Cameron
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>White, Black composer and past president of the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>National Association of Negro Musicians, wrote: “The
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sum of accomplishments is but an imperfect indication
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of what the black race is capable of in America” (Etude
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>42:305-306). The Black musician, however fortunate she
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>or he may be, does have a much harder struggle than the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>white musician. By demonstrating the genuine value of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>much music written by Black composers, perhaps we
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>can solve the problem of the Black community’s uncon

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>music. True, it is difficult enough for white classical com
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>posers to get a hearing, but for Black composers it be
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>comes almost impossible. T.]. Anderson, a contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Black composer, says: “As far as whites go, blacks are
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>good jazz musicians, but the classical tradition is reserved
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>for whites” (Newsweek, 83:82)— and one might add &quot;for
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>men.&quot; This may be one reason the Fifth Annual Work-

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Black women in music. The workshop, held in Atlanta in

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Rock, Arkansas, on April 9, 1888. She graduated from the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>New England Conservatory of Music in 1906, where she
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>studied with George W. Chadwick and Frederick S. Con
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>verse. She continued her studies in Chicago, and settled
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>there permanently in 1927 after marrying Thomas
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Price, a lawyer, in 1912. Her studies included work at the

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Chicago. It was also in Chicago that Price became the

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>As a composer, Price’s compositions involve many
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>different media. Though she is probably best remembered

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Negro and His Music) says Price was one of the outstand

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>wonderful and also &quot;blah.&quot; I have a tendency to ride myself

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to not be consistent — and to mother myself. And so the last six

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>unidiomatic writing for piano. I have just recently begun to

				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>capable of doing. I have been studying Bartok’s String Quartets
				<lb facs='#facs_36_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>for the first time in my life (pause for post-orgasmic sigh!) and

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>techniques. I was able to see that my goal was not to use these
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>techniques simply to be associated with 20th-century music,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>but rather to absorb (through my pores, if possible) these modes
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of communicating, so that I can then pull from me what I want
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to say. The vocabulary will simply facilitate my writing music

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>When I first considered myself to be a composer (at
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>age 10), music seemed to be primarily about writing
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>down inspirations — in what I was told was án infinitely
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>repeatable form. By 15, I had discovered serialism (a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>much more left-brain way of arriving at a composition)
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Although I no longer work with serialist methods, I still
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>use their relatives — puzzles and numbers and repeating
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>codes or games. In college I fell in love with the ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and music of John Cage, and soon after that, with the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>music and personal image of Pauline Oliveros. These
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>two composers have been co-rulers in my aesthetic life
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>up until very recently, and as a result (or was it a simul
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>taneity?) my work opened up and became a more experi
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>mental acoustic and electronic form of music. It has
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>been reviewed as being a &quot;new music of a decidedly non
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>academic experimental, post-Cagian sort.&quot; (John Rock
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>well, New York Times, Dec. 7, 1975, p. 80)
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Now what does that mean, and why did I choose to
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>make this kind of music instead of folk-rock or new wave
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>or avant-garde jazz? I know that—given my life expe

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>or soul l have —this is what I have come up with. I think
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that when composers are developing a style, they don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>consciously decide what kind of music they are going
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to write. They simply make the music, and whateve
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>comes out is theirs. By the time I got around to having
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>friends who were in rock bands, for example, I had devel
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>oped a more abstract aesthetic. I tried to play in a band
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and even wrote a few songs in that direction, but it didn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>feel like the right path for me
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>About seven years ago at Mills College in California, a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>group of women musicians organized Hysteresis. We per
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>formed each other’s music and shared our electronic
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>equipment with each other. We made an impact on the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>community, but the real explosion took place inside of
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>us. In this group I found support and cooperation and a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>new sense of self-respect, belonging, and direction. The
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>creation of this union had a strong effect on my musica
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ideas, as well. The mystical-political concept that 4 is the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>most feminine of the feminine numbers (a double duple)
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>influenced the number of players in my ensemble, Peachy
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Keen-o. Numerological methods of arriving at decisions led
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>me to decide which instruments to use in Tulip Clause: only
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the ones whose names added up to feminine, that is,
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>even numbers. Since letters could be transformed into
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>numbers, I realized that words could become pitches. So
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Idecoded a portion of Certrude Stein’s Q.E.D to arrive at
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>pitches for the two violins and voice, which created the
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>feeling of the three characters involved in her text. Since
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Ms. Stein chose to veil her true meaning, I put part of a
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>text by Kathy Acker (whose meaning was similar but
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>overt) underneath the acoustic material. I felt a great

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>forced me to think smaller, tighter, lighter, cheaper, and in a

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>without the splices. The genre uses a text as the sounding
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>material of the music, and because of that, anyone who

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Ruth Crawford was born in East Liverpool, Ohio, in 1901.
				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Her father was a Methodist minister; her mother, the daughter

				<lb facs='#facs_40_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>vatory in Chicago with just enough money saved for a year

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>people interested in new musie. In this way, Crawford became

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Rudhyar became an earhe influence and Mentor, it was he
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>who introduced Crawford to the works and philosophy of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Alexander Scriabin. (Later, in 1929 he recommended

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Crawford for the Guggenheim grant.5) Gradually the young
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>composer was also exposed to works as diverse as those of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Stravinsky, Milhaud and Vaughan Williams. Through art critic
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Alfred Frankenstein, another Herz regular, Crawford met Carl
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Sandbürg. Sandburg became a lifelong friend, and Crawford
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>used his poems almost exclusively in her vocal works. She
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>even contributed some of the piano accompaniments to
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Sandburg&apos;s The American Songbag. Thus, her initial interest in
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>folk music dates from her conservatory years, and not simply
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to her later involvement, along with ter husband, in the Com

				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Of eveyone in the tiny Chicago music circle, Henry Cowell
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was to have the greatest impact on Crawford&apos;s life. From about
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>1923 tó 1950, Cowell was a pivotal figure in new music circles.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>He actively promoted performances of avant-garde music and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>assisted young composers: his book New Music Resources
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was a compendium of hypothetical new music techniques
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>which later stimulated composers like Pulitizer Prize winner
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Elliott Carter to experiment with procedures like metrical
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>modulation.6
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Cowell was the first to publish Crawford&apos;s work, choosing
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the last four of her nine Piano Preludes tor inclusion in the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>October 1928 edition of New Music Quarterly. He probably
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>encouraged her to come to New York after completing her
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>studies at the conservatory. Once she arrived in 1929 he
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>arranged for her to spend the winter with Mrs. Blanche
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Walton, a wealthy widow and music patron. Soon Crawford
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>became acquainted with the New York music circle; among
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>others, she met Carl Ruggles, Arturo Toscanini, and Martha
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Graham.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Most important, Cowell persuaded Charles Seeger, his
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>former teacher and a regular visitor at the Walton home, to
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>take Cawford as a pupil. At first, Seeger resisted the idea; he
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>had a low opinion of women composers which he expressed
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>frequently.7 When Cowell showed him several of Crawford&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>compositions he was extremely critical, calling them &quot;undisci
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>plined&quot; and &quot;lacking in form,&quot; although he admitted that she
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>was a good craftswoman, she could put notes together in a
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>way of her own.&quot;8 But Cowell persisted, and finally Seeger
				<lb facs='#facs_42_line_1695843700223_126' n='N040'/>agreed to give Crawford six trial lessons, to be paid for by Mrs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Walton. Charles Seeger remembered the first lesson this way:
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Ruth came with this attitude: &quot;I&apos;m going to show this guy here.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_11_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>You see, she&apos;d been brought up in the sticks of Chicago and
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>wanted to come to New York. She gave up a profitable class of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>piano students to live on nothing but S10.00 a month - that was
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>all she could look forward to in the way of income in New York.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_11_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>But all you had to do was to challenge her and she could make
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_11_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>up her resolve...
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>At the end of the first lesson, Mrs. Walton tapped on the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>door and said that supper was ready. Nothing happened. She
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>knocked a little louder. Still nothing happened. Finally she said
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>plaintively, &quot;Supper’s spoiling.&quot; Well, that was about half an
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>hour overtime, so we broke up.9
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The lessons continued to the satisfaction of both parties
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Charles Seeger and Ruth Crawford had opposite, but compli
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mentary personalities: Seeger son of a wealthy, &quot;very cor
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>rect&quot; New England family, was once described as &quot;five feet of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ice and ten feet of books,&quot;10 while Crawford radiated an extra
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ordinary warmth and interest which put people immediately
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>at ease. Despite their personality differences, teacher and stu
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dent apparently had remarkably similar ideas about what was
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>lacking in the music of their time. They felt that the music on
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the early serialists tended to be too diffuse and incomprehen
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sible in its organization for the intelligent listener to under
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>stand without the use of elaborate theories and detailed pro
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>gram notes.11 Schoenbergs twelve-tone system fascinated
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Crawford but, like Seeger, she found it too rigid in actual
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>practice.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Charles Seeger had, however, developed a procedure
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>called dissonant counterpoint, in which seven or eight pitches
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>or tones are used before the original pitch is repeated. He
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>also felt that the longer a composer could keep a melodic line
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>from coming to a cadence - a feeling of pause or ending - the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>more skill was involved.12 Seeger&apos;s initial work with Crawford
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>focused on having her write single-line melodies &quot;purified&quot; of
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>consonances. Piano Study in Mixed Accents (1929) is a fascinat
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing example of this procedure; it also gives the performer the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>option of using three different dynamic patterns, and its
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>second half is, with mimor variants, a retrograde version of the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>first half.
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Seeger&apos;s theoretical concepts, particularly his dissonant
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>counterpoint, influenced Crawford considerably from 1929 to
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>1932, but she utilized these concepts in her own individua
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>way. Seeger&apos;s skepticism about teaching her quickly dis
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>appeared. Several years later, in his chapter on Crawford for
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>American Composers on Américan Music, he wrote: “One
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>can find only a few men among American composers who are
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>as uncompromising and successfully radical.&quot;13
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Crawford&apos;s favorite instrumental mediurn was the chamber
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ensemble, and her two orchestral scores are for small orches
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tra. Her concern for musical organization is evident even in
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>early compositions like the nine impressionistic, Scriabin
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>influenced Piano Preludes (1924-1928) or the Suite for Small
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Orchestra (1926). These works show important features of her
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>mature music despite their experimental and somewhat de
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>rivative nature. For example, in the first movement of the lat
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ter three rhythmic ostinati (repeated patterns) in the piano,
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>cellos and violins act as a form-building device over which the
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>winds and then the strings play lyrical melodies. Later works
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>similarly use some component of the music vocabulary
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>rhythm, texture, motive, pitch, interval (the distance between
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>softness) as a form-building device, but in a more tight
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>contolled manner. And while the early works are written in a
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>chromatic or atonal idiom characteristic of the Post-Roman
				<lb facs='#facs_42_r_12_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tics, from about 1930 on Crawford placed increasing emphasis

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>combined to hinder her work.

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Beck,a colleague and friend, remembers as a modest apart
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ment-all they could afford at the time.&quot;18 Beck recalls asking
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Crawford why she didn&apos;t move to Chicago where she could
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>get a good-paying teaching job at the American Conservatory.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>&quot;My God, I wouldn’t think of it,&quot; replied Crawford. &quot;I&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>rather starve in New York than go back to Chicago.&quot;19
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>During this period Crawford (she continued to compose
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>under her family name) kept writing music. She completed the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>third of the-above-mentioned songs, and, in 1932, she wrote
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Two Ricercari, songs for voice and piano set to poems by H.T.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Tsiang. The first song, &quot;Sacco, Vanzetti,&quot; dealt with the trial of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>these two Italian-Americans, widely believed to be innocent,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>who were executed for the murder of a guard during a rob
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>bery. The second, &quot;Chinaman, Laundryman,&quot; dealt with the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>exploitation of Chinese immigrants. Crawford used the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Sprechstimme style of vocal delivery and directed that the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>clarity of the words was more important than exact pitch.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>These songs, though less successful musically than other
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>mature works, reflect her concern for minorities and involve
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ment in a group called the Composers Collective, which at
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tempted (generally unsuccesstully) to connect music to the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>economic situation.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Composer Vivian Fine, who studied with Crawford in
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Chicago during the 1920s and subsequently kept in touch with
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>her in New York, describes the changing climate in avant
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>garde music circles during the Depression:
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Life became very tough economically, and you saw widespread
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>misery. The idea was to communicate, to transform society
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>with political and social ideas. In this, there was no room for the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>avant-garde: Ruth&apos;s Two Ricercari, which I heard performed,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>was an attempt to hold onto that, and then she stopped writ
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ing. It wasn&apos;t because of the kids, or anything like that.20
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>About this time Crawford and Seeger, who were intro
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>duced to the Composers Collective by Cowell, were intrigued
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>by folk songs of protest they heard sung at Collective
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>meetings, and by recordings of folk songs and transcriptions of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Southern, white spirituals which subsequently came to their
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>attention. Years earlier. Seeger had attempted unsuccessfully
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>fo relate “concert&quot; music to socioeconomic conditions. Folk
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>songs suddenly seemed to offer a possible solution: here was
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>musie that focused on everyday joys, sorrows and struggles
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>rather than on abstract mathematical concepts, and the sim
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ple melodies often shared certain characteristics of dissonant
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>counterpoint. Together the Seegers decided to put aside their
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>interest in what seemed like an increasingly elite concert
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>musie, to investigate folk music further.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>In 1933, the first of the Seegers four children was born, the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>remaining three followed in 1935, 1937 and 1943.21 In 1935,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Charles Seeger became a technical advisor with the Resettle
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ment Administration in Washington, D.C,so the family left
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>New York-and new music circles-for Silver Spring, Maryland.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>With the exception of Rissolty Rossolty (1941), a short work for
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>small orchestra based on three folk tunes, Crawford stopped
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>composing in 1933 until about 1951. According to Charles
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Seeger, &quot;Ruth stopped composing concert music in 1932 (sic)
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>partly because of our joint discovery of Anglo-American folk
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>music and partly because she was entirely occupied with her
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>four children.&quot;22
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Although raising four children undoubtedly took up a great
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>deal of Crawfords time and energy, she was &quot;entirely cccu-
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pied&quot; with her children for only a few short years. In 1936,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>when her oldest child was three, she began transcribing what
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ultimately amounted to over a thousand field recordings of
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>folk songs from the Archives of American Folk Song in the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Library of Congress, playing and replaying some of them a
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>hundred times.23 Michael Seeger, the eldest child recalls that
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>his mother spent &quot;quite a bit of time with earphones on,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>transcribing songs from scratchy aluminum records behind a
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>locked doorwhere she was just not to be interrupted.&quot;24
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>As the children grew older, they helped perform house
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hold tasks. &quot;My mother did a great variety of things around the
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>house,&quot; says Michael Seeger, &quot;including cooking, and we did
			</p>
			<pb n='44'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>too, and washing dishes, and we did too, and going through all
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the woólen clothes once a year to look for moths, and we did
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>too. ... There was a fair amount of spirit to do these things
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>within the family, including singing together, but very infor
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>mally.&quot;25
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Sometimes the children sang songs from Crawford&apos;s three
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>books for children, which have since become classics (Ameri
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>can Folk Songs for Children, Animal Folk Songs and American
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Folk Songs forvChristmast). Crawford selected the songs to be
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>published, writing piano arrangements and accompaniments
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>for, many of them. She also contributed to John and Alan
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Lomax&apos;s Our Singing Country.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Her accompaniments were widely admired. For example,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>composer and music critic Virgil Thomson, writing in the New
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>York Herald-Tribune, praised the accompariments in Animal
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Folk Songs for their simplicity, calling them &quot;ingeniously apt.”26
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Sidney Robertson Cowell, ethnomusicologist and wife of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Henry Cowell, pinpointed an important difference between
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Crawford&apos;s settings and those more commonly found in folk
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>song books: &quot;They do not derive from a pianistic concept of
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>accompaniment at all, she explains, &quot;but from the nature of
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the instruments traditionally used in the U.S.: banjo, fiddle,
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>guitar and the so-called dulcimer.&quot;27
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Also during this period, Crawford served as consultant or
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>editor on folk music for several publishing houses and govern-
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ment agencies, and she co-edited another Lomax book with
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>her husband. In addition, she was in charge of music at the
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Silver Spring Cooperative Nursery School and taught music at
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Foxhall Nursery School, Whitehall Country School and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Potomac School. She had an incredible ability to communi
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>cate the joy of music to children, and soon developed a large
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>class of private piano students. Thus, Crawford, besides raising
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>four children, was extremely active professionally during this
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>period.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Surely, then, she could have found the time to compose in
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>she wished? The question itself presupposes that the collect
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ing, transcribing-and arranging of authentic folk songs are
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>somehow less-serious, less &quot;important,&quot; than composing
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>classical music. Crawford&apos;s &quot;contagious delight in the vitality
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and variety of folk song&quot;28 was evident to those who knew her
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>or read her books. Her growing interest and expertise in this
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>aspect of American musical heritage may also be vewed as
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>another stage in her development as a composer as was Bar
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tóks discovery of and work with genuine Hungarian folk

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>However, it seems less certain that the scope of Crawford&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>teaching and publishing activities was as much a matter of
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>choice. According to family friends, such employment was in
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>large part economically-motivated.29 Crawford, who sup
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ported herself from the time she left high school, felt a respon

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the Pan American Union from 1941 to 1953. Michael Seeger
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>agrees that there was a certain amount of economic need
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>during this period but adds that &quot;frankly, we didn&apos;t have to be
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>supported to the extent that we were; it was a decision that
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was made to live in a certain way.&quot;30
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Whatever the degree of financial need, there is no dotubt
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that composing classical music offered little in the way of
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>financial remuneration during the 1930s and 40s. In this con

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Thus, just as the economic impact of the Depression played
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a part in Crawford’s decision temporarily to abandon
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>&quot;concert&quot; music in the early 1930s, economic pressures in
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>subsequent years helped postpone her return to composition.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Then, in 1952, with the U.S. on the road to prosperity and her
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>children ranging in age from nine to 19, Crawford completed
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and submitted her Suite for Wind Quintet to a competition
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>sponsored by the Washington, D.C. chapter of the National
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Association for American Composers and Conductors. The
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>quintet, which combines the more abstract, linear and disso
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>nant style of her earlier works with the easy informality and
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>strong rhythmic pulse of folk songs, won first prize. According
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to Charles Seeger, &quot;she would have done more composition
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>then had she lived.&quot;32 Once again, the unexpected intervened
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>this time in the form of a particularly virulent cancer. Ruth
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Crawford died suddenly at home on November 20, 1953, at
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the age of 52.
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Until recently, Crawford’s music has suffered from the kind
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>of neglect that plagues early 20th-century American music in
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>general and women composers in particular. Most obituaries
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>written at the time other death dwelt more on the folk-music

				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Fortunately interest in Crawford has increased consider
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ably since 1973, when Dr. Mary Matilda Caume wrote her
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dissertation on Crawford-the first comprehensive study of
				<lb facs='#facs_44_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Crawford’s relatively small output (a total of 31 works, if the

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>doing. They admired her for what she was doing but it was

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>here and what&apos;s going on here can’t understand you. But you

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>not theirs.&quot;

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>was established under the National Service Bureau of the

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>In 1935 the Seegers moved to Washington, D.C., where

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Occasionally Ruth would accompany Charles on field trips
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>to settlement communities in the Southeast
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>At this time Ruth and Charles met John and Alan Lomax,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>who were also involved in federal folklore projects. Under

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>throughout the United States and had published several
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>songbooks based on these field recordings. They asked Ruth
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>to serve as music editor for their new book, Our Singing
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>Country.“ As she described it:
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In 1935, as a professional musician, I became acquainted
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with folklore, partly through my husband’s work in the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Settlement. In 1937 a man named John Lomax, who has a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>son named Alan Lomax, asked me to act as music editor of a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>book of folk or traditional songs. We listened to thousands
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of songs, out of which two hundred were published. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>impressed, as a professional musician, with certain values in
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>this music which seemed to both of us, and a lot more,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>should be gotten, somehow, to children. Here were things
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that weren’t just beautiful melodies — a sort of unfinished
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ness in the music, it kept on going. Professional music isn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>like that; it always tells you when it is going to end. Vigor is
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>an overused word, but it certainly is there —non-stop, rhyth
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mic quality, and chiefly, the thing l was talking about a while
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ago, improvisational qualities. If only you could play with
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>this music, if you could bring it right home!
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Our Singing Country, published in 1941, embraced a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>wide geographical area and included varied types of songs.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Aunt Molly Jackson supplied comments throughout the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>book on the tunes and their traditions. Ruth transcribed
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>over 300 tunes from the Lomaxes&apos; field recordings, from
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>which 90 were finally chosen for the book. According to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>John Lomax: &quot;Mrs. Seeger, in some instances, played a rec
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ord hundreds of times in an effort to attain perfection in her
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>translation of the tune.&quot; Ruth was also asked to write a pre
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>face describing her approach to transcription. The Lomaxes
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>only wanted a few pages, but before she realized it Ruth had
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>written about 80 pages. In this unpublished document, Ruth
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>analyzed the folk songs, presented her theory of transcribing
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tunes, and discussed performance practices in traditional
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>music. Musical examples illustrated her discussions.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Ruth later drew on her experience with folk music to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>compose Rissolty Rossolty, completed in 1941. The themes
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>for this composition were based on transcriptions from field
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>recordings housed in the Archive of Folk Song at the Library
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of Congress. Pete Seeger recalled how Ruth was com
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>missioned to write this piece:
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>The nearest thing of her getting back into composition was
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>in 1941 when Alan was doing the “American School of the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Air&quot; and CBS commissioned some short pieces based on folk
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>songs. They would have someone like Aunt Molly sing a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>song and then an orchestra would play an orchestral
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>arrangement using that same melody.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>The one she did was Rissolty Rossolty. It was a delightful
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>piece and she worked hard on it. It was a small amount of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>money they paid—$400.00 for months and months of hard
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>work that was all over in three minutes. Father did one too.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>think she eventually wanted to go back to composing
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>but when her children were grown up and off her hands. She
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>might have based some of her compositions on folk songs.

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The Golden Age of American ragtime spanned a period
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of 25 years from the late 1890s to the early 1920s. The exact
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>origin of the word &quot;ragtime” is a mystery. Some claim that
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the word derives from the music’s ragged, syncopated
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>melody line,’ while others believe it is a carry-over from a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>popular dance step known as ragging. A number of histories
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and textbooks describe the ragtime era in American music
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>history, define its musical form, and identify the many com
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>posers of piano rags. Few sources, however, mention the
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>female rag composers and those that do give them only
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>minimal coverage.? This is unfortunate for at least 50
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>women wrote rags — and good ones at that.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In perusing ragtime discographies, record jackets, old

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>composed and published by women.” And undoubtedly
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>many, many more are awaiting discovery. This beginning
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>research on female rag composers provides some interest
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ing revelations about women and ragtime. First, the known
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>female composers were white while ragtime, in general, was
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>a black, male-dominated field. Second, the ragtime women
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>were mainly middle-class, classically trained pianists.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Third, most composed only in their younger years; they
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tended to terminate their careers once they married. As a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>result, few of these women earned lasting reputations as
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>composers.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>In the early years of ragtime, from approximately 1897
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to 1905, several women were active. Little information
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>about the women themselves is available —only their music
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>offers clues. Sadie Koninsky, for example, was probably one
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>of the earliest composers. Many ragtime historians consider
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>cakewalk compositions to be forerunners of ragtime.3 Her
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>&quot;Eli Green’s Cakewalk” (1897) was an early success.“ At least
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>five recordings have been made of this composition dating
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>from 1897 to the present. One conjecture is that Koninsky
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>may have been from the New York area since at least two of
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>her cakewalk pieces were published by Joseph W. Stern and
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Company, a New York firm.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Another early rag composer was Louise V. Gustin. Her

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Gustin apparently was quite prolific — compositions of hers
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>were released in 1899, 1900, and 1901. She probably resided

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>apolis). Aufderheide not only played an active part in the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>development of ragtime in Indianapolis, but she was also a
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>well-trained popular classical pianist.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Her compositions, with the exception of one, were pub
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>lished by her father, John H. Aufderheide. This publishing

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Indianapolis-Ohio Valley area.” Both this rag and her
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ragtime composition “The Thriller” (1909) were very popular
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with New Orleans jazz groups. In fact, the great New

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Aufderheide’s father also published the rags of her
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>friends: Julia Lee Niebergall, Cladys Yelvington, Cecil
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Duane Cobb, Will Morrison, and Paul Pratt. Pratt, the

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>She died in Pasadena, California, on September 1, 1972.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Unlike many of the other ragtime women, Julia Lee
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Niebergall (1886-1968) maintained a career in music
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>throughout her life. For years she was a pianist at the Colon
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ial Theater in Indianapolis. She, like her colleague May
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Aufderheide, contributed a number of important pieces to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the Indianapolis ragtime scene. Three of her rags—&quot;Hoosier
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Rag&quot; (1907), &quot;Horseshoe Rag&quot; (1911), and “Red Rambler
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Rag” (1912)—were choice rags of the period. (The latter two
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>were published by J.H. Aufderheide.)
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Niebergall seems to have been quite a liberated woman
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>for her time. After her early marriage and subsequent
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>divorce, she resumed her maiden name. In addition, she
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>owned her own home, where she lived until her death.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>According to Max Morath, she was one of the first women in
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Indianapolis to own an automobile.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Cladys Yelvington (1891-1957) was also active in Indian
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>apolis ragtime, although she was not as prolific a composer
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>as her friends May Aufderheide and Julia Lee Niebergall.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Only one published composition is known—“Piffle Rag
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>(1911). Her professional career as a composer and a silent

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Constance Mering or Vee Lawnhurst. She also composed

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>other women who contributed to the ragtime repertory.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Many, many women have been identified in sheet music
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>collections, ragtime discographies, and histories.&quot;5 Some

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>appear to have published just one rag while others pro

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>This quick look at the women of ragtime may provoke
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>more questions than it answers. Why, for instance, have
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>historians not reported the importance of women in rag
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>time? How can we uncover more biographical information
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>about these women when they are not listed in any of the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>standard histories, trade directories, etc? How extensively
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>were women discriminated against in the publishing busi
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ness? Did the ragtime women use pseudonyms in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>get their works published or use initials to hide their sex? If
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>so, we may find many more works by women composers.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Certainly more research is needed to bring into focus the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>forgotten ragtime women. A few recordings are already
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>available of quality rags by female composers and, one
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hopes, in the near future more recordings will be forth
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>coming. The women of ragtime must be accorded their
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>proper place in music history and be given the recognition
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>they properly deserve.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>1. Piano ragtime is unique in opposing a syncopated melody against an
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>even, accented bass. Rags are typically divided into three or four sec
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tions (each usually consisting of 32 beats) and based largely on the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords of the major mode.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>2. One notable exception is Rags and Ragtime by David A. Jasen and

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>But, yet and still (as a later Simple said) we had not died
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>before our time. We were refusing to be swept away. We
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>were staying put.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Bessie went further. Since the Apocalypse was a con

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Bessie Smith redefined our time. In a deliberate in

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>damental sexuality was to survival. Where work was
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>often the death of us, sex brought us back to life. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>better than food, and sometimes a necessary substitute.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>With her, black women in American culture could no
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>longer just be regarded as sexual objects. She made us

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sexuality for black women. The importance of this is
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>often lost. During a period when The Birth of a Nation

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she delineates the difference between washwomen and
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>scullions. This song is a classical lament, in the rhythm of
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the work being done. She sings:
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>All day long l’m slavin, all day long l’m bustin suds.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Cee, my hands are tired, washin out these dirty duds.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Proceeding to describe the volume of the workload she
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>is expected to handle and its effects, she says:

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Cot myself a-achin from my head down to my shins
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Most striking, however, is her image of deliverance:
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Rather be a scullion, cookin in some white folks’ yard.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I could eat up plenty, wouldn’t have to work so hard.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>With these words, she reminds us that the old plantation

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>servants persists and that being a house servant is still a

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Most of her comments on domestic economy, how
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ever, center on the struggle to construct a relationship of

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>With total candor, she voices what Prof. Howard Stretch

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>culture as a means of elaborating our style. She then
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>went on to mainline the blend.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>First, she made urban blues urbane. All-wise. In Cole

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>fruit instead of meat. A delicacy, to sample. A black
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>woman, yes; and a lady.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>From back alley stairs to (Small’s) Paradise, we had
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>made the climb. Appetizing, young, fresh and still un

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>about it all. And did. She said: “Let the poets pipe of

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>perfumed. It could be sung to strings. In so doing, she
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>represented a black woman who could conquer white

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>balance, however, she stirred a bitter brew. The silk and

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>twenty years. Billie Holiday was one of the many Ameri
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>can casualties. Korea, Vietnam, Sharpeville, rape, lynch
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ings, and Jim Crow law all added fuel to the fire. In spite
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of the official freeze on information (called the Cold
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>War), we heard of how other border skirmishes multi

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Nina Simone
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>In the 1960s, Nina Simone used her music to revive
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>our roots, to internationalize the terms of our self
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>determination, and to develop the cultural dimension of
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>armed struggle. More than any of her predecessors, she
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was able to fuse ideology and art. Her perspective was
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that the whole world was being Africanized and for us
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to take our place on the stage of history, our awareness
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>has to encompass the world. So, she opened old trade
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>routes and plotted new explorers&apos; maps, whose only
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>boundaries were determined by the &quot;geography of our

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In &quot;Four Women,&quot; she told the tale of violations
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>marking our lives in the U.S. With just that one song, she
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>took us all the way back to &quot;Washwoman’s Blues,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>through “Tricks,&quot; and watered the bitter crop Billie
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Holiday knew had been sown. In songs like &quot;Seeline

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;Sinnerman,&quot; &quot;Zungo
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and &quot;One More Sunday in Savannah,” she cultivated our
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>folk memory. She invoked all the weapons we had used
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in the past to protect ourselves when organization failed:
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>incantation, congregation, conjure, slave religion, dis
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>sembling, the appropriation of European and Anglo
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>American culture. But she put them to use in a situation
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and at a time when organization was developing and we
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>were contending for power. The historical moment was
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>such that, through her voice, even songs like I Shall Be
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Released” took on a meaning relevant to our political
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>struggle. Her most personal melodies (e.g., &quot;When I Was
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in My Prime” and “Wild Is the Wind”) always contained
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>undertones of suppressed rebellion. When she began her
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>crescendo, no one could ignore the dominant theme.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Nina Simone was not the first to be so direct. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>1930s Bessie Smith could say to the rich:
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>While you’re living in your mansion
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>You don’t know what hard times mean

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Your wife is livin like a queen.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The difference was that Bessie Smith concluded this
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>song by pleading with the rich to have mercy on her
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>plight and appealing to their conscience by asking: &quot;If it
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>wasn’t for the poor man,/Mr. Rich Man, what would you
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>do?&quot; By the 1960s, Nina Simone was taking the offensive.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>She performed “Old Jim Crow&quot; and &quot;Backlash Blues” to
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>white audiences who knew they were under attack and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to black audiences who were seizing the time. She wrote
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;show tunes&quot; like &quot;Mississippi, Goddam&quot; and intro
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>duced them by saying &quot;the show hadn’t been written for
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>them yet.” Her voice rang with social judgment, and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>there were no rebuttals when she told white America:
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Don&apos;t tell me, l&apos;II tell you
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Me and my people just about due

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>But that’s just the trouble—too slow
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Desegregation, mass participation, unification—too slow
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Do things gradually and bring more tragedy.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>You don’t have to live next to me
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Just leave me my equality.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Cause everybody knows about Mississippi, Coddam.
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>When that message was taken up by the poorest
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>among us, and all the major cities in the U.S. were being
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>shaken by black rebellion, most white folk were either
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>striking back or asking &quot;Why?” Nina Simone was answer
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ing by performing &quot;Pirate Jenny.&quot; She had chosen care
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>fully. She took a song originating in English light opera,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>adapted by German socialists Bertolt Brecht and Kurt
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Weil to comment on life in pre-fascist Germany, and
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>transformed it to apply to the anti-colonial revolutionary
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>spirit growing in the American South, the Caribbean,
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>South Africa. and situations south of every border. This
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>was the coming storm that her prevailing Southerly
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>blew. And, in the midst of it, still smiling, “looking nice
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>with a ribbon in her hair,/but counting the heads as she&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>making the beds, was Aunt Sarah, Sister Sadie, Pirate

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>be first. In 1969, the song that Nina Simone wrote to say
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_5_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>it was &quot;Revolution.&quot; The last verse went as follows:

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Well, you know, you got to clean your brain.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The only way that we can stand in fact

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The only issue was, how to do it. For that, we needed
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>more than prophetic vision and exhortation.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>If that last among us were truly to take command, all
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the weaknesses that our condition enforced had to be

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>people transform themselves as well as the social, eco
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>nomic, and political structures that governed our devel

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Simone directed our gaze, protracted struggles and long
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>marches began. And there was nothing mystical about
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the trip. One such earthly pilgrim was Esther Phillips.

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>diver, she plumbed the depths of our degradation before
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>surfacing with a synthesis. When on land, she said, &quot;If it

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Nothing was inevitable about the destination. She

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and the other would lead far into the night. In songs like

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>In her middle passage, she rediscovers something of

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In the ’70s, the strenuous nature of those battles burned
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>many people out. In political circles, varieties of separa

				<lb facs='#facs_59_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The blues covers a wide spectrum of experience. It is a

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>When the classic blues singers sang and recorded in the

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cided to offer some of these blues to a wider public. Which
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>songs do you think they chose? You guessed it. They chose
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the sad, suffering “Daddy Won’t You Please Come Home?
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>rather than &quot;Trust No Man” and I Can’t Use You No More.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>country blues with their African influence and the new
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>sounds of the blues instrumentalists with their European in

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>they combinèd these different systems in the same phrase.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Their rich use of the vernacular, sometimes with bravura,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>sometimes with fastidious precision, sometimes with
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>baroque embellishments, sometimes as incantation, affirms
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>their aliveness.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>These women were royalty in the truest sense, and they
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>knew it. Their titles were earned in American democratic
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>fashion. When Bessie Smith was called the Empress, an
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>acknowledgment of her ultimate supremacy, no one ques
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tioned it. It was accepted as gospel truth because of the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>quality of her singing style, which was professional and
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>urban.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The blues women were not innocents. They used all the

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>decking themselves with glitter and glamour, in silks and

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>all, stand out. The first requirement of a super-woman is that
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>she herself know that she is one.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Bessie Smith was an archetype. For every archetype
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>there must be hundreds of other women, some of them even
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>coming close to her effectiveness. And there were many
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>women who expressed themselves in the blues individually,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>where the sound and the story blend the meaning together,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>making it all seem as natural as talking to a friend. But we
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>have not heard about more than a handful.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Imagine Bessie Smith, in her majestic manner, standing
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>on the stage of a black tent show or theater, full of poor
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>working women, sitting motionless in awe, and there she is,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>one of them who has made it, looking like the biggest suc
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>cess in the universe, belting out in her full, rich voice with
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the intensity of high drama, &quot;Dirty No-Gooder’s Blues&quot;:
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Did you ever fall in love
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>with a man that was no good?
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>It was like being in church, only better, because the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>preacher was a beautiful black woman singing about their
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>lives in the here and now, not after death. Every woman who
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>heard her identified with her. Bessie would give out the call
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and they would respond: Say it sister. You know it. Amen.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Lawd, I really don’t think no man’s love can last.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>They’Il love you to death then treat you like a thing of the past.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>There’s nineteen men livin in my neighborhood,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Eighteen of them are fools and the one ain’t no doggone good.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>It’s no wonder that people said she hypnotized audiences
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and that, when Bessie was singing, you could hear a pin
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>drop. The sales of her records were so great that they
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>virtually pulled the ailing Columbia record company away
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>from the edge of bankruptcy onto solid ground.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>It must be understood that most areas of these women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lives were not under their control. That is why when they did
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>assert themselves in their private lives, when they decided
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>where to give affection, when they refused to accept a vio
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>lation of their dignity, we place those times in bold relief
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and admire their courage. These singers, remember, repre
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>sent many women, and we must not lose sight of the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that when a woman was working a job, especially when she
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>had children to support, she couldn’t be very independent.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>So that, in her personal life, when she was independent, that
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>action becomes heroic.
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>It is this assertiveness we hear in Bessie Smith&apos;s &quot;Young

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Wild women don’t have the blues.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>It is the directness of this expression that makes these
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>legendary blues so compelling. They were fashioned from
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>women’s everyday lives and turned into art, and they
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>become our ancestral wisdom. When we listen to them, our
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>own experience becomes reinforced, clarified, intensified.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>They awaken in us more dimensions, giving us a fuller,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>richer, and more intimate sense of our own lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Although the structure of the twelve-bar blues is formal,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>there is plenty of room for improvisation, so that the same
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>idea can be expressed in many different ways. The following
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>classic example by Ma Rainey is a strikingly poetic one:
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>If you don’t like my ocean,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Don’t fish in my sea,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Stay out of my valley,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>And let my mountain be.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>It was restated by Bessie Smith:
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>If you don’t like my peaches,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Don’t shake my tree.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Many years later Billie Holiday used these lines too, as did
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>many of the classic blues singers.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>These incisive metaphors are the words of proud
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>women. Nowhere in American literature do we find poetry
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>more eloquent than these oral expressions from black
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>American culture. Emily Dickinson, Edna St. Vincent Millay,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and Marianne Moore would have agreed, I am sure, that
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>matching this richness would be difficult.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Yet these women aren’t recognized enough as artists.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>They are not given the credit they deserve for having con
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tributed so much to America’s indigenous art, jazz. The
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>blues is to jazz what yeast is to bread; without it, it’s flat. The
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>classic blues singers make up a substantial segment of the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>bedrock of American music.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Ma Rainey took country blues, a folk expression, and
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>put it on the stage around the turn of the century, when she
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>was only fourteen, shaping it and starting it on its way to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>becoming a distinct musical form. Before that, what was to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>become the blues covered a huge range of unrelated musi
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>cal folk material such as mother’s lullabies, spirituals
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>gospel, ring-shouts (a highly rhythmic circle dance), field
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>hollers, street cries, work songs, prison gang songs, as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>songs sung on the docks and levees and particularly the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>songs of itinerant guitarists and banjo players. They all had
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>a strong melodic line, which is central to the blues. They
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>used freely pitched notes, which derive from African music
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and have come to be called blue notes. They are crucial to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>the blues sound.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Looking back at the song titles listed above, we can see
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the roots of a vital tradition, one certainly worthy of cele
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>bration as part of our musical legacy. Women’s concerns and

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>women. When Lucille Bogan sings “Sweet Petunia,&quot; she is
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>using the same botanical metaphor for the vulva, musically,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>as Georgia O’Keefe used in painting in that decade.

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>’Press my button, ring my bell.&quot; And they gave instructions,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>mingled with humor but nonetheless specific.

				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Gospel music made an indelible mark on my life.I
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>can remember so well as a child in East St. Louis, Illinois,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>listening to gospel music on the radio, at church, and in
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>concert. Gospel music was very popular, and many songs
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that were recorded then, during the Golden Era of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Cospel (1945-1960), went on to become classics. Any
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>weekday for at least four hours during the day and four
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>hours in the evening, gospel music was broadcast on one
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>of the radio stations. The station was usually one that
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>catered to the musical ears of the Black community. On
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Saturday gospel music was played for ten to twelve
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>hours, and on Sunday at least eighteen hours of radio
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>time were set aside for gospel music. But the highlight of
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>listening to gospel music for me was Sunday morning at
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the New Hope Baptist Church.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The church was on one of the main streets of the city.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It was a medium-sized church with modest decor. The
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>pews were wooden, and when they became filled, metal
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>folding chairs were put in the aisle. The choir loft accom
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>modated approximately thirty people. The pulpit was
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>furnished with three upholstered chairs — one with a very
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>high back for the minister and two others with lower
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>backs, one on each side, for two of the assistants. Other
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>assistants sat in metal folding chairs. There were three
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sections of pews separated by aisles. I always tried to get
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>a seat in the middle section or the aisle of pews on the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>left side of the church so I could see the choir processional
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>from close range.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The atmosphere Sunday morning at the New Hope
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Baptist Church was always one of excitement. It was the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>climax of Saturday’s preparation... getting clothes ready
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to wear, having your hair &quot;done up, cooking the Sunday
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>meal. Women wore their best—nice suits; beautiful
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>dresses; hats trimmed with flowers and ribbons; well
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>polished, often too-tight shoes; oversized purses; white
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dress gloves.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The New Hope Baptist Church was a neighborhood
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>church; only a handful of people outside the neighbor
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>hood attended. There was much scurrying around before
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the service, greeting people you might not have seen
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>during the week. I always rushed to get my seat to wit-
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ness the processional. That was the signal that the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>service had begun. It was exciting to watch the choir
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>members march down the aisle to the choir loft to the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>beat of the processional hymn. The women clasped their
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>hands together and held them in front at their waists. The
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>men clasped their hands and held them at their backside.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>They stood erect and took slow strides forward until they
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>reached the choir loft; then they would glide sideways
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>until they reached their seats.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>There were several singing groups in the church: the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Gospel Chorus, Male Chorus, Senior Choir, and Young
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>People’s Choir. They always wore color-coordinated
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>outfits — maroon robes, black dresses with white colors,
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>dark skirts and white blouses, grey robes. The groups
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>took turns, singing on different Sundays. On special
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>occasions, they all sang together.
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Musical selections were interspersed between the
				<lb facs='#facs_63_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>prayers, offerings, announcements (there were many),

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>remember the sisters in the church rambling through
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>their purses, feeling for peppermints, and discreetly
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>(somewhat) putting them in their mouths.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Music entertained us children, and we participated in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that part of the service, singing along with the music
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>group. The sermon lectured and scolded, and somehow
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>we tried to escape.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In gospel music rhythm is the primary ingredient...
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the message is secondary. I remember it was difficult, in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>most cases, to understand the words that were said, but
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>it didn’t matter as long as you captured the rhythm and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the repetitious chorus. It was not what was said so much
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>as how it was said. Gospel music plays to the emotions.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>The object is to get an emotional response through the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>repetitious drive — repetition of both rhythmic patterns
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and lyrics.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>The music, religion, and culture of Black America are
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>basically African in origin, and this is reflected in their
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>form and substance. The tunes and rhythms of gospel are
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>rooted in the earlier music of the Black Church. The link
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>between Africa—the ancestral home of Black Americans
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>— and the survival in the Western experience—through
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>slavery, segregation, political oppression, etc.— can be
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>identified in that oral tradition. Elements from European
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>hymns are combined with the moans, groans, and chants
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of Mother Africa, creating a distinctly new sound
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>spirituals.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Some gospel music is composed, while some is im

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>songs. Some pieces are even take-offs on other songs
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that may or may not have a religious origin. Lyrics can be
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>tailored to the situation and arrangements made to fit the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>needs of the particular singing group. Sometimes stan

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>rhythmical foot-stomping song—Afro-American style.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>But even though the words are not the number one ele
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ment in a gospel song, they make a great impression just
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the same on those who tune into them.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The stories told through gospel music cover a broad
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>range of subjects. Some are Biblical, with the verses
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>made up of Bible stories and psalms. Some tell of life
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>experiences, joyous celebration, and tragedy. Many are
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>teaching songs; others songs of praise. Some are pro
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>phetic, telling of future events; others are invitations.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Some are complacent, some political. There are songs
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>filled with rage, or with anger and frustration.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>To some, gospel is entertainment. To most, gospel
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>music saves souls and lives, lightens burdens, and mends
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>broken hearts. More than this, however, as Wyatt Tee
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Walker has said, “What Black people are singing
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>religiously will provide a clue as to what is happening to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>them sociologically.&quot; In his book Somebodys Calling My
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Name, he traces the use of music in worship with a view
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>toward demonstrating that Black people’s singing is in a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>specific context of social circumstances. His survey of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the musical content of the Black religious tradition
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>serves as an accurate commentary on what was happen
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>ing to the Black community and its response to those
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>conditions.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Female singing groups dominated the gospel music
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>field, and gospel audiences were at least 75% women.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Women have always played a leading role and have, in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>some cases, been the controlling influence in gospel
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>music —it’s probably a stronger role than women have

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Marion Williams
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>played in any other kind of music in America. Women
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>have always organized, conducted, composed, arranged,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>supervised, and sung—from the beginning, even before
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>gospel music’s phenomenal commercial success. I can
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>remember in particular a woman directing the &quot;Male
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Chorus&quot; of the church I attended as a child.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In Black Baptist churches, women preachers were
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>nonexistent and singing gospel music afforded some
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>women the opportunity to &quot;preach.” In the middle of a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>song, while the pianist played a chord, the soloist would
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>&quot;expound” on the word, witnessing and testifying of per
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sonal experiences. The &quot;message” got across. The very
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>same preachers who did not condone women preaching
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>were the ones who got the greatest enjoyment from
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>these women&apos;s&quot;solos.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Once women began expressing themselves through
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>gospel music in the church, they were encouraged and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>strengthened to further assert themselves in all spheres
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of life, just as many brave Black women had done in the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>past. Sometimes this was related to the church but it was
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>also outside of the church—in the community, in politics.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>We see evidence of this especially in the Civil Rights
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>movement, where women were in the foretront of Civil
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Rights organizations and in administrative and teaching
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>positions at Black colleges in the South. These women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>expression through music and in other areas of life was
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>backed up by other women who maybe weren’t as vocal
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>but who were supportive just the same—&quot;with them” all
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the way
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>From the time of the first gospel hit in the mid-1940s,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>gospel music also provided some women with a degree
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of financial independence, and therefore freedom in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>their art and their life styles. They received an income

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that allowed them to wear stylish clothes, ride in fine

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>cial means.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The new female gospel solo artists and gospel singing
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>groups grew out of the original choirs. They carried on
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and expanded the tradition as they made their own original
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>contributions. Yet, although women made up the majority
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of the performers and the audience at gospel concerts, it
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>is ironic that there are so few known women gospel com
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>posers. Women did compose, but they did not receive
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the recognition. They were unaware, in some cases, of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>how to protect their rights to their original music. Only a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>pittance of the people—men and women—who wrote
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>gospel tunes ever actually benefited from the sales.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>But now l’d like to mention a few who sang during
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the Golden Era of Gospel. The Caravans from Chicago
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>produced gospel soloists Inez Andrews, Albertina
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Walker, Cassiata George, and Shirley Ceasar. Shirley
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Ceasar is from Durham, North Carolina, and won a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Grammy Award in 1972 as the best Soul Gospel Per
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>former for her rendition of &quot;Put Your Hand in the Hand&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>written by Gene McClellan. The Clara Ward Singers of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Philadelphia were the first gospel group to sell a million
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>copies of a recording. Soloist Marion Williams, from this
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>group, is still recording. She has composed such songs as
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Crown Him Lord of All,&quot; &quot;Heaven Belongs to You,&quot; and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>&quot;Lord l’ve Had My Way.&quot; The Roberta Martin Singers of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Chicago birthed Gloria Griffin. Roberta Martin com
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>posed many of the songs that her group sang, individually
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and in collaboration with Thomas Dorsey. The Cospel
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Harmonetts of Birmingham, Alabama, gave rise to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Dorothy Love Coates. She, too, is still recording and has
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>composed such songs as “Every Day Will Be Sunday,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>&quot;Hide Me Jesus,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>&quot;Dark Day in Jerusalem,&quot; and &quot;l&apos;m
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Trying. There were other songwriters during the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Golden Era of Gospel—Mahalia Jackson, Lucie Camp
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>bell, Beatrice Brown, and Virginia Davis, to name a few
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>more.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>can remember so well listening to Clara Ward and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the Ward Singers as they sang these words written by
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>James Brewster for them:
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Surely... Surely...Surely... Surely
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>He’s able...to carry... you through.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>This song carried a message of hope. Every Black gospel
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>chorus had &quot;Surely God Is Able” in its repertoire. Marion
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Williams was the soloist on this number. I remember
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>hearing Marion Williams on the radio as she blasted
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>through with:
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Don’t you know Cod is able,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>He’s able, He’s able, Cod is able
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Iwas easily convinced, from listening to that strong female
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>voice, that He was able.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Mahalia Jackson, truly one of the giants of gospel,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>was known world-wide for her singing. She combined
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>powerful vitality with great dignity and strong religious
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>conviction. Miss Jackson was introduced to the gospel
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>music world by Thomas Dorsey (a household name in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>gospel music for composing and arranging). When

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Nor can I forget the Davis Sisters from Philadelphia
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and their popular recording “Twelve Gates to the City.

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Gospel had a profound effect on my life. My imagination
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>soared and would at times dive to unbelievable depths
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>as I dreamed about the experiences that the singers pro
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>claimed in song.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>It is interesting to note that during the development
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>of gospel, this &quot;new music&quot; was often met with some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>hostility in the Methodist and other Protestant churches
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Many considered it &quot;sin music.&quot; In fact, there was luke
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>warm reception to gospel in the more conservative Bap
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tist churches.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>But gospel began to move out of the church. There
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>was an abundance of gospel concerts during the 1950s in
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the East St. Louis area. They were produced by local
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>producers—usually disc jockeys. It was a special treat
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>when I was able to attend a concert at a concert hall, the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>high school gymnasium or auditorium or a church. I can
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>remember hearing the Staple Singers, who are now popu
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>lar pop singers, many local gospel artists like Brother
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Hugh Dent and Brother Joe Mays, plus many others,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>including the O&apos;Neal Twins of St. Louis and the Five
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Blind Boys of Memphis. These concerts usually consisted
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>of several groups, and they generated the most fantastic
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>rhythmic excitement.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Later gospel was incorporated into show business. In
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the early 1960s, Marion Williams starred in the Broadway
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>production of Black Nativity, a gospel musical with
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>script by Langston Hughes. Her rocking arrangement of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Christmas carols and spirituals became the show’s trade
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mark. Another Langston Hughes musical, Tambourines to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Clory, was based on the storefront churches of Harlem,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>where gospel singing was a feature. Clara Ward was a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>member of that cast. In the mid-1970s the Broadway
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>musical, Bubbling Brown Sugar included a rollicking gos

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>pel number &quot;His Eye Is on the Sparrow.&quot; There were
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>others— Vinette Carroll’s musical adaptation of James
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Weldon Johnson’s God’s Trombone: Your Arms Too Short
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to Box with God which is again playing on Broadway, and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Don’t Bother Me l Can’t Cope.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The 1960s also produced the Utterbach Ensemble,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>founded by Clinton Utterbach. Beatrice Utterbach, his
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>mother, penned some of their songs. The Ensemble
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>brought together a group of singers (mostly women) who
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were exceptionally trained and sensitive to the dramatic
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>quality of gospel. It introduced to the gospel arena the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>use of classical techniques, weaving European-style
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>music with the vitality and spirit of gospel. The result
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was phenomenal. In a form of music that is very free
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Clinton Utterbach imposed a discipline and style
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>designed to maximize the effect of the music. That style
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was unique, and the quality of the singers added tremen
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dously to the superiority of the group. There is some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>thing about a live performance that cannot be matched
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and Utterbach knew how to use the theatrics of per
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>formance. He tugged at the hearts of folks. There was
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>no way you could experience this without being taken in.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The thrilling musicianship of Naomi Thomas of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Hackensack, New Jersey, and Mildred Brown of New
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Rochelle, New York, former members of the Utterbach
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Ensemble, is evident as they now sing gospel and minister
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>in prisons in the New York area. The alto and soprano
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>voices of these two women offer an incomparable blend
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and quality. Naomi Thomas has written the lyrics and
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>music for many of the songs sung by this duo, including
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>&quot;Praise Belongs to Our God,&quot; “We’ve Been Brought from
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Sin to Righteousness, and &quot;He’Il Supply Your Needs.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Gospel continues. And it will continue to continue.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Some have said that the great gospel witnesses will not
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>come again. I contend they are here. Audiences are no
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>longer only interested in the &quot;beat”; they are hungry for
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and responding to the &quot;message.&quot; And I might add, some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>remain in church after the choir has sung to hear the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>message” given by the minister.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>On any given Sunday you can hear the likes of past

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>covers the gamut of gospel singing—with one exception:
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>their messages are positive. I can relate to the testimony
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>of Frances Capers, whose mellow, soothing, triumphant
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>voice so eloquently belts out “God Is Not Dead.&quot;” The

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>An extra treat at Tabernacle of Prayer is when the

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>getting itself together, furthermore at the time when the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>music was developing there was a severe social prohibition
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>against women being involved in any kind of commercial en
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>deavor. women performers were thought to be harlots by
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>most decent people. even high class opera singers and big
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>time actresses (white) were often regarded as somewhat less
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>than ladylike. so you know what was said about jazzwomen.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>with all this, it&apos;s not surprising that most parents didn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>(and still don’t) want their sons to be jazz musicians or any
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>other kind of artist, let alone their daughters. it’s a rough life,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>a dangerous life. even for men. wild. fast. uncontrollable.

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>parents think it&apos;s better for their kid to have something
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>steady. lots of parents didn’t (don’t) want their daughters to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>even date a musician, musicians are full of stories about
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>being told—sometimes at gunpoint or knifepoint—by
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>parents to stay away from their houses cuz they are raising
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>their daughter to be decent and don’t want to see her with
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>any wild man.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>so it&apos;s understandable that few people encouraged their
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>daughters to learn to play drums or saxophone. besides,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>everybody knows that girls take dance or piano or voice
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>maybe flute or harp. right? and most parents have no plans
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>for their daughters to ever earn a living as a result of their
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dance, piano, voice lessons. the lessons are just something

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>today the women who are not afraid to be honest have

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the days when men didn’t have to put up any pretenses
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>about their prejudices about women. can you imagine being

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>and club owners and worked her way up to going on the

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>in polite conversation, the girl singer was called names
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>like sparrow, wren, warbler, chirp. regardless of her talent
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>she first had to fill the bill as a beautiful, charming, gracious,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>delicate, softspoken ornament. in fact, if you wanted to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>singer or instrumentalist, you had better be beautiful,

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>and then you had better be ready for the outright proposi

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we have seen that traditionally jazzwomen had to be
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>acceptable first as ornament/objects. as if this is not already
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bad enough, if we take a careful look at official jazzhistory
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>(or american history or the history of western civilization),
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>we will see that the most desirable ornament/objects have
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>been those with flowing hair, blue eyes and white skin.

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>but there is an even deeper irony to the situation. the

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>black male prerogative. jazz has been one of the few pieces
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>of turf held almost unquestionably by black males. like box
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ing. every now and then a new great white hope emerges

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>conversely, it seems that once jazz (like boxing) became
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a profitable and big business, white men have not brooked

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>shows us that the trickbag of cultural ripoff is deeper yet
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>because white women are still being promoted over black
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>women. the first trick out of the bag was the promotion of

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>white men over black men for racist reasons. the next trick
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>has been white women’s promotion over black women for

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>out of the bag though, it is clear they are all designed to

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the same way we are not allowed to control another, even
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>more important resource —our labor power.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>although white jazz entrepreneurs deny making any real

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>about black women and white male control are overlooked,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>uncomfortable as they make some people?
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in addition to this pressure exerted on her from external
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>sources, the black jazzwoman also faces internal pressures
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that often prohibit her creative expansion. because her
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>physical features don’t conform to the popular mold she
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>must prove her femininity—must in fact first prove her
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>humanity. there is more pressure on her to conform to the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>usual feminine standard—pressure from her family, from
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>her man, from her peers and community. so it is harder for
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>her to rebel. those who do rebel are often made to feel
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>guilty, as though their rebellion is directly responsible for
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the demasculization of black men. this sexist internal pres
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sure is often more difficult to overcome than the racist and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sexist external pressure.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>so the black woman is caught in crossfire —between a
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>rock and a hard place. if it was hard for any woman to play
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>saxophone and drums, it was even harder for black women.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>it is easier to rebel if you already have some kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>approval that gives you a leg to stand on. and the black
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>woman knows that even if she does have the courage to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>rebel against the traditional ways and choose an
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>untraditional life for herself in the arts— in jazz—she will
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>find that certain realities seem to form the bottom line no
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>matter where she goes. she is still the low person on the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>totem pole. not only is she a woman, she is black. not only is
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>she black, she is a woman.

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>what are the black women who are in jazz today doing
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to make sure they are seen, heard and appreciated? at this
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>time we see many of them becoming dynamic and vocal
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>members of organizations — organizations they’ve helped
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to form for the purpose of assisting young musicians with
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>promotion, publicity, education and work. an example of

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>many black women in other creative disciplines — paint
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ing and writing, for example—have built collectives and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>support groups geared to their specific needs. an example of

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>by Akua Lezli Hope (italics):
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Is jazz singer an accurate description of you, for you?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>That’s as close as anything you can get...1 can’t describe
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the style, it’s a feeling that 1 get... Describing your style?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>That would pin it down, pin it down to a certain way that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>you do things all the time. That&apos;s not what happens
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>That’s what jazz is all about. It changes all the time. My
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>music is always ... every time I do it it’s something dif
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ferent. Something different happens all the time. And
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>that is what jazz is. It’s not programmed, in other words.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Improvisation.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Well, it’s not programmed. l’d say a lot of people are
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>improv. A lot of people do a lot of things with improvi
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>sation. But it’s a feeling that you get, too. Just because
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>you improvise doesn’t mean you are capable of doing
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>jazz. A lot of horn players can improvise but they don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>have a jazz feeling. That is what is the unique thing about
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>it. It’s a certain Feeling that you’ve got to have when
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>you’re interpreting it.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Does that Feeling come from creativity, approach, or a
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>certain musical style?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>It’s all of that combined—creativity, the approach, the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>attitude....(And)it’s a Black attitude. It’s Black music.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>How did you come to singing?
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>didn’t really know that 1 was going to be a singer be-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>cause I didn’t have no beautiful voice. I had a good ear
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>for hearing music; I listened to a lot of music, a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>instruments; I didn’t listen to any singers, though. I listened
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>to singers by accident on the radio, or at a club, or things
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>like that, but 1 didn’t go out and buy a stack of, say, Bessie
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Smith records or Billie Holiday records or Sarah Vaughan
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>records and play them all the time. I listened to more
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>music, more horns, than I did singers.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>You seem to approach your voice like an instrument.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Time helped me develop that. I didn’t know that&apos;s what
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>was starting out to do. It wasn’t a plan where 1 said to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>myself, &quot;l’m going to sound like a horn, or l’m gonna
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>bend my notes like a horn.&quot; No, that just started to hap

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>too, cause it makes them loving, too. And it makes them
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>think about women, I think, when they hear it. So it
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>works, whatever, whatever it is. If it’s a woman’s note,
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>men will like the note because a woman’s got to feel that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>note which will make her relate to her man.

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>make ourselves and the music whole. (Some male musicians
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>have already integrated these &quot;feminine” aspects of them
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>selves and their music reflects that. Miles, Coltrane and
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Keith Jarrett are known for the construction of their solos,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>taking turns and producing peaks and valleys — multi-orgas
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>mic climaxes. One wonders if their sex life reflects this same

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>told me of his ability to experience multi-orgasms and there

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>The way women first broke the codes in music was by
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>marrying into the secret society of musicians or by being
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>blessed with a teacher who knew the power of bringing new,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>unique energy into the fold. But, for the most part, men re

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>music. Jazz has been no exception. Lil Hardin (who various
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>historians now admit was an important contributor to Louis
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Armstrong’s development and to the life of jazz) and Leora

			<pb n='74'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>son’s wife) are not thought of as major forces in their own
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>right. Leora Meoux played trumpet and was a member of Lil
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Armstrong’s band. Lil was a pianist, composer, and band
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>leader in the early ’20s and ’30s. She is probably one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>top five women in jazz history.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Yet, generally, women jazz artists were isolated— they
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>lacked contact with other female musicians and were on
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the fringes of men’s music. The absence of a network or sup

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>special dispensation when it came to women playing jazz.

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stand, woman’s role was clearly defined—she was to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>nourisher of and voyeur to the main events.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>For women who would not or could not “marry into
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the scene was pretty dismal. Women were allowed
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>into the important scenes of productivity only as sex ob
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>jects. Restricted to that realm, the female vocalists, be they
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;virginal&quot; and &quot;unattainable” or &quot;sexual animals,&quot; were
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>meant to hold women’s more general entry at bay. Standing
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>still while men fantasized their sexual pursuits, we posed no
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>threat. But moving around—improvising or fingering an
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>instrument in our hands—we were too threatening to the
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>male stronghold. So we acquired the images of virgin queen
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and drug-addicted victim, and these were paraded through
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the band and bop era as our models. An understanding of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the great art and complexity of Billie Holiday is intertwined
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>with a recognition of the limited options available to her in
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>society. I often wonder if the tragedies in conflict with her
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>genius could have been overcome if our models and images
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>for such potency had been acknowledged and known. And
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>yet, even with the exploitation, she and other artists, like
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald, Anita O’Day, Betty Carter,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and Annie Ross, transcended those negative images and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>carved a niche in the male bastion through their improvisa
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tion of compositions and their use of the voice as an
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>instrument.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>The voice is primary in the development of jazz, begin

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>vocal timbres and sonorities. The sounds of jazz can be
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>directly related to earliest African singing. The improvisa
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tional flavor of using the voice in rituals, announcements,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>delights of nature, and imitating those joys in a wide range
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of tones and textures extended to African instruments, like
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ivory horns, marimbas, thumb pianos, flutes, and multi
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>voiced drum ensembles. Women committing themselves to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>that vocal tradition, carrying the cross of improvisation and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>warding off the vampires of commercialism, sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>were able to break through the mold of woman’s image. By
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>creating their own compositions improvisationally, these
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>women first took on the responsibility of doing their own
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>thinking, creating their own structure, presenting their full
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>musicianship instead of being tools to the imaginations of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the male hierarchy.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Paradoxically, in the past, women, especially singers,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>were given special approval from male musicians for &quot;play
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>ing by ear” — intuitive as opposed to learned, &quot;professional’
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>skill. As long as we accepted that &quot;specialness,” we were
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>denied various methods of study and we remained outside
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>the arena of healthy competition within the mainstream of
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>music, keeping us from reaching a real sense of ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>and our jazz. It became a self-fulfilling prophecy. We could
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>not be &quot;real” jazz musicians since our music was only intu
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>itive and we had not learned how to speak the language.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Every movement and minority has its own language. Yet, by
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>accepting enslavement without using our own words to free
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ourselves, we allowed the dependency of &quot;specialness” to
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>keep us from experiencing a real sense of ourselves and our
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>jazz. There is a power intrinsic to the claiming of a language
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and its instrument.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Women’s strength as jazz musicians will come when we
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>allow ourselves to play as women. Ashley Montague calls us
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the superior sex—scientific findings assure us we are
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>stronger than men when it comes to endurance. I wonder if
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that would apply to how many choruses we could take on a
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>solo. Playing &quot;hard time,&quot; “swinging&quot; in a rhythm section,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>might feel to some women like inescapable bondage with
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>male energy. But being &quot;locked in the time” and &quot;smoking
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>have less to do with physical strength and more to do with
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the lack of fear. Our associating these concepts with being
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>locked into roles may scare us away from the soaring
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>aspects of being specific, and floating in time. It’s a power
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ful experience — making music with other musicians, feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the energy created by each person’s sense of the time and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>combining it in a way that makes it one pulse. Musicians
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>have got to trust each other to make that happen, and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>maybe that’s one of the reasons why women playing to-
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>gether haven’t created that sensation of orbiting into
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>another dimension by the energy of swinging. We’ve relied
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>on the men to supply that force and our trust in each other
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>hasn’t developed to create it among ourselves. As we play
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>together more often and in varied situations, what will
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>emerge is the discovery of how to make that happen. Then,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>if there is such a thing as women’s jazz, it will emerge free
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>from any stereotyped suppositions of what it should sound
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>like.
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Playing music together, like any relationship, requires a
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>lot of risk-taking— chancing that what we’ll play may not be
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>what the bass players before us played, chancing that we
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>may not get the &quot;male” sound many of us have been taught
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>to feel comfortable with. But that step has to be taken if we
			</p>
			<pb n='75'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>are to know all there is to know about each other and what
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>we really sound like. Right now all we have is what we sound
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>like with Big Strong Daddy at the helm of the rhythm sec
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>tion or what we sound like in the shadow of our husbands. If
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>we’re not as &quot;serious,” our mistakes shouldn’t be taken as
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>seriously either. But, then, what about our successes? We
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>have to risk that failure in order to grow as musicians.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>Women have only recently engaged in consciousness
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>raising dialogue with each other. That same experience in
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>music is what can allow more of us to create in that medi
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>um; we’ll have each other to talk with, to draw out our
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>uniqueness. Until now, our conversations have usually been
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>in competition for the attention of the male ear. Why don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>we explore what harmonious rapping contributes? Playing
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>together means everyone finding a spot for herself— in the
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>time especially— not playing anybody else’s time, your own
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>time but compatible with the others. As we discover more
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>facets of our selves as women, we’Il be able to connect with
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>various combinations. The person, woman, musician, as in
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>dividual entities, need to be there, each individually, before
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>the whole makes a statement. .. unless we want to imitate
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>&quot;male&quot; behavior.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>Feminism in jazz means consciousness of ourselves as

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The question to be dealt with now is why this is so, and
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the answer is NOT &quot;Because Nature intended it ever thus.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>As Michelle Zimbalist Rosaldo explains:
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Anything so general as the universal asymmetry of the sex
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>roles is likely to be the result of a constellation of different
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>factors, factors that are deeply involved in the foundation of
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>human societies. Biology may be one of these, but biology
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>becomes significant only as it is interpreted by human actors
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and associated with characteristic modes of action.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>There are three biological realities in human life which,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>through the interpretation of human actors, have become
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>significant with respect to the cross-cultural status of
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women — and which foster the maintenance of a unilateral,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>male-dominated culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The first of these realities is that the typical female life
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>cycle is far more noticeable and dramatic than that of the
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>male. Menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth are impres
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>sive events which have no correlates in the male life cycle,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and which consequently seem mysterious to the male, who
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>has long sought plausible explanations for them. For in
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>stance, menstruation is often described as the result of a
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>gashlike wound inflicted on women for various reasons, and
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the blood flow—which strangely does not kill or weaken her
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>— is invariably labeled a very powerful and generally evil
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>contaminant. “The notion that women’s sexual processes
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>are impure is worldwide and persistent; the magical fear of
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>menstrual blood is particularly intense.&quot;15 Childbirth and

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>but the cross-cultural male reaction in this case is princi
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>pally one of envy, as evidenced by such customs as couvade

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>role identification for every child is female, which is fine for
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>girls, who are expected to assume that role as adults, but
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>which causes great conflict for boys, who are forbidden the
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>female role but cannot see a clearly defined male role. This
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>conflict is at the root of brutal male initiation rites, which
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>force boys to reject the female world of their childhood,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>where women wielded so much power, in order to take up

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>included the simple appropriation by males of female roles,

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Invention of the Sacred Trumpets,” which is part of a com
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>plex ritual cycle common to a number of peoples in the
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>northern Amazon region, illustrates this point.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>It seems that the ownership of the sacred musical instru
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ments was originally in the hands of the women, who kept
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>them hidden in the forest, where they would secretly con
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>vene to play them. But they devoted so much time to play

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>fetch water. Finally the hero Kuwai forcibly took the trum

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ing them never to allow the women to get them back. And
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>so it is that women and children are forbidden to look upon

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>It is very unlikely that this myth describes a historical

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>childhood to male-dominated adulthood. It is equally un

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>formed in private, is public in nature.&quot;2s By this he means
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that music, like any other human behavior, must conform to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>societal standards in order to be intelligible to other
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>members of society. It also means that music is generally a
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>communal activity, performed with or for the benefit of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>one’s family, friends, and neighbors.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Since we have just determined that the public sphere is
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>normally reserved for the exercise of male creativity, it
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>would follow that most societies place limitations on
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women’s music-making, and this does seem to be the case.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Especially in religious settings, where the goal is for men to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>gain some measure of control over the mysteries of life (one

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>males is severely circumscribed in many cultures. Navajo
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>women are not allowed to sing at all in religious ceremonies
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>until after menopause.” Women in ancient Japan—no
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>matter how highly educated—were permitted to use only
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the &quot;lowest style” of music.” Women of the Caraja tribe of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Brazil do not sing at all, since only men fit the cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>definition of &quot;singer&quot;”28 And these are but a few examples.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>In many cultures certain instruments are restricted to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>performance by one sex or the other, but the punishment for
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>violation of the taboos by males is nowhere near as severe
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>as that suffered by women. To cite but one example:
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The musical instruments splayed by men of the South Ameri

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>children, who were forbidden to even view them. A Takuna
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>text tells how a girl broke the rules and spied upon the flutes.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>In revenge she was killed and quartered. Her flesh was after

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>The forbidden instruments invariably have sexual connota
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>tions, but the symbolism varies with different groups:

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>(round and hollow), and sometimes “phallic” (round and

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>polyphony (which appears where there is “recognition of

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Although Lomax claims that all of the correlations he
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>makes are just between “co-occurrences&quot; in a society, it is

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>core. The &quot;basic aspects of social interactions” that Lomax
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>chooses as correlates to elements of folk song style are: size

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>indulgence or rigidity in discipline. Lomax says nothing
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>about other human universals besides work—such as the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>universal male dread and insecurity regarding female
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>physiology or the universal primary socialization of young

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>realize the need for a whole new series of cantometric
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>correlations. For instance, one would want to know which
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>elements of folk song style are related to the presence and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>severity of initiation rites of both sexes, the gender of

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>menstrual taboos, etc. These &quot;aspects of social interaction
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>leave their mark on every behavior, and no doubt folk song

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>parameters, they have rarely left permanent traces of their
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>creative expressions behind them. The great loss is that even
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>when women do overcome great odds to give vent to their
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>human need for creative selt-expresson, those efforts are
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>rarely recorded or given serious attention by men.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Thus, I am suggesting that the findings of ethnomusi
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cology, and the discipline itself, reveal the influence of a
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>universal androcentric culture. The creativity of one half of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the human species has been systematically ignored and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>repressed cross-culturally. Of course, women manage to
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>function as creative beings nonetheless, and their creativity
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>has found sublime expression in quilts, lullabies, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>like. But the fact remains that we are largely ignorant of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>women’s accomplishments and of their true potential as
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>creative artists. Ethnomusicology, primarily a recording dis

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>rately as possible. This means investigating all of the music
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>created in a particular culture; searching out the subtle and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>elusive styles developed by women; notating lullabies, fu
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>neral laments, &quot;hummings, and the rhythmic pounding of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>pestles; and recognizing that these are as representative of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>’Maori” or &quot;Pueblo” music as the music made by men at
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>religious festivals. It means thinking carefully about the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>function of music in a society, its position with respect to
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the &quot;public” and &quot;private” spheres, its relation to the male
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>insecurities that contribute to the foundation of virtually
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>every known culture. In short, it means looking beyond the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>distortions imposed by androcentric perception to give
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women’s lives and activities the respectful attention which
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>they deserve, and which must be accorded if we are ever to

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>adopted a woman from outside the tribe as his daughter,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>giving her the name Psetan’non’pawin (Two White Buffalo
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Woman). The adoption was celebrated the following

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>For a chief to adopt a daughter in this fashion was
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>not unusual, particularly in a case such as that of Red
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Fox, whose own daughter had died some years earlier
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>The aspect of this event that was remarkable pertains to
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Two White Buffalo Woman herself. Born Frances Dens
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>more in 1867, this white woman had spent the previous
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>eighteen years traveling and living among Indian tribes,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>keeping a detailed diary and recording the traditions,
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>religious beliefs, and songs of her hosts.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Before beginning her study of Indian culture and
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>music, Densmore trained as a pianist at Oberlin Conser
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>vatory and with private teachers in New York. Returning
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to her hometown, Red Wing, Minnesota, she worked as a
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>piano teacher and church organist. There she became
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>acquainted with John Comfort Fillmore of the Milwaukee
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Music School, an enthusiastic advocate of Indian music
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>With Fillmore’s encouragement, the young woman
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>began to make her visits to nearby Indian encampments;
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>eventually this field work and the writings it generated
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>became a full-time occupation for her.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Densmore’s seriousness, her genuine interest in
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Indian culture, and her musical instincts were adequate

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>cant factor in Densmore’s success was the able assistance
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of her sister Margaret, who accompanied her on many of
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>her field expeditions, remembering names and faces and
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>supervising Frances’s song-recording sessions.
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>The results of Densmore’s more than half a century
				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of ethnomusicological study are formidable: over 120

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sister, has been described as a &quot;super-secret-service

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>our cultures. The one facet of our cultural expression that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>can be most exciting to us and the most useful one, I think,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>is our music. The musical traditions of most Indian nations
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>include, of course, personal and/or family songs that are the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sole property of one individual or family and are to be used
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>only by them. Very often the individual’s song is to be sung,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>finally, at that individual’s death and never again. Most
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>people can understand why these particular songs are never
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to be recorded, but they will have a hard time accepting
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>that most Indians feel that certain songs of ceremonial signi
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ficance will lose their power if recorded or written down.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Still, there are those songs that can be recorded and tran
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>scribed, and which ethnomusicologists can analyze to their
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>hearts&apos; content.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>This recording and transcribing is being done more and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>more often currently, not only by ethnomusicologists, but
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>by Indians themselves. Nearly everywhere you look at pow-
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>wows and other public celebrations, Indians are there with
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>their Sonys and Sanyos recording the music and songs that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>are an integral part of every Indian social function. Right
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>alongside the Indians, you will see tourists and an
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>occasional ethnomusicologist who is there gathering more
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>information on the music of the people.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The decision today to allow a researcher to record and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>analyze a tribe’s or an individual’s songs can be said to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>conscious decision based on an assessment of past experi
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ence. There is a description of just such a decision-making
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>process in the book Kinaaldá’ by Charlotte Johnson Frisbie.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>This book, which does a commendable job of recording a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Navajo girl’s puberty rites (kinaaldá’) in the Blessing Way,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>gives us an almost unbiased moment-by-moment account
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of every song and ritual during the entire kinaaldá’ of one
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>girl and portions of others. One faction of the family strong
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ly objects to the &quot;Hollywood” cameras and the white
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>woman asking so many questions, while the other faction
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>sees it as a good thing for the tribe and the medicine man to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>have the ceremonies ręcorded.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>These contemporary decisions are one thing, but how
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>about the decisions made by the tribes who, at the turn of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the century, allowed women like Frances Densmore access
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to their homes and ceremonies and permitted them to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>record their songs on their wax cylinders? How, besides the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>fact that the ways of whites piqued the curiosity of the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Indians, and a chance to watch one at close quarters was a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>chance too good to miss? What did the Indians think of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>these strange women who were allowed to travel among
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and work with the various tribes apparently without the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>benefit of the protection of their own families?
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Here again, we come to the idea of the “wholeness&quot; of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>things. Where individual people were concerned, any non
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>destructive behavior that deviated from the norm was not
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>only accepted, but very often had a place made for it within
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the social structure. For example, the homosexual, or
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>winkte, in Sioux society was looked upon as someone with a
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>special sensitivity and was the one to name newborn chil
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>dren. Nearly all Indian cultures had characters whose
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>visions required life as a “contrary,” that is, a life in reverse.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>A contrary would say &quot;no” for &quot;yes,&quot; wear clothing back
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>wards, enter homes backwards, ride horses backwards.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>From nation to nation the occasion for this behavior varied
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>from constant to ceremonial, but whenever it occurred, it
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>was accepted. What many people today would call deviant
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>group behavior even had its ritual outlet. Nearly everywhere
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>there were set occasions for such behavior as ritualized
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ridicule and many of the other activities that modern-day
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Indians and non-Indians are forced to suppress or keep
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>secret.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Viewed from this perspective, it seems no wonder that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>these polite, apparently harmless women with their strange
			</p>
			<pb n='87'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>paraphernalia were not only allowed to carry on their cur
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ious activities, but that very often a place was made for
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>them in the societies with which they lived and worked. In
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the long run, this acceptance has turned out for the benefit
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of the tribes involved; for, no matter how one may disagree
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>with the cultural analyses of these ethnomusicologists, the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>fact remains that those precious wax cylinders are still in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>existence and are today being catalogued and re-recorded
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>on cassette. These songs now on cassette are being returned
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to the tribes from which they came.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Nowadays, the music of Indian America is being re
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>corded on an ever-increasing number of cassettes. Because
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>these cassettes can become a fairly permanent record of a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tribe’s songs and music, we generally welcome this activity.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>What we regret is that very often these cassettes are sold
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>under copyright to commercial music interests and the

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Of the more recent written works by female ethnomusicol
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ogists, I found only one that was not under copyright. Linda
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Goodman, who did her Ph.D. research among the Makah of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Washington State, has produced a monograph Music ano
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Dance in Northwest Coast Indian Life that is not only open
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to use by anyone, but includes, as well, an insightfully
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>prepared lesson plan at the back of the pamphlet.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>There are other women doing careful research today,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and writing rather prolifically on music from many tribes all
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>across the country. Regrettably, it&apos;s all being published
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>under copyright. Somehow, to most Indians, that just
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>doesn’t balance out.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Ida Halpern, for instance, is to be applauded for her

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>documented, and consciously objective.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>The work of Claire Farrer among the Mescalero is also
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>evidence of careful research and diligence that is character

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>The most prolific of female ethnomusicologists writing
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>today is, without doubt, Gertrude Kurath. Her work spans
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>thirty years and is widely respected among ethnomusicolo
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>gists. Her work is also the most often cited in all the research
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>read.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Still, all the work is printed under copyright and contains
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>transcriptions of songs and descriptions of ceremonies
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>sacred to the people from whom they were taken. It is an
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>inescapable conclusion that something is a bit out of joint in

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>having authored some dozen songs I considered among
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>my most cherished repertoire. But as chance had it, I was

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>house in her home turf, Berkeley. My playing partner had
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>arranged to meet Malvina at the gig. Both of us were so
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>preoccupied with her imminent arrival that we kept our
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>heads trained on the door all evening, wondering if she

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Many, I suspect, never did. Malvina was often too shy to

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the rest of her days. One of her mainstays was a deep

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>brought with it the terrible frustration of being ostracized
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>by the music industry and thus not being able to reach
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the listenership she sought.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>There are many dimensions to Malvina Reynolds that
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>we will never know, but like a good working-class

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of her essence. Like any great writer, her work reveals her

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>even her very human inconsistencies. This I can say with
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>confidence: Malvina was carrying on a torrid love affair
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with the earth, whose beauty, brutality, and fragility she
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>elegied at every opportunity. She cajoled it, raged at it,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mothered it, and scrutinized it, finding hidden mystery
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>along with hidden answers. “This old world is mean and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>cruel,” she laments, then rejoins, &quot;but still I love it like a
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>fool,&quot; and she did, she did, she did. “They’ve got the world

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>noun changes. Their audience was largely women only,
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>lesbian separatists. According to Kanda Mason from
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Roadwork, a feminist production company, this was
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>necessary in order &quot;for women to create their energy and

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>have by and large been those of the mainstream male

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>women’s music festivals, the business of woman-identified
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>music took hold, with the production of high-quality
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>music as one of its main objectives. The earliest feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>albums include Mountain Moving Day (1972), Virgo Rising
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>(1973), and Lavender Jane Loves Women (1973). Except

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the albums were made by women producers. The Deadly

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and got a women’s recording company.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Their first product was a 45 featuring Meg Christian

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Distribution of these early records was usually done

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tion, a group formed in the early ’70s. Around the same
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>time that Women in Distribution folded, Ginny Berson
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and Meg Christian were touring the country to promote
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Olivia’s first 45. After each performance Berson says she
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>would stand up and ask for women interested in distri
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>buting the record. From this action a new country-wide
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>women’s distribution network began to form.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>At first, the women were urged to promote this music
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in their spare time, letting friends hear the albums in
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>their homes. Gradually a business began to form, with
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>women distributors holding territories in every state.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Their job was to get women’s music out—primarily
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>through music stores and radio stations. In March 1979,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>these distributors met in Kansas City in order to form the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Women’s Independent Label Distribution Network
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>(WILD). Their purpose was to act as a unified collective

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>group, letting their wishes be known to labels making
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>woman-identified music, and to work cooperatively with
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>each other in order to keep woman-identified music
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>alive. Since WILD’s formation, the group has begun to

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>porting distributors —which range from 20 to 30 in num
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ber—all over the country. The group puts out a news
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>letter that reports information from the record industry
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and tries to have more of a say about what gets recorded
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>-the goal being to produce both technically and artisti
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cally good albums.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Production companies have also formed in many
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>cities to promote artist tours. One of the largest of these
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>companies is Roadwork, which is devoted to spreading
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>women’s work and developing women’s culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Roadwork arranges bookings and tours for fall and
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>spring concerts throughout the country.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>All of the earliest business ventures had a great deal
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of volunteerism attached to their formation, limiting the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women involved in this work to those who could afford
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to volunteer—which usually meant middle- or upper-class
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>white women. In order to help woman-identified music
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and businesses reach the needs and talents of many
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>diverse women, feminist companies such as Roadwork
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and Olivia have made one of their main goals that of
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>reaching Third World women—women of color, Hispanic
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and Asian women. There has been a concentrated effort
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to dispel the &quot;white middle-class women’s music&quot; image
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>by including more Third World women in concerts and
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>recordings
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Another major area of concentration in this outreach
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>program is reaching those women who have not yet
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>heard of women’s music. Surprisingly many women
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>involved in organizations such as NOW, Women’s Stud
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ies programs, political feminist groups, health care, and
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>battered women’s shelters have not heard this music. For
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>example, a recent concert Meg Christian gave at the
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>National Women’s Studies Conference evoked a huge
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>response—many of the women had no knowledge
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>beforehand that music like this existed. The effort to get
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>more people to hear this music has included renting
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>larger spaces, advertising in &quot;above-ground&quot; publications,
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and producing fewer &quot;women-only” concerts
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>A major way of spreading women’s music has been
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>through two annual woman-identified music festivals:
			</p>
			<pb n='92'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the National Women’s Music Festival, run by a women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>collective at the University of Illinois (Champaign-Urbana),
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and the Michigan Women’s Music Festival. Started in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>1974, the National Women’s Music Festival brings
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women musicians together to share their work and learn
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>new musical techniques and skills from each other.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>There are music concerts day and night, with music
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>workshops and an open mike for the many women who
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>wish to perform. One can hear a variety of music—from
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>anti-nuke and other politically oriented women, Third
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>World women, radical lesbian-feminists, and classically
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>trained musicians.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In contrast to the academic setting of the National
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Women’s Music Festival, the Michigan gathering is held
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>out in the woods, where tents are set up for stages and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>living necessities (kitchen, health care, child care, etc.).
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>According to Lisa Vogel, one of the collective founders
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of this event, a goal is to provide a chance for women &quot;to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>see what it would be like to live without men.&quot; The space
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>is thus limited to women-only, and the entire four-day
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>weekend is run and operated by women. Many of the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>women who come are lesbians. The music is aimed pri
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>marily at entertaining the audience, with an emphasis on
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>popular woman-identified singers and bands, especially
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>those who do not receive a lot of above-ground exposure
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>because of their political beliefs. Workshops focus on a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>variety of women’s issues — from healing and health care
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to women’s music production and distribution to congo
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>drum playing to just plain fun. Women are required to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>help out with the work, thus keeping the admission price
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>down (which is fixed by income).
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Both festivals, as well as many other woman-identified
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>concerts, try to provide wheel-chair access, signing for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the deaf-impaired, and some sort of more-if-you-can,

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>women who are usually left out participate, and in turn
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>give others the opportunity to learn from these women.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>The extra planning and expense involved is something
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>above-ground concert producers rarely bother with.

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In the winter of 1970, I lived on the Lower East Side with
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>my three-year-old daughter. I became involved in the Libera
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tion Nursery, a sixties style cooperative school experiment,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and in community anti-war projects. Change was in the air.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Most of the people I knew were politically active; life styles
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>were being continuously questioned. Although our activities
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>against the war were not, as in the case of the Vietnamese, e
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>life and death struggle, our constant consciousness of the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ongoing horror of the war and inability to end it led to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>strong feelings of frustration with and disaffection from the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>&quot;system.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>At this time I heard of newly formed women’s conscious
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ness-raising groups in the Lower East Side area. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>raising various other questions-about the nuclear family
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>communes, monogamy, children, sexuality. They came up
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with answers that seemed to shake the foundations of past
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>assumptions. All these issues were continually on my mind.

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the time that fewer cared. I worked at the nursery once a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>week; I brought my guitar and made up songs, dances, and
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>games with the two- and three-year-olds. A friend of mine
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>invited me to play keyboard in his rock band and out of that
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>experience I began writing my own songs, trying to open
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>myself to styles in music making that seemed more in tune
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with the times. I also worked on opera productions like La
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Bohème and Cosi Fan Tutti or performed chamber-works
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>like Mozarts Piano Quartet and taught piano to make a

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>because I saw in it a way to bridge the gap between the dif

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>After some discussion we decided to call ourselves the

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>much used and much abused during that period. But I think
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>it was appropriate to our spirit. An artist friend designed the

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>through our group or were involved in concerts with us.

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>on Zubin Mehta quoted some of his disparaging comments
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>about women as orchestral performers. This set off a frenzy
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of activity in our group. We researched the number of
