				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N001'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of arte
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N002'/>and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is com
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N003'/>monly called art can have a political impact, and that in the making of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N004'/>art and of all cultural artifacts our identities as women play a distinct
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N005'/>role. We hope that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N006'/>political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the history of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N007'/>femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_11' n='N009'/>broadening of the definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N010'/>HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N011'/>also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; our fields include
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N012'/>painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N013'/>history, architecture and filmmaking. While the themes of the individual
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N014'/>issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a dif

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N016'/>as well as members of the collective. Proposals for issues may be conceiv

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N018'/>associated with the collective. Each issue will take a different visual

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N021'/>evaluation meeting will be held after the appearance of each issue
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N022'/>Topics for issues will be announced well in advance in order to collec
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N023'/>material from many sources. It is possible that satellite pamphlets and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N024'/>broadsides will be produced continuing the discussion of each centralt
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N025'/>theme. In addition, HERESIES provides training for women who work
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N026'/>editorially, in design and in production, both on-the-job and through
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N027'/>workshops.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N028'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between ou
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N029'/>lives, our arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connec
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N030'/>tions are clarified they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N031'/>between artist and audience, and to understand the relationship be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N032'/>tween art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystifica
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N033'/>tion of art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art within
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N034'/>the present system, which has often become the relationship of adver

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N036'/>because they are made by women. We are not committed to any par
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N037'/>ticular style or aesthetic, nor to the competitive mentality that pervades
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N038'/>the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_8_1_tl_41' n='N039'/>feel that in the process of this dialogue we can foster a change in the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>any revived American left will have to acknowledge the im

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Yet, at the level of theory — the attempt to come to a com

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the cruder forms the exchange has taken: on the part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>left, the question of which is really the “primary contradic
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tion” — class, race or sex—and the related question of which
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>came first—class society or male supremacy, property or
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>rape? The verdict, popular in certain left circles in the mid
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>seventies, was that class and race were so far ahead in terms
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of primacy that feminism could only be understood as a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>distraction invented by the petty bourgeoisie.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Then, of course, on the other side, some feminists have de
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>nounced the entire left as a &quot;male movement&quot; and socialisn
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>as the most advanced form of patriarchy. In the seventies

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>it’s important to acknowledge the connections between the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>there are some real contradictions between the items on the

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>two directions. On the one hand, as feminists, we are drawn

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>as a sisterhood of free women. It is this sisterhood, this col

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>women and men—fathers, lovers, brothers sons, neighbors
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>co-workers. And we know, for all our criticisms of the patriar
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>chal family, that this community of women and men is not
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>just a swamp of immanence and degradation for women.

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>kinship and thousands of shared experiences and expecta
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tions, are the ground out of which comes our sense of class

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>women, I mentally abstract myself from immediate family
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>or community ties, and focus on what I have in commor

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ourselves are true to our experience. We exist in two kinds of

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>as women in the sisterhood of women. Both are real. But we
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>do not have a feminist politics that expresses the totality of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>our experience as women—&quot;the both and the and&quot; that

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>men. In the most Jacobin, separatist versions of radical

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>from one point of view, compromised by the &quot;fleshly,

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>women. Feminist theory, again and again, points to the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>mother, either metaphorically or in person, as the source of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>our problems. She (at best, unwittingly) manufactured ou

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ostensibly most militant answer is &quot;yes”: insofar as she has
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>consorted with the enemy or, worse, conspired to reproduce
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>gender, the mother is guilty, and we must denounce her.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>This particular thrust of feminist politics is also visible
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>from outside the movement. The anti-feminist charge that
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>we are against motherhood and the family is not entirely a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>distortion, and the anti-feminist movement is not entirely a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>result of right-wing manipulation. If some women—women
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>who by all rights should be on our side—can say they fee
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>&quot;attacked&quot; by feminism, it may be because they have sensed
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the undercurrent of anti-woman anger in what is still a &quot;par
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tial feminism.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The other kind of “partial feminism&quot; is something we
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>commonly find on the left. It is a politics which readily
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>recognizes the &quot;rights of women,&quot; but, as Linda Gordon has
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>pointed out, is hostile to any collectivity of women that

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>politics that recognizes both the mother and the daughter in
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>us, both our collective identity as women and our ties to a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>class of men and women, and we need to develop this
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>politics in such a way that we do not—out of fear or
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>guilt—evade the contradictions or flatten them out.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Let me end with some questions which might point us
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>toward that next step— toward a feminist politics that is both
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>revolutionary and true to the totality of our experience as
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>women. Can we build a political community of women, or is
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sisterhood just a sentiment? There are many sub-questions
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>here, but what concerns me most right now is the narrowness
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and exclusivity that so often characterizes feminist projects
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and communities. Linda Gordon describes feminist com
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>munities today as &quot;often small, self-conscious, tense, ridden
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>with moralism and right-lineism.” I think she’s right, and we
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>have to ask how much of our anger has been directed toward
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>other women, particularly those who show any sign of &quot;com-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>plicity.&quot; We talk about universal sisterhood, but, too often in
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>practice we are horrified by a woman who wears spike heels
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>or black eye-liner or (god forbid) calls her women friends
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>girls.&quot; There is a class bias in this, but also fear. Do we have
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the strength now for a more generous and open form of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>sisterhood—one that can meet other women where they are?
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Ithink we need less &quot;theory, and more analysis. We have
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>roughly 329 theoretical syntheses of Marxism and feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>on the books and in the journals, but only the sketchiest
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>understanding of the real situation of women’s lives today
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and how they are changing. We are vaguest of all when it
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>comes to Third World women—the enormous female
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>peasantry or the growing female proletariat being created by
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>multinational corporations. If we are serious about the col
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>lectivity of women as a revolutionary force, then where is
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>our analysis of the objective factors drawing us together, or
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>separating us? Is the objective basis for sisterhood declining,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>as compared to the 19th century, or is it expanding as
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>women leave their homes and enter a sharply sex-segregated
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>labor force?
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Linda Gordon has challenged us to develop our feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>utopian vision. In some ways, we have been longer on visions
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>than we have been on analysis, but too often our &quot;visions’
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>have been exotic, spiritualist, impossible to connect with or
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>dinary women’s needs and fantasies. I think we need a vision
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>of human community which grows out of the contradictions
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>we live, one which addresses both the “mother” and the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>daughter&quot; in each of us—both our needs for collectivity
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and for independence, both our capacity for nurturance and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>for self-reliance, both our ongoing ties to men and our
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_9_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>emerging strength as a sisterhood of women.

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ONCE
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>two small girls named Edie and Ruthy were sitting on the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>stoop steps. They were talking about the real world of boys.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Because of this, they kept their skirts pulled tight around
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>their knees. A gang of boys who lived across the street spent
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>at least one hour of every Saturday afternoon pulling up
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>girls’ dresses. They needed to see the color of a girl’s under
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>pants in order to scream outside the candy store, Edie wears
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pink panties.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Ruthy said anyway she liked to play with those boys. They
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>did more things. Edie said she hated to play with them. They
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>hit and picked up her skirt. Ruthy agreed. It was wrong of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>them to do this. But, she said, they ran around the block a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lot, had races and played war on the corner. Edie said it
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>wasn’t that good.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Ruthy said, another thing: Edie, you could be a soldier if
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>you’re a boy.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>So? What&apos;s so good about that?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Well, you could fight for your country.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Edie said, I don’t want to.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>What? Edie! Ruthy was a big reader and most interesting
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>reading was about bravery—for instance Roland’s Horn at
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Roncevaux. Her father had been brave and there was often a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>lot of discussion about this at suppertime. In fact he some
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>times modestly said, yes. I suppose I was brave in those days.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>And so was your mother, he added. Then Ruthy’s mother put
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>his boiled egg in front of him where he could see it. Reading
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>about Roland, Ruthy learned that if a country wanted to last
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>it would require a great deal of bravery. She nearly cried
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>with pity when she thought of Edie and the United States of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>America.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>You don’t want to? she asked.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Why, Edie, why?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>don&apos;t feel like it.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Why, Edie? How come?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>You always start hollering if I don’t do what you tell me.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>don’t always have to say what you tell me. I can say
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>whatever I like.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Yeah, but if you love your country you have to go fight for it.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>How come you don’t want to? Even if you get killed, it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>worth it.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Edie said, I don’t want to leave my mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Your mother? You must be a baby. Your mother?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Edie pulled her skirt very tight over her knees. I don&apos;t like it

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>wanted to go away. She just wanted to jump from the top
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>step, run down to the corner and wrestle with someone. She
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>said, you know Edie, this is my stoop.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Edie didn’t budge. She leaned her chin on her knees and felt
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>sad. She was a big reader too, but she liked The Bobbsey
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Twins or Honey Bunch at the Seashore. She loved that nice
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>family life. She tried to live it in the three rooms on the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>fourth floor. Sometimes she called her father Dad, or even
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Father which surprised him. Who? he asked.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>I have to go home now, she said. My cousin Alfred’s coming.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>She looked to see if Ruthy was still mad. Suddenly she saw a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dog. Ruthy, she said, getting to her feet. There’s a dog com
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing. Ruthy turned. There was a dog about three quarters of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the way down the block between the candy store and the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>grocer’s. It was an ordinary middle-sized dog. But it was
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>coming. It didn’t stop to sniff at curbs or pee on the house
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>fronts. It just trotted steadily along the middle of the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sidewalk.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Ruthy watched him. Her heart began to thump and take up
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>too much space inside her ribs. She thought speedily: Oh! A
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dog has teeth! It’s large, hairy, strange. Nobody can say what
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>a dog is thinking. A dog is an animal. You could talk to a dog,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>but a dog couldn’t talk to you. If you said to a dog STOP!
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>a dog would just keep going. If it’s angry and bites you, you
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>might get rabies. It will take you about six weeks to die and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>you will die screaming in agony. Your stomach will turn into
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>a rock and you will have lockjaw. When they find you, your
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mouth will be paralyzed wide open in your dying scream.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Ruthy said, l’m going right now. She turned as though she&apos;d
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>been directed by some far-off switch. She pushed the hall
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>door open and got safely inside. With one hand she pressed
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the apartment bell. With the other she held the door shut.

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>can’t. Please Edie, I just can’t.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Edie’s eyes rolled fearfully toward the walking dog. It’s com

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Nol Nol said Ruthy.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The dog stopped right in front of the stoop to hear the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>screaming and banging. Edie’s heart stopped too. But in a

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>easy steady pace.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>When Ruthy’s big sister came down to call them for lunch,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the two girls were crying. They were hugging each other and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>their hair was a mess. You two are nuts, she said. If I was
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>mama, I wouldn’t let you play together so much every single

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it was Ruthy’s fiftieth birthday.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>She’d invited three friends. One of the friends was Ann a

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>about 25 times. I don’t mind. But let’s be serious. She&apos;d been
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>away for a couple of years and wanted to offer witnessing in
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>formation about several countries. Ruth was afraid she
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>would talk forever. She had planned a family birthday sup
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>per for six o’clock. She said, please Ann, just say one good
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>thing and one bad thing about each country.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Ann laughed. OK. One good thing about Chile before the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>coup: Before the last election, capitalism and socialism were
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>actually debated on radio and TV. One bad thing: The
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>people were still pretty poor and unarmed.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Ruth said, oh shit! What about the American Left? How
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>come they weren’t interested till the thing blew? There&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>more to it.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>All right, said Ann, but please l’m not finished. She spoke
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>briefly about Rhodesia, the Soviet Union and Portugal.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Aren’t you going to say a word about China? Ruth asked. l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>dying to hear you tell them about China.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Not yet, said Ann. You’ll only contradict every word I say,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Ruth.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Edie, the oldest friend was there too. She had not been listen
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing to Ann. She was remembering the two children, Ruthy
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and Edie. You know Ruth, it wasn’t exactly like that. You
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>know we both ran in and out a lot and I would have slammec
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the door on you except it was your house — and that slowed
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>me down.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>All so long ago and far away, said Louise the third friend.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>She’d also heard Ruth’s story several times. What does it
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>mean to you Ruth? She said she was getting pretty tired of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Ann’s endless discussions of far-off socialist countries. She
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>wanted to talk about the urban and rural problems of the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>United States. Political energy should now be centered in the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>neighborhoods of this city. There, women would have natu
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ral leadership and that would be the two giant steps in the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>right direction. She said, this great center looks like the aban
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>doned colony of some embarrassed imperial power.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Edie agreed. She taught in the city’s unhappy high school
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>system. When asked about her work, she said, oh, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>whole thing is hopeless. It’s hopeless. She was thinking about
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the students, the young people. Oh hopeless! She began to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>No tears! they shouted. Edie, No! No tears! They had all at
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>different times been quite fierce in the nation’s wintry face.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Though they sighed for the world’s future, they were against
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>despair.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Louise was also concerned about the grand juries which
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>were being called up by federal attorneys all over the coun
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Edie wasn’t interested. She said, theyre going through
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>something. It’Il pass.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>doubt it, said Louise. You know that woman in New Haven
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>who was called. I know her. Personally. She wouldn’t say a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>word. She’s in jail. They’re not kidding.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>l’d never open my mouth either, said Ann. Never. She
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>clamped her mouth shut then and there.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>believe you Ann, said Ruth, but suppose you were in Argen
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tina and they had your kid. God, if they had our Letty, l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>maybe say anything. (Letty was the first grandchild. When
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>she came to the door at six o’clock for the family dinner,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she’d probably think it was her own birthday party, such a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>fuss would be made over her green eyes, her curly hair, her
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>new sentences.)
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Oh Ruth, you’ve held up pretty well once or twice, said
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Louise.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Yes, said Ann, opening her mouth. In fact we were all pretty
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>good that day, we were sitting right up against the horse&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>knees at the draft board—were you there Edie? And then the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>goddam horses started to rear and the cops were knocking
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>people on their backs and heads—remember? And Ruth
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was watching—you just suddenly plowed in and out of those
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>monsters. You should have been trampled. And you grabbed
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the captain by his gold buttons and you hollered, You
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>bastard! Get your goddam cavalry out of here. You shook
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>him and shook him.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>He ordered them, said Ruth. She put her birthday cake which
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was apple pie on the table. She sat down. I saw him. He was
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the responsible person. I saw the whole damn operation. l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>begun to run away but I turned because I was the one in
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>charge; I was the one who was supposed to be there and I
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>saw him give the order. l’ve never honest to god been so
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>angry.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Ann became cheerful. Oh there’s plenty to be angry about
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>right now. Whenever she remembered an energetic action,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>she forgot her travels and her troubles and became
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lighthearted.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Ruth lit the candles. We’ve got to blow this out together, she
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>said. I haven’t got the wind I used to have.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>But you’re still full of hot air, said Edie and kissed her,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>because of time.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Will I see you all next week? asked Ann. She had wrapped
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her piece of birthday pie in foil to bring it to her mother, a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>very old lady who waited patiently for little pleasures since
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>death was so slow. Will we meet here? You have the biggest
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>kitchen Ruth.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>OK, they all said at once. Yes.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>This was because they had talked it over earlier. Even before
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Ruth told her old childhood story, they had reviewed the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>facts. They had taken it easy for a couple of years —not Edie
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>(not you Edie!)— advancing the interesting careers of middle
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>age, traveling, baking bread, taking long walks with their
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>grown-up children. They criticized themselves for this. Now,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>they decided it was about time to gather once again with
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>others. They wanted to go forth with fear and rage (as they
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>had when young) to save the world. Or at least, said Louise,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>sticking to her analysis, the famous, decaying city which was
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>their home.

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>theories of role modeling tend to focus

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and feminists characterize this strength
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>in a variety of ways, but both tend to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>equate strength with a lack of ambigui

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>(or normal or autonomous) woman. As
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>girls, we may have a hard time finding
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>an acceptable and satisfactory version
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of womanhood, but once we make the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>transition, we become guiding stars for
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>others who also want to be adequate
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>women. The logic of modeling seems
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to demand a lack of ambiguity: model
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ing is implicitly a form of teaching
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>(although not necessarily purposeful
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>teaching), and teaching requires a fairly

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>adults reinforces the notion that mod

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>figures. From this point of view, women

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>strategy almost always links heroism to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>work and sees collective struggle

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>This situation creates a dilemma for

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>seems unlikely that women workers

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>heroes are cut down to life-size.

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>character. It is also frequently under
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>mined by various forms of debunking,

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and thus in our own. This flattening fre
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>quently gains support from certain
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>false assumptions about human nature,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>which, in turn, are used to justify

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>logical violence. The first assumption is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that we only admire people for their
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>perfection and consistency, and that,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>therefore, we should suppress the less

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The second assumption is that we can
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>not tolerate much inner conflict; thus,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>we should be encouraged to disown or

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>These assumptions essentially view
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>people as children in the derogatory

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and as unworthy of full respect. Since

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>The problem remains, then: How can

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>women? In part, the women’s move-

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>variety of women. A further task is
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>biographical. We must show how our
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lives have been (and are) historically
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>situated, and how we can deal with the

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The following selections are from Judith Malina’s un
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>published Brazilian Diaries (1970-71)
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>In 1947 Malina co-founded the Living Theatre with Julian
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Beck. Early productions included Jack Celber’s The Con
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>nection and Bertolt Brecht’s In the Jungle of the Cities and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Man Is Man. In 1963, to close the Living Theatre, the IRS
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>brought charges of tax evasion. After serving prison terms,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Malina and Beck joined their company in Europe, where
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>they collectively created four new works: Mysteries and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Smaller Pieces, Frankenstein, Paradise Now and Malina&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>version of Brecht’s Antigone.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>In 1970 the Living Theatre went to Brazil, where they
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>began to work on a cycle of plays called “The Legacy of
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Cain,&quot; to be performed for and with the poor in streets; at
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>factory gates; in schools, hospitals and insane asylums; on
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>picket lines. In 1964 the democratic government of Brazil
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>had been toppled by a military coup. In the decade before,
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>rapid economic expansion (basically due to enforced low
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wages and the resultant high profit) had led to inflation and
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>unrest. A last-ditch effort to appease the working class with
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sweeping public programs aroused middle- and upper-class
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>fears — paving the way for the military coup. By the time
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the Living Theatre arrived, public officials had been driven
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>into exile. Elections had been repeatedly cancelled; in
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>those held, all the candidates were generals and only
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>generals could vote. Opposition press and university pro
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>fessors were harassed, arrested, tortured— and they disap

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>suspected dissidents. Small bands of urban guerillas were
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the only organized opposition, and their actions only inten
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sified the repression.
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The Living Theatre’s work in the slums of Brazil led to
				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>their arrest by the police. This time the charges were

				<lb facs='#facs_20_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and other Living Theatre members served three-month

				<lb facs='#facs_23_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>with the tolling of bells. The dreamer and the mother are

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Kom society was agricultural, and the Kom women were

				<lb facs='#facs_25_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>two events, in July 1958, combined to trigger outright revolt.

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>handbooks. Ariadne’s projects fall into two categories: (1)

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>campaign.&quot; The first is a one-time event designed specifical

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>three-week period. In Three Weeks in May, for instance, the

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>City Hall Mall. Rapes were recorded daily, as they were

				<lb facs='#facs_30_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Such a campaign builds public interest; it educates and

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>(For example, 18th- and 19th-century American posters show blond young white women being attacked by

				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>place to gain experience and is more accessible than the major commercial networks.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>6 USE EXISTING MEDIA FORMS in which women can speak out on issues —talkshows, radio interviews,
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women’s columns. Use the alternative media systems. Create educational packets for schools, univer
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sities and community organizations. Slideshows, videotapes and even performances can find receptive
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>audiences all over your community.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>7 DOCUMENT YOUR ACTIONS with slides, photos, film or video so you can show issues and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>methodologies to other media-action groups. Some museums and cable stations provide free or low-
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>cost public access to equipment. If there is no one in your group who can handle film or video, make
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>contacts with a university broadcasting department, where there are often women who welcome a connection
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>with a broader political network.
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>8 BEGIN TO PLAN THE ACTUAL EVENT OR CAMPAIGN. First, answer these questions: Have we chosen
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>an issue that is currently being heavily publicized in the media? What do we want to say about it? Can
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>we say it in language a broad audience will understand? Are our political goals appropriate to the ac
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tion? What media form is our target? Is it best suited to our event? How much will it cost? What are our
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>resources? Where can we raise funds? How can we expand participation to include women from the media
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>politics and art? Will it be a one-time “media performance&quot;” or a “public informational campaign”? When and
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>where should it take place? Is the setting right? Time of day? What are the images we want to project?
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>9 SELECT THE KEY IMAGES AND MESSAGE in the coordinating committee of your group. At least one
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>member should be an artist who can facilitate, design a format and create the visual images. Hold
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>brainstorming sessions to come up with images that will accurately express the direct political and the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>more personal content. Your first images will probably reflect clichés we’ve all accumulated from popular
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>culture. Keep exploring your consciousness until strong and original images begin to form that will profoundly
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>affect your audience. If you need a push, look at mythological images of women in books. Find the ones that
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>represent positive symbols for women, even though they may have acquired negative connotations in this
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>culture, and research them thoroughly. These are the images we need to reclaim, to transform their meaning
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>(For instance, in In Mourning and in Rage, we took the images of women as mourners, trivialized in this
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>culture, and transformed them into powerful seven-foot tall figures demanding an end to violence against
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women. In another event, produced by the staff of the Woman’s Building in Los Angeles, Kate Millett’s sculpture
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Naked Lady —an image celebrating strength, women of large dimensions Jeven fat)—was raised to the roof of the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Woman’s Building and placed over the entrance as a protective and threatening goddess. Ariadne also designed a
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>float for the “Take Back the Night“ march in San Francisco [part of the 1978 Feminist National Conference on
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Pornography). A richly dressed Madonna on the front side became, on the back side, the carcass of a lamb, spew
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ing out pornographic images from Christian religious rituals, Creek mythology and medieval lore. The float
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>visualized the split between the virgin and the whore, or the good girl/bad girl dichotomy we believe to be at the
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>cultural roots of contemporary pornography.)
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>10 BE SURE YOU DO NOT MERELY CREATE A MEDIA GIMMICK. Superficial images that don’t go deep
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>into the cultural symbols of a society have less impact. Remember that by distributing your images
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>through the mass media you are competing with sophisticated image-makers and with high-impact im
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ages-namely, those of women being attacked and violated. News media people react negatively to gimmicks
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>or cute tricks designed to entertain and obtain coverage. The media can choose to manipulate, but they don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>like to be manipulated. Gimmicks do not transform consciousness, and the ultimate goal of our actions is such
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>à transformation. Events designed to express gut-level feelings and real community concerns do not come
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>across as manipulative. A large amount of obvious preparation for an event is a sign of its seriousness. Par
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>ticipants in the action will experience a sense of collective and political expression. When this is com
				<lb facs='#facs_31_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>municated, the media will keep coming out, and your audience will grow

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>11 CONTROL THE MEDIA’S INTERPRETATION of your images and information. The press release, the first
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>step in informing the media of your plans, frames perception of your action. It is an art form in itself. It
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>must be written simply, with enticing descriptions of the visuals and a clear political perspective on the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>issue addressed. It should include names of participating government officials and celebrities and must give
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the impression that your action is the most important event of the day.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>(For example, the press release headline for the hoisting of The Naked Lady at the Woman’s Building read:
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;The Naked Lady of L.A. Takes on a New Image.” The contrast between the stereotypical image of a naked
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>woman and our sculpture was so extreme that the event was covered by major network TV news and made the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>front page of the L.A. Times. This was a real coup for media action in Los Angeles.)
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In a longer-lasting public informational campaign, the strategy is somewhat different. You need more
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>detailed information — a press kit containing a general description, a schedule of events, press releases for each
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>event and several photos. This information packet is sent out to contacts in the media, government and com
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>munity six weeks before the project begins, providing material for feature articles. Separate press releases are
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sent out several days before each individual event to TV news desks, radio and newspapers. To ensure
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>coverage, phone calls should be made on the day of an important action. If coverage is still not confirmed, ask
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to speak to the station manager. Persist until you know at least two news teams are coming out. If they don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>show up, reconsider your strategy, then make complaints to stations by phone or letter.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>12 TIMING IS VERY IMPORTANT in controlling the effectiveness of your action. It is infinitely easier to get
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>coverage for a one-time event if it takes place at a time when the public is being consistently exposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>an issue concerning women. This almost always guarantees full coverage with little effort.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>(In Mourning and in Rage took place during the Hillside Strangler rape/murders in L.A. The media&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dramatization of the murders ensured coverage of our memorial performance by newscasters all over the coun

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>highly sensationalized coverage of the murders.)
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The day of the week and the time of day are also important. In Los Angeles, early on a Tuesday or
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Wednesday is considered to be the best time to call an event or press conference. Weekend news has already
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>broken and there is a better chance of getting on the evening news that same day. If you &quot;study your opposi

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>by a participating artist. The desolate area created an ominous atmosphere that contrasted dramatically with the

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>reporters are, how much time is allotted to women’s issues and—most important— how they edit their
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>news footage. How long is the average news slot? Does the newscaster stand in front of the image in a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>narrative format? What is the ratio of verbal to visual information? The success of media actions is determined

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>events are designed in the format of a newscast in order to control its coverage as much as possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Keep several essential points in mind: The event shouldn’t last longer than 20 minutes and it should have
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>at least one high-impact visual image that is emblematic of your message. Both words and images should be in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>easily understood language. Anything ambiguous must be clarified by a speech in the performance or by the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>press release. The performance should be confined to a limited area so that the camera can frame the whole set
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>without losing information. Its sequences should be broken down into eight to ten parts composed of elements
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>containing enough information so that the whole message is clear in each sequence. Parts of it can and shoulc
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>be repeated like choruses. It is okay to make small mistakes, as they will be edited out by the news anyway
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Make sure at least one speaker represents a feminist viewpoint. Her speech should be planned as an integral
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>part of the event’s structure so it is sure to be included in the newscast.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>15 THE ACTION SHOULD HAVE TWO DIRECTORS: one for the performance and the other for the media
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>-* )Since the performers in these events are usually not professional actresses, but concerned women, the
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>director should be an artist who can supportively guide them through the entire piece. The media direc

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>fand well prepared to present your point of view. In the public informational campaigns, talkshows,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>radio interviews and news features are an important part of the strategy. Moderators have many ways of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>steering a dialogue in their own direction. Your representative must also know how to control the situation. The
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>best approach is to ask the moderator before the show what questions will be discussed and to prepare your
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>answers. Prepare for negative as well as positive situations. Know what you want to say and say it. Turn every
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>question to your advantage by knowing exactly what it is you want the public to know.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The feminist perspective is rarely aired and it is crucial to talk to the millions of isolated women
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>watching in their homes in a language they will understand. Speaking publicly out of your experience as a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>woman is a very courageous act, and the women who do it need emotional support from the whole group. It is a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>good idea to go in pairs to these situations. Allow as many women as are willing to do these public interviews.

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>panels and even meetings. It not only suggests a merger of

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>suggests that speaking is the best way we know to get the

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>written word. Though more easily forgotten in its specifics, it
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>is more easily absorbed psychologically. The spoken word is
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>connected with the things most people focus on almost ex

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>advocate; then it became a relative, then a woman friend
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>then a woman &quot;who delights in idle talk,&quot; &quot;groundless
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>rumor” and &quot;tattle.&quot; Now it means malicious and unfounded
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tales told by women about other people. All this happened
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>through the increased power of patriarchal propaganda,
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>through men gossiping about women and about each other
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>on a grand scale (history). Thus, in the old sense, spoken pro
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>paganda, or gossip, means relating—a feminized style of

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>they translate badly back and forth. For instance, you can

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>through the presentation of an academic “paper” spoken
				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>from a podium. Or you can imitate speaking by writing, as

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>favored by many newspaper columnists. The best way of

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>also has a matronizing aspect. I was taken aback at a recent

				<lb facs='#facs_39_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Marxist terminology. Her point was that this terminology had

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for as long as it holds up. But when it begins not to fit,
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>we re-examine the pattern, correct it, refine it—if it is
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>salvageable. Mystification of theory prevents its organie

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>hold. It will not have taken into account powerful forces that

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>pain and loss as punishment for breaking law. It marks in

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in a profound way. The woman and the man, their clumsy

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>unbearable knowledge; they must justify themselves. They

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The main problem is that both the art establishment and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the feminist community approach feminism as an aesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>or a style. But feminism is not an aesthetic. It is the political
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>analysis of the experience of being woman in patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>culture. This analysis becomes a state of mind, a way of be
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ing and thinking when it is reflected in one&apos;s life. It can be ar
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ticulated in art, and the art itself can in turn contribute to the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>process of analysis and consciousness. If art and life are con
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>nected, and if one is a feminist, then one must be a feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>artist—that is, one must make art that reflects a politica
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>consciousness of what it means to be a woman in patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>culture. The visual form this consciousness takes varies from
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>artist to artist
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Thus art and feminism are not totally separate, nor are
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>they the same thing. If this is not understood, if we view
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>feminist art as an aesthetic represented by one correct style
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>then anything unexpected or unfamiliar is excluded. Art not
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>derived from the white middle class is excluded. Radical new
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>forms are excluded. The history of the patriarchal art worlo

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The male-dominated art establishment has a need to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>qualify feminist art as just another style. I heard one well
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>meaning male critic, Carter Ratcliff, refer to it as “the avant

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>he reduced it to the latest development in a linear progres

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and subverted, resold and dismissed as &quot;past art move
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ments.” This attitude also implies that those women who
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>are &quot;good artists” will outgrow their feminist phase.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>In 1976, Lawrence Alloway made a similar statement in his

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>for.? At the same time that he criticized feminist artists for
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the discrepancy between their work and his theory, he at
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tacked those very women who were out there actively
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>creating work and developing theory. Since in his eyes no
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>one woman’s ideas were comprehensive enough to stand for
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the whole movement, he discredited them all. In fact he saw
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the richness of diverse philosophies and aesthetics as divi
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sionary rather than as the basis of feminism itself. In the

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>social and political communities. For instance, in our desire
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to dissolve hierarchies, we have been quick to develop the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>unspoken belief that collective means better, and many
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>women fail to validate individual expression. But I think it is
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>important to see that even collective art comes in many
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>forms: a performance piece conceived and directed with in

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>can be supported and connected. However, when this does
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>not happen, we find ourselves pressured to choose between

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>to, if they aid expression, give layers of meaning to our work,
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and create a context for communication. But if we set out to

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>feminist art, we are only making something without sub
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>stance, without passion, without presence. Likewise, if we as

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>not fit into narrow definitions, we are just repeating what the

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>enough. We deserve better, and we owe it to each other to

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>just as it is not okay in the name of art. Honest criticism goes

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>As feminists, we can participate in the development of a

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>content. We can help each other to say what we want to say
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>in the clearest, most effective way. That done, we can then
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>hold ourselves accountable for the work—for what it is
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>about and how it affects women
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>An honest criticism would bring art and politics together
				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>helping us to understand their relationship, and furthering

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Elena’s house is a typical Cuban bohio, with walls made of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>palm tree planks and ceilings of palm leaves skillfully woven
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and supported by hardwood tree trunks. The living room, kit

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>stead of doors they have curtains, which provide little
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>privacy but allow air to circulate so that the bohío is cool
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and comfortable in the warm Cuban afternoons. The kitchen
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>opens onto a large patio with a wooden trough for washing
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>clothes in the shade of a sprawling tree. Ducks, turkeys and
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>chickens raise a constant chorus as they waddle and rush
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>under the large mango, orange, lemon, guava and coconut
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>trees. Somewhat further off, amid the high grass near the olc

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>rough, unpainted boards.
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Only the front of the bohio has recently received a coat of
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>paint, a bright blue. The rest, weatherworn, is quite unlike
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the cheerful facade — a contrast common in the cities as well
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>as among the peasants. “The facade is important, the rest
				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>can get by if there is no alternative,” the Cubans say. A little

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>The wood furniture is old, but painted in brilliant colors

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>The coffee is served Cuban style, in little cups, black and

				<lb facs='#facs_51_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>smiling only when something amusing occurs. The men

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>we go there in a wagon pulled by the tractor. What a time we
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>have! You know we have a budget for sports and recreation
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>with which we pay for the gasoline, the salary of the musi

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>time to get bored. And I haven’t even talked about those

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N001'/>Guwatsi,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>I am writing this because an amazing young woman from, of all places, New York City suggested I do so. I feel a bit
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>foolish trying to tell you what writing is about, what problems you will face, and how difficult it is to develop
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>an audience that can understand what you are doing. Yet I agree that it is a good idea to do so, and I hope
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>you will understand that I speak as your mother or one of your aunts (who I just might be, after all) and that
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>I&apos;d just like to acquaint you with what being a writer and a Laguna is about.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>As soon as you begin to write and let others know you are doing so, you&apos;ll start receiving a lot of flak.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>This will come from every side; the folks at home will say that you&apos;re lazy, that you&apos;re wasting your time, that
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>you mustn&apos;t write about things connected with Laguna, that you&apos;re giving bad impressions to outsiders, that
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you ought to concentrate on important things like making tamales and getting a &quot;useful&quot; education so you
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>can serve your people as a lawyer, teacher, social service worker or health care professional.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>If you&apos;re like many of us, these comments will be very painful. What importance is a poem, after all, 
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>compared to all the things people need? What good is a poem going to do a suicidal nine-year-old? How is it
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>going to meet the medical needs of the old people? How can one painting cure an alcoholic relative? Then,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>too, how can you write about the things you are doing, the things you remember, the dances, feasts, &quot;goings
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>on&quot; around Laguna, when the folks around you feel that to do so is to violate sacred things, or to present bad
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N017'/>images of them?
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>I do not honestly know the answers to these questions, though I have spent long agonized hours trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>come up with answers that would satisfy me. All I can say about this is that if you are a poet or an artist, if
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>you are a storyteller, these questions will not stop you. For an artist, a poet, will do her work regardless of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>how people feel about it, regardless of what they say. She might do it crying the while, but she will do it. And
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>it is important work. We have always given our children things from the world of imagination, of the earth, of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>human values. That is the most important part of our long heritage, I think. And those of us who create are
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>only following the example of Spider Woman, she who creates through the power of thought. Maybe thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N025'/>about this will make it better for you.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>Another trial you might experience is the way non-Indians will respond to your work. For the most part
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>teachers and other writers and artists will find much that you do incomprehensible. The closer you keep to
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>your true vision, the less likely they will be to understand it. You might find yourself trying to do like they do,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to write the kind of poems they write, to do the kind of art they do, to please them. If you do try, you&apos;ll prob
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ably learn a lot about your own work. But don&apos;t expect to sound like them. You can&apos;t. Either you will quit
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>writing or working on your art, or you will come to a time when you&apos;ll understand that either you have to do
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>it your way or not at all and will choose to do it your way. That&apos;s when you&apos;ll know you&apos;re &quot;hooked,&quot; that 
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>you really are a poet/artist, regardless of what anyone says. You may be an unpublished poet and an unshown
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>artist, but that&apos;s not as important as what you are doing in your work.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N035'/>People will say really strange things to you; they will get upset if you&apos;re not &quot;Indian&quot; enough (as they see
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>it) or will wonder how you manage to live away from the reservation if you find yourself in places like Albu
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>querque, San Francisco and New York. They will tend to relate more to your exotic qualities (as they see
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>them) and to ignore the importance of what you are doing. This can also be very painful. Lagunas are raised to
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N039'/>be very conscious of the opinions of others.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N040'/>I remember one time when I was very small and we were at Feast, something happened that upset me. I 
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N041'/>don&apos;t remember what it was, but I think the older children wouldn&apos;t let me play with them or something. 
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Anyway, I remember my great grandmother pinching me hard and saying, &quot;Don&apos;t let them see you cry. Don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>let them know.&quot; It was years before I recovered that memory, and I know that it had and still has an enor
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>mous impact on me. At the same time I was taught to hide my upset, I somehow picked up the idea that it
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>was important to keep others from being upset with me. Not all Lagunas feel this way, of course, but most of
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>us do. Watch people around you for awhile; I think you&apos;ll see what I mean. This is a long-standing attitude
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>that goes back a very long way. It is expressed in day-to-day exchanges, in formal greetings, in mealtime man
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ners, in countless small ways that we don&apos;t really notice but that have an indelible effect on us.

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>have misrepresented my position. In fact, their almost

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>confused with a similarity of outlook. They were so unalike
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in their approaches to their common experience— and I am
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>so deeply involved in the issues with which they were grap

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>equally or to present them objectively.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Take, for example, my first sentence: &quot;Two women were
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>friends, then they quarreled over politics.” Neither Jean nor

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>would have said that her friend Jean had simply become im

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>somewhere. Or this is how half of her, the rational, injured
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>half, would have explained it. The guilt-ridden, remorseful
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>half would have retorted sarcastically, &quot;Yes, she got to be
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>too much trouble, so you ditched her. You didn’t want to be
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>bothered.&quot; To be fair, most of Amanda’s friends would have
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>corroborated the first explanation; they too found Jean, or
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>rather her politics (but it became increasingly difficult to
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>separate Jean from her politics; this was part of the

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Jean’s view, corroborated by her friends, was closer to the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>second explanation: she had been ditched. After all, Amanda
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>was the one who had come out with, I don’t think we have

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>politics of her Organization, since their current line had been

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>political cowardice: perhaps she ought to have been strong
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>enough to continue to subject her every opinion and motive

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>their friendship had been based on &quot;understanding,&quot; on long

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in which the fifties were not perceived as particularly bleak

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Of course you are curious about the precise content of the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>political disagreement which developed. I have, however,
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>decided against going into the gory, sectarian details. For
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>one thing, Jean’s Organization changed its analysis several
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>times, and to follow this development would be extremely
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>tedious. For another, it was precisely Amanda’s problem that
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>she could never care really deeply about the particulars of a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>given &quot;line”; her clash with Jean was not, in essence, one of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>belief versus belief, but of belief vesus skepticism
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Still, it may prove instructive to describe a policy shift
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>which took place several months after Jean’s formal recep
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>tion into the Organization (an event she jokingly referred to
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>as &quot;taking the veil&quot;). This development, which at first
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>cheered Amanda because it seemed to belie the Organiza
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tion’s reputation for rigidity and dogmatism, later alarmed
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>her. The salutary spring-cleaning was, so far as she could tell
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>from Jean’s reports, turning into a bit of a purge. They had
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>all, Jean revealed, been opportunist and worse. It now ap
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>peared that most of their work to date had been completely
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>worthless, if not downright counterproductive. Only a
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>thorough renovation of their analysis, a radical overhaul of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>their methods, a ruthless elimination of members who re
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>mained entrenched in the old positions, would enable them
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>to move forward.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Heads rolled, but—somewhat to Amanda’s surprise — the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Organization pulled through, and Jean with it. True, there

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>terms to be dictated. She resolved to avoid such predic
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>aments; from now on she would discuss Jean’s pólitics only
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in one-to-one situations with Jean
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>It did not occur to her that she and Jean might stop
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>discussing politics. For what, then, would they talk about?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Amanda could see for herself that Jean had less and less of a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>personal&quot; life.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Jean reminded Amanda of a woman who claims she&apos;s get
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ting married merely in order to furnish her apartment with
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the wedding presents, then becomes hopelessly enmeshed in
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>her wifely role. Gone were the reservations and questions of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>which Jean had spoken at the time she “took the veil” (an ex
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pression she did not use anymore). There was no criticism of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>her Organization to which she did not have an instant rebut
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tal, whether in the form of a defense or a shouldering of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>blame which somehow served to encompass and neutralize
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the criticism.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Amanda thought of her old friend Jean: demonstrating fif
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>ties dance styles in a bar; painting in the morning, paint al
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>over her tennis shoes, light streaming in through the dusty
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>windows of the loft she had long since left for a collective
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>house; waiting out a heat wave in hothing but her ragged
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>underpants, a beer in her hand; telling funny horror stories
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>about her Catholic education. That was the real Jean, no
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>this chain-smoking politico who saw &quot;agents” everywhere
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and refused to discuss anything on the phone; who spent her
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>days silk-screening posters and her nights attending
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>meetings; and for whom the shit was, always, &quot;finally hitting
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>the fan,&quot; the contradictions “heightening&quot; or &quot;intensifying.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>This new Jean talked too fast.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>&quot;Does Jean take speed?” someone asked quite seriously
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>one day
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>&quot;No, she’s just high on History,” Amanda replied cynic
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ally
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Their encounters now took on an unvarying pattern: Jean
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>would describe her political activities, interlarding the ac
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>count with generous fragments of political theory. Amanda
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>would respond with questions, criticisms or agreement
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Amanda was at this time becoming “more political”; that is
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>to say that she more often knew what she thought, began to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>break out of her old habit of wallowing in helpless admira
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>tion of lives she considered more radical than her own. Now
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>that she allowed herself to investigate her opinion of Jean&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Organization, she realized that she had simultaneously nur
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>tured two contradictory views of it: that it was a collection
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>of heroically dedicated, morally superior individuals (this
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>though she of course knew with what withering contempt
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>morality” is regarded on the Left); that it was a gang o
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>fanatics wearing blinders and driven by complicated needs
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>including deeply painful guilt and a lust for power. Perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>there was something in each of these views, but could she
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>sustain both?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>And why did it matter so much? Why couldn’t she just
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>dismiss this particular craziness in the same way she woulc
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>have done had Jean become a Hare Krishna or Moonie? She
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>knew people with friends who had done such things, and she
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>knew what their responses had been. They had cut their
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>losses.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Amanda felt sure that this struggle (Jean’s word, she knew,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>but she meant it a bit differently) had been going on almost
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>forever, the form identical and only the content shifting with
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the times. At a period when religion had been impossible to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ignore, she, Amanda, would have been the one tormented by
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>doubt, by the example of Jean’s belief. (Jean, on the other
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>hand, was clearly the type to have burned for her too
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>intense, heretical devotion.) During the thirties Jean would
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>have joined the CP while Amanda remained the fellow
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>traveler. Or Amanda would have joined briefly, leaving at
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the time of the Nazi-Soviet pact while Jean only redoubled
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>her dedication. None of this was original. They might have
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>been crude figures counterposed in some dreadful Herman
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Hesse novel—except that Hesse, of course, wrote about
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>men.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Well, she is the Catholic, I the Protestant, Amanda
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>thought. Her liberal parents, for whom “prejudice&quot;” was a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cardinal sin, had instilled in her the WASP’s usual con
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sciousness of superiority to Catholics. If she closed her eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>she could still see the copy of American Freedom and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Catholic Power prominently displayed on their bookshelf.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>What if she is right? Amanda would think. The question
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>had the dizzy fascination of a view from an open fifteenth
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>story window. They could not both be right. Am I saved? is
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>really what she meant. But, consciously or not, she had
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>already made up her mind. It was only a matter of time
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>before she would precipitate the fatal conversation, come
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>out with the famous words, &quot;I don’t think we have anything
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>productive to say to each other right now.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; Jean replied when the time came,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sullen, unsurprised, lighting another cigarette.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Amanda did not protest. She had accepted that in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>be free she would have to take on the role of heavy. She
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>even enjoyed the dramatic moment in which she got up and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>walked away from Jean’s objections. Partly this was sadistic
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>pleasure; after all the difficulty, there was some satisfaction
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>in having hurt Jean. Partly it was relief: Jean was not omnipo
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tent, then. Within their relationship her power was great; she
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>set the terms. But Amanda had the ultimate power. She
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>could walk away.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Or so she thought; and for a while she enjoyed her vaca
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>tion from the complications of Jean. Certainly she felt
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>somehow diminished in her range of possibilities; she would
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>never, for instance, be able to call herself a revolutionary.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>On the other hand, she was beginning to feel better about
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the issue-oriented political work she was doing. And she had
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>plenty of friends; she did not need Jean. Life was so much
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>simpler now that she had &quot;given Jean up,&quot; which was how
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>she came to think of it, as though Jean were some
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>pleasurable vice: cigars, or an expensive country house.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>But the thing was that she had not really renounced Jean.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Because she remained on the Organization’s mailing list, she
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>was able to keep up with its —Jean’s — political development
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>by reading through the ten or fifteen points of unity in
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>evitably printed in miniscule type on both sides of the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>leaflets that flooded her mailbox. And since the Organiza
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>tion was active in the neighborhood, the walls of abandoned
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>buildings and boarded-up storefronts were always plastered
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>with posters—designed, naturally, by Jean—advertising
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>their forums and demonstrations
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Amanda went away for a month in the summer; when she
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>came back her mailbox was full of propaganda, the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>storefronts covered with fresh posters. She remembered
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>guiltily that Jean never took vacations. Amanda went to a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>movie she considered frivolous and encountered several of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>Jean’s &quot;comrades” in the lobby. She promptly experienced a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>ludicrous sense of relief, as though she had received permis
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>sion to be there.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>Amanda’s obsession was shared by some of her friends.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>Small conclaves devoted hours to discussing, criticizing, and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>complaining about the Organization, which was, everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>agreed, misguided, crazy, divisive, dangerous, and above all
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_73' n='N073'/>irrelevant. Prediction, often disguised as grim humor, was a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_74' n='N074'/>favorite pastime at these gatherings.

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>All this was pleasurable, the scratching of a chronic itch,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>but it represented only one aspect of Amanda’s ongoing rela
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tionship with Jean. Another was the way in which Amanda
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>had begun to search for Jean’s characteristics in other
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>women she met. And then there were the dreams
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>These dreams were deeply satisfying, some even sexually
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>so, which was odd since Amanda had always thought herself
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>uninterested in being Jean’s lover. But the sexual dreams
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>were not more important than the others, the ones in which
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>there was danger, the city toppling all around, an at
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>mosphere of terror straight out of The Battle of Algiers; the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ones in which Jean, although dressed in contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>clothing, was undoubtedly a nun, martyr or religious hermit,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the ones in which everything seemed quite normal, they

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>change, some important secret was to be revealed. There
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was even one dream in which Amanda came up behind Jean
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>as she stood in front of an easel, painting; she stepped aside
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to reveal a great, vibrant design which, Amanda realized
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>upon waking, could only be described as a mandala. She
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>laughed at herself; she did not approve of Jung. But she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>found herself waiting to dream this dream over again.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>In all these dreams, even the sexual ones, Jean was in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>some way teacher, mentor. There was a hint of sternness, a
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>whiff of reproach, but also the promise of forgiveness, ab

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Amanda began to get phone calls sweetly pressuring her to
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>attend this or that demonstration. Smug as Jesus freaks on

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>ment.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Still, she could never be sure of her freedom unless she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>were willing truly to divest herself of Jean. In order to ac
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>complish this, she decided to put Jean into a story, a strategy
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>she had, without knowing it, been saving, saying she did not
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>want to be disloyal.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>It worked. She stopped having the dreams. She experienc
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>ed a bitter sense of triumph, as though, after long planning,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>she had executed the perfect crime. But when she saw the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>magazine in which her story eventually appeared, she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>understood that what she had written was nothing other than
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>a long love letter to Jean, an explanation and self
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>justification, a plea for understanding and forgiveness.

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>This story has, it seems to me, at least three possible (and
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>plausible) endings. Please be assured that my decision to of
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>fer you your choice among them has nothing to do with the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>hackneyed tricks of certain &quot;experimental” writers. Rather,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>it is due to the fact that, as l&apos;indicated earlier, I am more in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>volved than I ought to be with this subject matter, and am
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>therefore incapable of exercising proper authorial control.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In the first ending, Amanda’s joking prediction of an ex
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tremist direction for Jean’s Organization is proved correct.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>After many months of strenuous &quot;outreach” work, mostly
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>unsuccessful, several members initiate a criticism-self
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>criticism campaign. A scrutiny of past practice reveals errors
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>so serious that the validity of the Organization’s existence is
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>once more cast into doubt. At the same time, the country is
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>moving rapidly to the right. Clearly, it seems, a change in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>methods is called for.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>One by one, Jean’s cohorts drop out of sight. Months go
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>by; then there is a rash of bombings at selected targets
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>throughout the city. The bombs having been timed to go off
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>at night, there are no injuries except for one security guard,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>who is killed instantly. In their note claiming credit for the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>explosion, the Organization places the blame for this death
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>unequivocally on the shoulders of the government and the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>multinational corporations. About a year after the last of the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>bombings, Jean is apprehended in a large Midwestern in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>dustrial city.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Of course Amanda works on her defense committee. The
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>positions of real responsibility are reserved for those who are
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>close to Jean politically, but there’s plenty of shitwork left
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>for everyone else. Amanda makes a lot of phone calls, posts
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>a lot of leaflets. She is never to know for sure whether Jean
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>was directly involved in either the planning or execution of
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the bombings. Not that it matters.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Jean is magnificent. She takes a principled stand, insisting
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that her defense emphasize the criminality of the govern
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ment and the illegitimacy of the institutions which had been
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>targeted, rather than focusing on technicalities. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>barred at the trial from reading her own prepared statement,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>her presence is itself a statement. Her thinness, her pallor,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>her hair cropped close to remove the remants of bleach from
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>her year underground, all somehow underline not
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>vulnerability, but strength. She looks like she’s sure, like she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>knows, Amanda thinks. Like Joan of Arc at the stake. The
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>characterization is admiring, not sarcastic.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The government’s case is weak, so Jean ends up doing
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>time at a minimum-security facility where repressive
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>tolerance is the order of the day. From breakfast to dinner
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the inmates are free to wander around corridors painted in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>dingy pastels. There is a &quot;beauty salon” where they spend
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>hours doing each other’s hair and nails. They watch a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>television.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>It is like high school, Jean says, when Amanda goes to visit
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>her. “The sisters really want to get it together, but. ...&quot; The
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>problem, Amanda sees, is that there is very little overt brutal
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ity around which to organize. And the lack of it has diminish
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ed Jean; she looks listless and bloated. Amanda is reminded
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>of descriptions she’s read of mental patients subjected to in
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>sulin treatments and electroshock. Well, an indeterminate
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>sentence and the prison diet would do it to anyone. Amanda
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>goes back again and again, knowing Jean doesn’t have many
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>visitors now that her case is no longer publicized. But she
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>dreads the visits.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>After Jean’s release—she is recommended for parole on
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>grounds of good behavior—they avoid a review of their
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>history. Once, though, Jean tells-Amanda about her year
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>underground. &quot;You can’t imagine it, it was tremendous, like
			</p>
			<pb n='69'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>not having a face or something.” Amanda is a bit shocked by
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the eagerness with which her friend describes this oblitera
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tion; Jean is, she realizes, talking about the happiest year of
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>her life.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Back among the living, Jean’s time is once more entirely
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>taken up with political work, but work that is, so to speak,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>more ecumenical than formerly. She lends her name out to
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>worthy causes, is invited to speak with the likes of Martin
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Sostre, Morton Sobell, Angela Y. Davis. This broadening of
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>perspective is, after all, what Amanda had once hoped for.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Why, then, has she come to think of Jean as a has-been? The
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>two are cordial, but they do not meet often.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>should perhaps mention that there is a variant of this par
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ticular ending in which Jean is killed—murdered, that is, as
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the leaflets for the protest demonstration quite accurately
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>state — by police who claim she drew a gun while they were
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>attempting to apprehend her. But I tend to agree with Jean&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>own analysis that such fates, in this society, are typically
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>reserved for those &quot;more oppressed&quot; than she
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Typically—but not always.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>In the second ending, things remain fairly stable for a
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>period of some years. Jean continues her political graphics
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>work, her endless round of dreary meetings, ineffectual
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>demonstrations, lethal criticism/self-criticism sessions. (But
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>these harsh adjectives represent Amanda’s perspective; pro
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>bably Jean herself considers this life quite rewarding.) Jean
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and her friends never do anything drastic enough to incur
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>more than routine FBI harassment, phone taps, and arrests
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>for unruly courtroom behavior and illegal postering. The
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Organization, though disliked, has become a fixture on the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Left, and as such is tolerated. Its vitality is as mysterious as
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that of some fundamentalist sect which keeps predicting the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Final Days and is not the least bit chagrined when they fail to
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>materialize. The contradictions —make no mistake about
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>this—are heightening, deepening, intensifying.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Then one summer Jean is killed in a car accident. Amanda,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>hearing the news, experiences a confused sort of grief. But
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>she does not hesitate in deciding to attend the funeral. There
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>she learns what happens to daughters of the middle class
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>who are unaffected by petit bourgeois concerns for the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>future: their remains are claimed and borne away by
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>relatives who install them safely in suburban graveyards. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the most dismal finish Amanda can possibly imagine.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>One of the &quot;comrades&quot; invites Amanda to a sort of
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>memorial party or wake held in Jean’s old collective house
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Amanda is surprised to see how neat and pleasant everything
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>is, not Jean’s former chaos, the irrelevance of housekeeping
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>in the face of impending revolution. The walls are covered
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>with Jean’s graphics. Amanda notices how good they are.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Oh, she had always known Jean was good, of course, but it
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>had been hard to cling to that knowledge in the face of
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Jean’s deprecation of her own talent.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>lt’s not quite fair, Amanda thinks. What she means is that
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Jean gained a certain moral advantage by pretending to re
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>nounce art, while in fact she renounced nothing. “Did she
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ever talk about me?” she wants to ask Jean’s housemates,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>but doesn’t dare. She imagines she recognizes something like
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>her own face in a multi-ethnic grouping on one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>posters, but she can’t be sure.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>In the third and final ending, nothing happens. Both
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>Amanda and Jean go through many personal and political
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>changes, some of which appear ludicrous to outside
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>observers, but all of which are experienced as internally con
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>sistent. Yet the hurt of their rupture remains long after the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>circumstances which produced it have altered. They cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>seem to transcend this.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>Amanda tries — once. After a lapse of months or years, she
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>has another one of her dreams about Jean. Taking this as a
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>sign, she obtains Jean’s current phone number, calls her up.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>Could they meet to talk things over?
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>Jean is cool, but agrees. They choose a neutral spot for the
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>meeting, a women’s bar. Jean is typically late. Amanda sits
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>alone, nervous, drinking her beer, while around her couples
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sway, dancing, or sit at small tables gazing into each other&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>faces, no doubt absorbed in romantic dilemmas with which
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Amanda feels an overwhelming lack of sympathy.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Finally Jean arrives, apologizing perfunctorily for hei
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lateness; she was at a meeting. She orders a drink. They talk,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>review their history. But they are not getting to the real
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>point
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>&quot;Iloved you, I always loved you,” Amanda says suddenly,
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>risking. In the pause that follows this non sequitur, she hears
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the jukebox parodying her statement.
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>&quot;I think,&quot; Jean says finally, staring into her drink, “that
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>you’ve always been so goddamned involved with what !
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>represent, something I mean to you about yourself political
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ly or who you think you ought to be or something, that you
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>don’t have the slightest fucking idea what you feel about me
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>personally. So let’s not discuss it, okay?
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The truth, Amanda thinks, but not the whole truth. Yet
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>what choice has she other than to accept it?

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>that my body should always be under
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the control of my mind or reason; I was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>taught not to trust my so-called pas

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>If the Catholic Church were really Pro
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Life, then it would oppose all wars, the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>neutron bomb and guns. These are the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>things that destroy life. The Catholic
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Church is not Pro-Life. The Catholic
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Church is really anti sex! All those
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>celibate men can’t tolerate the idea
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that Catholic husbands and wives,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Catholic men and women, are actually

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The Church’s position on abortion is
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>really a punishment of women for the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sin of sex. Make no mistake about it, as
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>long as there’s been sex there has been
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>a sin, and someone has got to pay, and
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that someone has got to be the woman
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>— never the man. Men have always got
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ten away with the sin of sex. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>always taught in Catholic schools that
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>it was my job, my responsibility to keep

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Today the Church is saying that the

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>them say it over and over again. Life
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>begins at conception. Well, if the fetus
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>is a person and life begins at concep

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Catholic Church. Celibate men who
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>know nothing of women and pregnan-

				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>men—they have given up their own
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>sexuality, so now they spend all their
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>time totally preoccupied with other
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>people’s sexuality. Is this what Freud
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>meant by sublimation? Sex is always on
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>their minds. In Catholic schools I was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>taught good and evil but the only evil
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ever heard about was sex. If there was
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>another evil in the world, I had to
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>discover it for myself.
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>The reason the bishops are carrying
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>on about abortion is fear—fear that
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>they are losing control of the women. If
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>they lose control of the women, who
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>will they control? They have never con
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>trolled the men. In my experience, very
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>few Catholic men really believe; very
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>few follow the rules. It’s the women
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>who believe; it’s the women who have
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>followed the rules; and the women in -
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>turn keep the men in line. If they lose
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>control of the women, they’ve lost it
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The Catholic Church places little
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>value on women. That’s why they can
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>talk about life with no mention what-
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ever of the woman in whose uterus the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>fetus resides. We do not belong, we
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>have never belonged. We have always
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>been on the outside looking in. It is a
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>male church, male-dominated, male
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>run, with male actors worshipping a
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>male God. Throughout history the
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Church has never valued women, only
				<lb facs='#facs_71_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>virgins — that leaves most of us out.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In 1973, I defined cultural feminism as &quot;the belief that
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>women will be freed via an alternate women’s culture.&quot;&apos; The
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>definition still applies and cultural feminism still control
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the movement, but it is far less benign than it was then. The
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>matriarchal tendency has grown much stronger and spread
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>throughout the women’s movement. I use women’s move
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ment rather than women’s liberation movement as the name
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>for the entire movement because I consider the WLM
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>radical, and most of the current movement does not deserve
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that term; I have also avoided &quot;feminist movement
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>because feminism is a distinct political position which much
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of the movement does not share.) Cultural feminism has
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>evolved into spirituality and goddess-worshipping cults
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>disruptive &quot;dyketactics” groups and—more peacefully
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>academic cultural feminism, the main activity of which
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>seems to be reading novels by women. Cultural feminism is
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>an ideology. It is not the same thing as women’s art. Artiste
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>aren’t automatically cultural feminists any more than other

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Feminists circa 1970), I base my politics on the fact that men
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>oppress women; this is a basic oppression common to all
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>economic systems and classes, races, countries and other
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>groups throughout history. The only historically effective

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>independent mass movement of women whose goal in
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>women’s liberation from male supremacy. I would add that
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the solution to male supremacy lies in revolutionary feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>change and to accomplish this a movement must be political

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Of all the areas where cultural feminism is entrenched,
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the women’s movement press is crucial. It provides the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>movement’s main, and only open, communications. It lets
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>people know what’s happening within and outside their
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>issues and geographic areas. It provides information on up
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>coming events and what happened at previous ones, as well
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>as analysis of specific actions, issues and theory. Its prop

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ions, how and by whom these are being developed. It
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>reflects movement opinion, but it also helps shape it. Ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>are molded at least in part by what is read in the press. And
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>for many women outside the movement, their first exposure
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to an internal source is the movement’s local publication. In
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>short, the press supplies a forum—particularly important to
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>an oppressed group usually denied access to media outlets
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Thus, who controls the press is of pivotal importance. Out
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>side the reformist wing, there are no national multi-issue
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>organizations. In a relatively unstructured, decentralized
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>situation, the press is bound to be the major link for the

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Coast newspapers (with exceptions) were more feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>centered. Both concentrated on news of actions and on the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>lives and situations of women. Every time a book or TV show
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>on the movement appeared, it was criticized in detail, and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>mass media distortions and negative portrayals of women
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were routinely exposed.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Things have certainly changed since then. By 1974, almost

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>most of the journals had gone under before. To my
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>knowledge off our backs and Women’s Press are the only ear
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ly newspapers still extant. Movement publications have pro
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>liferated, but they are mostly newspapers devoted to pub
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>lishing local, intra-movement news. Theory and muckrak

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>avoided. I think these changes resulted from the takeover of
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cultural feminism as the dominant tendency of the women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>movement and from its alliances with liberal groups like the

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>is exacerbated by the fact that, in many parts of the country,

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cultural feminist leaders and the personality trend has been
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>pushed forward and reflected in movement publications.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The celebrity pitch—famous names and faces (especially on
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the coverl)—sells periodicals and the stars too. Bureaucracy
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and other power structures, in the women&apos;s movement and
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>out, breed a protection racket. Those in power must be pro

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>dience) must be protected from annoyance and disillusion.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The protection racket in turn leads to the &quot;circle of support.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>And this in turn leads to the double standard.&quot;“ One way this
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>is applied is in the preference for articles written by the staff
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>as opposed to those written by non-staff. This seems to be
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>part of publishing, but it feeds the incestuousness which is
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>such a prominent feature of the women&apos;s press. Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>staff members&apos; articles aren’t even looked over before they
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>go in, as they are written over layout weekend. The next step
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>down—frequently essential to getting published in a
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>periodical at all —is to be known to the staff. Being a big
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>movement name helps too.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>And finally the double standard is applied to the con
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>troversial article (controversial in a cultural feminist milieu
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>meaning anti-cultural feminist). The cost in time, energy and
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>perhaps unfavorable feedback means that, as Ann Leffler
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>has put it:
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>as the collective members become achingly familiar with the
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>cost of handling controversial material, they begin to twitch as
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>soon as they see manuscripts which even hint of controversy

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Into such a situation, at the start of the 70’s, entered a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>feminist cinema. In place of the Fathers’ bankruptcy of both
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>form and content, there was a new and different energy; a
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cinema of immediacy and positive force now opposed the

				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>had become the dominant cinema’s mainstays. In place of
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the Sons&apos; increasing alienation and isolation, there was an
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>entirely new sense of identification—with other women—
				<lb facs='#facs_77_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and a corresponding commitment to communicate with this

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>field of vision has altered. There is increased specialization,
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>both in the direction of genre studies (like film noir) and film
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>theory (particularly semiotic and psychoanalytic); the start

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>can leave woman-to-woman feminism looking declassé.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>Overall, there is a growing acceptance of feminist film as an
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>area of study rather than as a sphere of action. And this may

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>the merely representational.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>The chronology also shows the initial cross-fertilization
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>between the women’s movement and cinema, which took
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>place in the area of practice rather than in written criticism.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>The films came first. In fact, we find two different currents
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>feeding into film work: one made up of women who were
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>feminists and thereby led to film, the other made up of
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>women already working in film and led therein to feminism.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>It was largely the first group of women who began making

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>angle is unusually low. In interviews, Akerman explained
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>that the camera was positioned at her own height; since she
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>is quite short, the entire perspective of the film is different
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>from what we are used to seeing, as shot by male cinema
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>tographers. The perspective of every frame thus reveals a
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>female ordering of that space, prompting a reconsideration

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to the super-realist movement in painting. Two problems
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>arise with such a name: first, the tradition of cinematic

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the contradiction between their illusionism and Akerman&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>anti-illusionism. Another name applied to Jeanne Dielman
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was &quot;ethnographic,&quot; in keeping with the film&apos;s insistence on
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>real-time presentation and non-elliptical editing. Again, the

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>engendered by linguistic inadequacy.“ Jonas Mekas ques

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>did she commercialize it?” Later, praising most of the film as
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>a successor to Creed, he contended that the heroine&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>silence was more &quot;revolutionary” than the murder, making a

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>at the expense of its feminism. Amy Taubin considered the

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the camerawork and editing, she attacked the character of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Jeanne: &quot;Are we to generalize from Jeanne to the oppression

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>rejecting the character of Jeanne as a pathological woman.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Again we find a notion of pure art set up in opposition to a

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>defended the film for “the sense of renewal it has brought

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>information (Rainer’s ”emotional accretions”)—the words

				<lb facs='#facs_82_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>the women’s actions that advance the narrative; bonding

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>critics, and particularly academics, are understandably

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the strongest support for feminist filmmakers, so acceptance
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of a variety of filmic strategies can provide the vigor needed
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>by the feminist audience.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>For we must look to the filmmaker and viewer for a way
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>out of this aesthetic cul-de-sac. Aesthetics are not eternally
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>embedded in a work like a penny in a cube of lucite. They
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>are dependent on and subject to the work’s reception. The
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>formal values of a film cannot be considered in isolation, cut
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>off from the thematic correspondents within the text and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>from the social determinants without. Reception by viewers
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>as well as by critics is key to any film’s meaning. As my
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>chronology indicates, feminist cinema arose out of a need
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>not only on the part of the filmmakers and writers, but on the
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>part of the women they knew to be their audience. Today we
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>must constantly check feminist film work to gauge how alive
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>this thread of connection still is, how communicable its
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>feminist values are. We are in a time of transition now, when
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>we still have the luxury of enjoying feminist work on its
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>makers&apos; own terms, without having to sift the sands para

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>another class and a friend referred me to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the union. I took a three-month course and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>began working right away in one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>shops. I quit that job and became a
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>member of the union staff in 1973.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>JK: l’ve been working as an organizer for
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>District 65 for about two years. Originally!

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Wisconsin, where I was an office worker in

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>found out that 65 was organizing women
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>office workers. The day l arrived they were
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>hiring and I took the job.

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>program of District 65. I came into the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>union after working for 13 years in the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>publishing industry where I knew we
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>needed a union. It came to my attention
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>like a bolt of lightning that Harper and Row
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>had a union. When there was a strike there
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>encouraged a few co-workers at Simon

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>out. We discovered that there were

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that had the same idea. Some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>people there had formed a group and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>were thinking about affiliating with a

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>MA: I have been a secretary since 1945;

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>heart was always with union people, but

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>really beginning and I got a job in another
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>law firm. One of the women attorneys
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>asked to get together with the secretaries
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>to talk about the status of women in the
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>field of law. We quickly saw that our
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>interests were not the same as lawyers&apos; and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>we began meeting with receptionists and
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>file clerks in other firms. We decided that
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>we really needed our own union. One of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>us happened to have been a District 65
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>member for many years and decided to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>call the union. We were fortunate to find a

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ever. Basically your time belongs to your
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>boss. The only way to achieve your rights is
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>to form a union. But that doesn’t mean we
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>are all looking for the same way to exercise
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>those rights. I have been a secretary in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>many different kinds of offices. At times
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>have preferred to be the person who goes
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>out for cigarettes or coffee just to get away
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>from the desk. On the other hand, when
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>was a legal secretary and the work was
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>much more taxing, I certainly would not
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>appreciate being interrupted as though my
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>work was meaningless, as though his cup
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of coffee was more important. I think we
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>would be making a mistake if we made the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>issue: &quot;We don’t have to serve coffee.&quot; You
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>will find many women saying: “Whats
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>wrong with serving coffee?” The point is to

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>to discuss the format and who should be
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>assigned to various articles and so on. One
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>day they were planning a forum at which
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>some big celebrity type would come dowr

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>know what to do. I just went along. But

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Like, we all may be sitting together and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>somebody calls from another office or

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_2_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>might go, or you have to find out if theyre

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>decides on.- These biases filter down and
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>become part of people’s attitudes towards
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>each other. When we first began organ
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>izing in publishing where the ratio of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women is at least 70%, those of us who
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>were interested in organizing women saw
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>this issue of elitism in relationship to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>women clerical workers. We assumed that
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>by pointing to this issue women would im
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>mediately see the need to organize anc
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>unite. It took some arrogance on our part
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>not to recognize that for some women
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>there’s a certain comfort in doing specific
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>kinds of tasks, and they don’t want to be
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fought for by other women who have

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>feminist issue is: Did you get sent for the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>coffee because you are a woman?
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>MA: Even when you have a female boss,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>she sends you for the coffee. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>we’ve been told that education is the way
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>to make it, women hold lower positions
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and are making less money than men, re
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>gardless of their training. The thing that is
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>most exciting to me about organizing is
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>breaking through this myth and explaining
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that the best steward in the place is often
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>not the most skilled person. You go to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>college, get a degree-thats one way of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>elevating your status. But to get stature
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>amongst your co-workers, you have to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>show them you can fight out a grievance
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>on the job, and this ability has almost
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>nothing to do with education. You ob
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>viously need some training, but mostly you
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>need to be able to empathize with other
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>people and to stand up to your employer
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and show some courage. Women are
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>every bit as strong as men in these
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>respects. But there are other problems
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>which keep women from being as active as
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>men. Its hard for a woman with kids. Idon&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>think I could have been an organizer when
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>my two daughters were children. We’re
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>trying to think of ways that women can be
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>organizers or take staff jobs that demand
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>more than a 35-hour week and still have
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>children. Anayika came on the ERA march
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>with her sons, and there were others. But
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>there are more problems for women:
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>keeping house, demanding husbands or
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>boyfriends, children’s demands, etc. But in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>terms of women’s ability to be leaders
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>where they work, to be militant, to identify
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>problems and help workers organize, the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>important question is how you feel about
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>yourself. How do you make it out of a kind
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_4_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>of second-class citizenship as a woman?

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>issue, in feminist jargon. It just doesn’t work

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>too damned distorted by the media. Ithink
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the women’s movement should try to take
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>a broader view of what a feminist issue is.

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>everybody has been able to come up with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>to account for this. One, that we work in
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>sex-segregated jobs that are traditionally
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>low paid. Even then, nobody can explain
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>why secretaries are paid less than truck
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>drivers. Two, those very jobs are for the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>most part the unorganized ones. So, the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>two things feed into each other. You need
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>a union the same as any other workers

			</p>

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>you try to break down some of the barriers

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>are breaking into nontraditional jobs
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>through apprenticeship programs deserve
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>all the credit in the world for some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>junk they have to go through. But they
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>won’t do much to affect the majority of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>women in this country and to break that
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>pay gap of 606 on the dollar because most
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of us are going to continue to work in what
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>we call &quot;pink-collar jobs“—women’s jobs. In
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the union there are some ideas about
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>struggling legally for equal pay for work of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>comparable value. Now, how do you
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>decide that a secretary is worth more of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>less than another kind of job? I don&apos;t have
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>an awful lot of faith that this is a fruitful way
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>for women to bring about change. The
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>main tool that women have, that workers
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>have, is to organize to make their unions
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>into what they want them to be.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>JK: This morning I was talking to the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>organizing director of my union about do
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing this videotape and he said, &quot;But there
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>hasn’t been any impact on organizing from
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the feminist movement. It hasn’t made any
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>difference.&quot; He said, &quot;You know yourself,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>you tried to raise feminist issues to see if
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that would propel women in organizing.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>said, &quot;Well, to the extent that more women
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>are organizing now, that’s feminism.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Female-intensive industries have begun to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>organize and that&apos;s feminism.&quot; He said, very
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sincerely, &quot;Sometimes, only if you give
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>them an acceptable male organizer. And
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>thats ironic but true. Some women still
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>respond better to a male organizer be
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>cause of his age or experience or some
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>sense that he’s tough and knows the ropes
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>in the business world. It takes guts and self
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>confidence to organize. So, you see, the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fact that women are doing it is a feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>HW: To me, everything is feminism, you
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>know—working and going home and
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>coming back, whereas the husband is lying
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>around. Why should she have to work
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>because he isn’t working? You know, going
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>to work, getting into the bus. All those
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>things are feminism. All those things are ex
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ploitation either by the husband, by the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>boss, and the women don’t realize this yet.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Al: I had a wonderful experience with
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>friends who were organizing. I’m not an

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>It costs me a lot of courage. I remember
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>when I started to become more like a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>human being, people started to give me a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>name from feminism. No problem,
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>’m proud of it. My case is very
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>complicated. Im a woman, a
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>mother, Haitian, and we have
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N062'/>different cultures. I could try

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>seems like in order for a woman to keep
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>her husband or her boyfriend, she can&apos;t or
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ganize herself, you know? l like the idea of
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>being free but I wouldn’t overstep the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>bounds. Like l’m not going to be out on the
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>town when my husband is home. But
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>always say, if he’s not home why can’t I not

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>shouldn’t be there. l have to be home. I did
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>so many things, even more than him. I took
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>care of my kids. I worked. I belonged to
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>different activities. And I started these
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>things when I started to realize how
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>marriage is. Like my husband comes home:
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>if Im not there he goes wild but if l&apos;m there
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>everything is cool. I was like a vegetable,

				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>person. I like being with people, helping.
				<lb facs='#facs_87_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>But then some women say thats acting like
