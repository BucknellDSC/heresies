				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Heresies is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what is commonly
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>called art can have a political impact and that in the making of art and all
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>cultural artifacts our identities as women play a distinct role. We hope
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that Heresies will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aes
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>thetic theory, as well as generate new creative energies among women. It
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>will be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>broadening the definition and function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Heresies is published by a collective of feminists, some of whom are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists, or anarchists; our fields include
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>history, architecture, filmmaking, photography, and video. While the themes
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of the individual issues will be determined by the collective, each issue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>will have a different editorial staff, composed of members of the mother
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>collective and other women interested in that theme. Heresies provides
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>experience for women who work editorially, in design, and in production.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>An open evaluation meeting will be held after the appearance of each
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>issue. Heresies will try to be accountable to and in touch with the inter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>national feminist community.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lives, our arts, and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these connec-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>tions are clarified, they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>between artist and audience, and to understand the relationship between
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward the demystification
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of art, we reject the standard relationship of criticism to art within the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>present system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>product. We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>they are made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>aesthetic, nor to the competitive mentality that pervades the art world.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>process of this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In the process of working on this issue, we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>were increasingly aware of the shifting
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>parameters of our positions as professiona.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>artists grappling with complex notions of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>community. If “Community Art” has tra
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ditionally been perceived as clearly markec
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>territory, we did not find this to be true.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>More characteristic in this collection is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>work by women who are actively defining
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>community art in new ways.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Many artists have asserted their indiffer
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ence to an art world founded on a market
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>economy by doing work that engages a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>specific community. Well aware of artistic
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>activity outside the mainstream, we were
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>not always able to access the self-contained
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>communities which nevertheless served as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a motivating force for this collective.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>While our individual differences were as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>great as the work which we received, our
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>collective interests were often peculiarly
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>similar. We found ourselves most drawn
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to work by artists who stepped out of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>bounds, pushing the limits both of the art
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>object and of the communities that make
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and/or receive it. We kept up an ongoing
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>discussion as to the nature of marginality
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in relation to a mainstream, but as we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>pursued this dichotomy, a multiplicity of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>artistic centers appeared. We engaged the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>issues of political, racial, economic and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>art world boundaries, yet rather than focus
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>on being locked in, we have looked for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>work that created its own context, super
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>seding the given spectrum of validation.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>The work that we received lifted the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>confines of art viewing both geographi-

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Kea Tawana’s Ark is a work of art, a mon-
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ument of unique proportion, situated in
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the urban landscape of Newark, New
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Jersey. This structure reflects Ms.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Tawana’s unique vision, which draws
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>on a range of myths and symbols from
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the Judeo-Christian tradition.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Known as Kea’s Ark, the ship stands
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>three stories tall in a church parking lot
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>by the Humanity Baptist Church at 235
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Bergen Street. Quite a site in the midst of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Newark’s Central Ward. Kea Tawana is
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>struggling to create her ark. City officials
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>say it is an eyesore that detracts from the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>business of urban renewal in a devastated
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>neighborhood. They threaten to have it
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>demolished.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Arising from the ruins of the Central
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Ward, the ark’s hand-hewn keel and ribs
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>are made of salvaged timbers. Ms. Tawana,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>a self-taught structural engineer, has for
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the past four years shaped the timbers by
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>hand, drilled and chiseled mortises and
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tenons so they fit together. Ms. Tawana
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>said that she studied 19th-century ship
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>building and developed her own technol
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>ogy for the ship’s special framework. “By
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>marine design the ark is a vessel capable of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>sailing in the high seas. The ark is to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>museum for Newark and the people who
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>built it.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Ms. Tawana was a welder in the early
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>70s, working in the basement of what was
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>once a blacksmith shop in 1680. “The
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>museum would show the truth about
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Newark and its building, about the slavery
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that existed and how the black iron work
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ers built the city for three hundred years.
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Ms. Tawana found chains and other arti
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>facts under the floor in the shop and traced
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>old deeds and records. She said that “in
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>three years, the galleries on the ark would
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>be open to viewers.” The plans for the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ship museum include a chapel, ward
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>rooms, museums of industry and culture,
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>a historical library containing hundreds of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>books, (some dating to the 1700’s), and

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>1981 as part of the community’s response to the London
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Docklands redevelopment program. We started with a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>single hoarding unveiled in Wapping Lane in 1981. Now
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we have six hoarding sites all over Docklands circulating
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>fourteen images, 45 meters of exhibitions for loan, and a

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>rial. The role of the photomurals is to present a broad
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>view of what is happening—“The Changing Picture of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Docklands.” The Project’s steering committee guides
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>all decisions concerning the issues to be dealt with and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the siting of the hoardings. They are sited where they
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>can be seen repeatedly by local people, rather than by
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>passing motorists. Each mural measures 18 X 12 feet and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>is a hand-colored photographic enlargement of an origi-
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>nal photomontage. Each enlargement is divided into 18
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>panels which are replaced a few at a time so that the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>picture is constantly changing, revealing different as
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>pects of an issue or relationships between issues. As a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>set of panels is removed from one site it moves onto
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>another, so forming a circuit of photomurals throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Docklands, as well as in two locations in bordering
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>boroughs. Posters, banners, newssheets and exhibitions
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>all play an important part in campaigning. The real
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>value of the Project’s work is achieved through its
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>interaction with the wider network of tenants’ and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>action groups. Our steering committee ensures the

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ans. And I was curious about Natalie

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>her assertion of her lesbianism and her

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ration with a group; she would direct both
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the group and the play. She was interested

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>expatriate and lesbian living in Paris from

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Natalie Barney was at the center of a
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>flourishing community of lesbians who

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lived the most independent lives they

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>research and create a play with us.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I was interested but hesitant, because l
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was not an actress. Stephanie told me that

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>life.” I was intrigued and agreed to come

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>work on the project.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>At that first meeting there were about
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fifteen women. They were teachers, thera

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>jewelry business. Most of them had a

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>were musicians, writers, and dancers.

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>work today. My body was tremendously sen-
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>sitive and following its own rhythms, doing
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>very erratic, jolting, out-of-step movement. I
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>feli the group move around me like water, like
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>a current of energy and each woman in it an
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>electrical knot. I felt my own body as glacier
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>surfaces, holding angles and sides up against
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the water, bobbing along from one spin of the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>current to the next. I tried to yield. I could noi
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>move like them, could only approximate their
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>speed by spinning in one place. My hands
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>filled at one point and rose above my head,
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>holding all of the room’s electricity at once.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>They were alive and floating over my head. I
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>felt then my power as a transmitter, a symbol
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>standing high and still. I wanted to cry from
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the fragility, but my hands drained and I
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dropped my arms slowly.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>These movement sessions let us know
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>each other on levels that conversation does
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>not bring us to, giving us a bodily flexibility
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and openness that support the vocal and
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>thematic explorations. Stephanie would
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>have us lie on the floor and guide us
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>through breathing exercises designed to
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>root our voices more deeply, so that we
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>could speak from the diaphragm or belly
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>rather than from the throat. Her image for
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>this was to let our breath “touch sound.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>This image did not make sense to me for
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>months. But as I worked with it, I experi
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>enced how a hum could vibrate up from
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>my belly through my lungs and through-
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>out my lower and upper back. This partic-
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ular learning was important because with
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>it I began to believe that I could experi-
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>ence something first and “understand” it
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>later. In a way, this was the basis of all of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>our work: we were taking the facts of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Natalie Barney’s life and believing that
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>with our experience and imaginations we
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>could fill in theirs. We were not analyzing

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>her but trying to bring her to life.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Through this process each of us cre
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ated the role of Natalie (or Romaine or
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Gertrude) many times from our individual
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>point of view. Each of us got a chance to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>“be” Natalie in a particular situation and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to enact what we thought she would do or
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>say. Of course this meant bringing fully to
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>life our own imaginations, feelings, and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>memories. We were speaking to the Paris
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>lesbians through each other and our col
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lective imagination made it possible for
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the group to know more than any one of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>us could have known individually.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Discussion of our work, March 1981—
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Eileen Jones
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I get up with my idea of Natalie in a certain
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>situation and behave as I think she would
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and other people in the group respond to what
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I started and elaborate that response. Then
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>my notion of the character of Natalie is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>expanded into something that I wasn’t able to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>see or show.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The group acts as a mirror for that one
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>image and it is suddenly opened up in nine
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ways, into nine pieces which I wasn’t able to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>show but which I can take in. Next time I get
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>up I have ten pieces of that characterization
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>to work with instead of one.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I, who had never done experimental
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>theater or creative movement, was alter
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>nately shocked, delighted, terrified, and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>fascinated by the work and the women in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the group. I recall that I often had to drag
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>myself to that studio and sometimes in the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>middle of workshops l’d be overcome by
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>sleep.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Journal entry, December 1980
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Today I saw that this learning is the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>whole point—not performing for everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>else—but discovering something myself alone.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>That the point of art at this stage, creative
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>development, is NOTTHE AUDIENCE
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>but the personlartist me. Stephanie calls this
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>inner research.” Inner? With other people
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>watching? It’s very hard. This is why I
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>write—it&apos;s an art in which l’m alone during
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the creation. It forces me at the beginning to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>be without an audience.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>This makes me realize something about
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>separatism. Separatism means I no longer
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>feel this audience of men constantly around
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>me. I don’t have to perform for them. My
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>every thought and feeling is not a performance.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>I began to dream about Natalie Barney
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and her friends. I also dreamed about the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>women in the Paris Project. I wrote poems
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>about Natalie and Romaine. I began to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>think my life was really my own.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>We ended each workshop with a “go
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>around.” Each of us had a chance to talk
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about the workshop, react to Stephanie’s
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>exercises, and speculate on the evolving
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>themes of the play. Each woman’s time
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>was limited but uninterrupted. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>understood that she could ask questions of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>anyone, express anything, and the person
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>she addressed could choose whether to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>respond directly when her turn came. The
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>go-around was an integral and necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>part of our work. There we could “resur
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>face” after an intense session. We could
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>speak to each other as individuals, inte
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>grating the feelings of the characters we’d
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>played or the memories we’d evoked. It
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was necessary, too, to talk about what
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>we’d just done and how it affected us
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>when we walked out of the studio back
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>into our daily lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>That summer we worked together every
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>weekend at a house in upper New York
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>State. There we worked on their relation-
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ships and our relationships. We explored
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the triangles that had formed in Natalie
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Barney’s circle, her long relationships and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>short ones, her philosophy of non
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>monogamy, her love affairs and friendships.

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>books, the endless production and expres

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>At this point we had begun to take
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>singing classes. One of us fell in love with
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>our teacher and left the group. This was a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>shock because, after the initial weeding
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>out, no one had left in the two years since
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the project began.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Our commitment was enacted every
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>time we worked together. It was a com

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>each other and in this way to be in each
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>other’s lives. The group had been able to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>stay together thus far because it was elastic
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>enough to allow people to be very close to

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>open to the group and our work. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>difficult for me to understand how Tonia,

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>could leave it. It was also difficult for me

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Tonia has left the theater group.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Just let that sentence stand alone like I guess
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Tonia wants to do. Why is she doing it like
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>this? Cutting off her nose to spite her face. I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>feel somewhere inside she must be crazy not to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>stick with us. Insanity, that kind of insane
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ness, comes out as arbitrary control, like a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>chopping blade coming down, cutting you
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>right off—it&apos;s terrifying. She said once in a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>workshop that there were two Tonias, one in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the light, one in the darkness. Now her hands
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>wave in front of her face and nothing is there,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>nothing. I bent her glasses the last time we
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>worked together. I sat on them, by mistake.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Oh, Tonia, don’t do this. Why do I fear you
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>won&apos;’t survive, that you&apos;ll die? Because I
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>would if I left? Because you are always
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>wanting and can never see when you get
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>anything? The huge dissatisfaction in you
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>unnerves me.“Iwant, I want” should involve
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>you, but it has cut you off, hasn&apos;tit?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>The following summer Stephanie and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Carol had a draft of the script, taken
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>directly from the improvisation scenes of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>the workshops. We began to go through
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>the script scene by scene, improvising on
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the lines, creating the scenes first this way,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>then that. We spent the month of August
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>living together in New Paltz where the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>university had given us their theater to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>rehearse in. This rehearsal work came
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>after lines were set but before the final
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>blocking of the piece. We had the skele-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ton, that month we gave it a body. We gave
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it numerous bodies, in fact, with numer
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ous perspectives on each one. We ques
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tioned ourselves and our characters, for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>questions were our way of opening up the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>picture, of showing the myriad views one
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>could take of a situation or a person. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>often said about our work that we did not
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>make statements so much as reveal the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>complexity of any one statement. Our
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>questions, then, did not look for answers
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>but showed different ways of seeing the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>world. They acknowledged that each of us
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>creates her own word which we somehow
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>live in together.
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Some of our questions to Natalie
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Barney:
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>What were you doing during World War
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>II? In Paris? In Italy? (To myself: What
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>would I have done?)
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Did you really love all of those women?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Each one, truly, genuinely, or was it just
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>for sex? (To myself: What does it matter if
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>she really loved them? What does really
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>loving someone mean anyway? What if it
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was just for sex—why does that bother
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>you? Is it because she was “immoral” or
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>too” free?)
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Why were you such a snob? Why
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>didn’t you associate with the lesbians
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>in the Paris bars who cross-dressed,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>who passed as men, who were poorer
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>than you?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>(To myself: Who do I not associate
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with? Why are all of my friends and lovers
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>white? How do I feel about very butchy
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women? How do I feel when my hair is
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>very short and I get called “son” or “sir”:
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Why didn’t you call yourself an Artist?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>How could you say, “My life is my art, my
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>writing is but the result?” What does that
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>mean? Were you afraid? (To myself: Why
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>do I have to define myself as an artist?
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Why can’t I be as relaxed as she was about
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>it? Do I even want to be?)
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>During that month I also fell in love. It had
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>been long coming on, having begun the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>summer before. I didn’t admit I was in love
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>—I worked with her, was inspired by the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>group, by our work, by her, and by my own
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>evolving sense of strength and freedom.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ago. Bats fly from tree to tree. The sky loses

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>changing their rhythms and sounding again
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>insistently. They scream out from two sides of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>my corner room. I do like having this room to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>myself. I leave my loneliness here and the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>room is plenty big enough for it. It’s always

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>night. Now Linda will come and where will
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it go? l’m growing sleepy with the admission
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of, not loneliness, but aloneness. Eileen got a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>complicated letter today. I wish l’d get a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>complicated letter. Aloneness and some ab

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that. Here there is a general intimacy which
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>buoys me up most of the time, but sometimes l
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>just feel teased and frustrated. Some inability

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>l&apos;’ve been with the most these days. I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>want it to stop, only I feel my need, desire,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>intensity, getting closer to the surface, feel

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>do I do with these feelings? Use them in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the work?
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I easily feel so tender towards her. I show
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>it by staying with her in silence, reading,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>laughing and hitting the shuttlecock, bringing
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>her tea, listening and asking questions. She
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>shows it too and I get confused, frightened,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>happy, on edge. Sounds like I have a crush on
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>her. But I know her too well for that. Does it
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>make a difference? I suppose l’Il get very
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>angry and hateful about her sooner or later.

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>August 17—Linda is snoring. Yvonne and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Stephanie are talking and laughing in their
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>room. Eileen just left the bathroom. Margot
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and Carol have been quiet for some time now.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Yvonne asked me today if l’m attracted to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Eileen. I said “Yes, of course,” and then
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>proceeded to fall all over myself trying to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>explain what I meant. That I felt her sensi
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tivity and the communication with her at
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>times was so clear, but I don’t know what all
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of that has to do with being attracted. I guess
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>it has more to do with falling in love but I
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>couldn’t explain that to Yvonne. Or to any
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>one else, probably. My feelings seem to go
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>from tender admiration and pleasure to pain
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ful confusion in the blink of an eye. That
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>experience reminds me of being in love. Will
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>it ever “take”? NO. Michelle told me about
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>her most intense relationship, being with an
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Italian woman for 9 years and it never being
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sexual. Huh. l’m not the type. But Eileen is.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>A“romantic friendship”?
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>August 25—Made love with Eileen last
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>night. l’m happy.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Our relationship as lovers began and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ended in the context of the group. Much
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of the passion, terror, excitement and joy
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>that l’d found in this group and our work
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>was in my relationship with Eileen. The
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>bond between us carried echoes of our
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>work together, our fears and ambitions for
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ourselves and this group, this play. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>also a love affair. We were never a “cou
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ple,” for that is not how our relationship
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>began or developed. We were drawn to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>gether, loved each other, couldn’t stay
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>together, drew apart, and continued to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>work on the play. The group and its work
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>were our pivot, the commitment which
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>held us together when our relationship
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>came apart.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In the winter of 1983 the project was
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>close to the end—we would perform the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>play in May. The roles had been cast and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>each of us began to work more exclusively
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>on her own character. Despite these new
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>focuses, the play continued to be a com
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>plex interweaving of the whole group’s
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>vision. Each of us knew where every line
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>by every character had originated. We all
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>had stories, wells of images and feelings,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>as a base for every scene and each charac-
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ter’s point of view.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Our rehearsals were taken up with
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>staging scenes, trying on costumes, learn
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ing harmonies, memorizing choreography.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>It was a time of great excitement and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>stress. I think each of us, separately,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>doubted that she could pull it off.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Journal entries, September and October 1982
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I wonder if my dreams last night had to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>do with my growing awareness that I will in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>fact begin to perform again and how very
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>different it will be from when I used to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>dance. This will be a conscious me on stage.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Dancing, I was alone with the music, my

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>much audience contact, but now I remember
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>that when I danced, as soon as I got comfort
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>able out there on stage, l’d look for the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>audience, try to see their faces and eyes. I
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wanted that contact but it scared me. I
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>dreamed all night of the “Lifting Belly” song.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I was very affected, shot through with it
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>—seduction and passion, but I felt disturbed
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>too, very restless. I kept waking up, running
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>my hands over my body, slapping a humming
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>mosquito away from my ear. The trees outside
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>made a rushy, rusty sound like people turning
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>around against their mattresses.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Awful rehearsal tonight—the opening
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and closing in my chest and all I can feel
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>(when I do feel) is the rock, the rock inside
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>me. I get close, walk right up to it and scratch
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>it speculatively, stroke it hesitantly. But when
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>I slow down my flailing arms and unsteady
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>knees, I just want to stop, sit down, be
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>anywhere but here—because I can’t do it, I
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>just cannot do it, there isn’t enough protection.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>I feel exposed and just want to shriek and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_7_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>disappear. I can’t tolerate being pushed by

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Eileen—l’m so angry most of the time.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>When I feel pushed, it’s a real effort for me to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>stay there in any way, shape or form.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Through all of this there was a thread
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of memory for me —this was a commit
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ment not only to produce a theater piece,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>but to understand what it meant that this
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>community of lesbians had come before
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>us, that there were many communities of
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>lesbians who had defined themselves be
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>fore us, and what that meant to us and our
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>community now.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Evidently the production was impor
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tant to others besides us. We had invest
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ors; people volunteered to make sets, sew
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>costumes, assist in direction, make slides,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>do promotion and stage manage. It meant
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>something to many people that this was a
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lesbian play with lesbians acting in it. We
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>were saying: this was important enough to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>put three years of our lives into. We were
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>saying that lesbian relationships were im
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>portant enough and common enough to be
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the subject of our play.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>During that time I was internally pre-
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>occupied with the character I played
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>-Renee Vivien. She seemed to me a
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>beautiful, sensitive, romantic, pathetic,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>masochistic, sometimes talented, writer
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>She was also a “lost soul,” alcoholic and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>anorexic. She had a preoccupation with
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>death. She ruined her relationship with
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Natalie Barney that way. She died young
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>at age thirty-one. I felt drawn by this
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>character into a realm of intense sensation
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and emotion —what I saw, smelled,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>touched and felt were my world. True to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the integration of our lives and the play,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>lines I wrote inspired by Eileen months
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>before were used as Natalie’s farewell
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>speech to Renee:
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>The first time I saw you, I knew who you
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>were, what came surging to your eyes,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>bubbling to your lips—a kind of life
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>blood, some gold, some give. I knew you
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>would show me how to live in this world.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>You knew I would remember everything:
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>that your face would imprint itself on my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>heart and my heart would pour and pour,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>that I would ache with your beauty and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>mine, that I would want to meet you again
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>and again like the first time. You knew my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>love would pour out in memories and
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>finally that I would capture it, hold it,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>press it to me, freeze it into words, that l
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>would fix it forever in the pages of my

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I was writing a lot of poetry at that
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>time and most of it was about denial,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>repression and loss. I had to remind my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>self that all lesbians were not tragic, all
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>artists not too sensitive to live in this
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>world, all women not suicidal or self
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>destructive. I reminded myself: “She’s
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dead and you’re alive. She left this world,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>you have not.” It was the end of a three-
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>year dialogue and relationship with these
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>women. Finally, it was a separation; our
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>imaginations had brought us close to them,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>then back to the present, to our own lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>The play was reviewed; we were eu-
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>phoric; we fought with each other; we
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>were exhausted. We performed The Paris
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Project twelve times. When it was over, we
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>had plans. We thought we would get big
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>investors to put it on off-Broadway,
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>thought we’d get more vocal and dance
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>training, a bigger cast, a better theater, we
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>thought ... a lesbian play on Broadway!
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>None of that happened.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The first act was rewritten. We read it
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>for various investors and potential direc
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tors. We haggled over the producers’ con-
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ditions. One pair of men wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>produce it if they could get a ten-year
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>option on all proceeds, including memora
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>bilia, such as T-shirts and record albums.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>And, of course, they wanted the option to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>re-cast the play.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>We discussed this endlessly. Did we
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>want to give up our rights to the play? Did
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>we want to risk its never being produced
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>again? Were we holding on to it only to
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>condemn it to a life “on the shelf”? Our
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>composer wanted her music sung again;
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>we wanted our words spoken again.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>We never gave up the option. We
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>didn’t have the heart to give someone else
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>control over a play that had been taken so
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>directly from our own lives. We also did
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>not do the necessary fundraising or grant
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>writing to produce the show again. We
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>wanted to create and perform. So the
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>group left the play behind and went on
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to do new pieces.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Finally, we created in our work a world
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>in which lesbians were at the center
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>-where we were human beings, not out-
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>siders defined by the mainstream as
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>queer.” We continued as a performing
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>group for the next four years, developing
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>theater based on our lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The Paris Project ended with these
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lines of Gertrude Stein’s:

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>As a group, we did remember, and

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>give some general background about yourself, tell how and where
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>you grew up, and describe your education?
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Minh-ha-I was educated for the most part in Vietnam, then in
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the Philippines, in France, in the U.S., and since I learned more
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>than what I taught during my three-year stay in Dakar, I can
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>also add, in Africa. I left Vietnam for the U.S. in 1970 at the age
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of seventeen and was mainly trained in comparative literature,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and music: composition, ethnomusicology, and applied music
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>-piano, organ, percussion and Vietnamese zither. I also painted
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>for many years, and my interest in cultural anthropology dates
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>back to the time in Vietnam when I discovered, with much
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>bewilderment, the feeling of being “other,” through reading
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>about myself as a cultural entity offered up in writings by the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>European colonial community. My involvement in film came
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>much later. It is difficult to say when exactly I first got inter
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ested in it. It would be easy to find some details in my child
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>hood that would account for a precocious inclination for this
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>field, but such myth-building practice easily generates compla

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>through the particularities of the filmmaker’s personality.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>H-So, what compelled you, inspired you, to make the kinds of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>films you make? What was life like for you in Vietnam?
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>M-h-It’s a vast question. I would join a number of Vietnamese
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>women in saying that “if equality consists of being poor to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>gether, then the Vietnamese society in its non-corrupted sectors
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>is truly egalitarian!” Those of us who were town-dwellers were
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and still are “uprooted on our own land,” so thoroughly upset
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>were we in our way of living. We all shared the insecurities of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>war. The burden has been such that it accounts for the pro
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>found and widespread silence that many Vietnamese still live
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>with in regards to this war and its aftermath. What inspired me
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to make films like Reassemblage and Naked Spaces? Certainly
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Africa. But why Africa? In looking at these films, I would say
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that they lie somewhere between the very gratuitous and the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>highly-motivated shores. On one hand, if they are so difficult

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>hence this statement at the outset of the film: “I do not intend
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to speak about/Just speak near by.” On the other hand, these
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>films are also strongly motivated by an experience that I lived
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>through in formerly colonized Vietnam and that I clearly recog-

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>films that would always point to the process of constructing not
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>truth, but meaning, and to myself as an active element in that
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>process, both as a foreign observer of a specific culture and as a
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>member of the general cultural zone and non-aligned bloc of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>countries known as the Third World.

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>M-h-No mentors. What inspires me most are usually people’s

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>tional works, then I will say the poetry of Ho Xuan Huong (a
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Vietnamese woman poet), Thich Nhat Hanh, Basho, Aime
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Cesaire, Ezekiel Mphahlele, and the prose of Assia Djebar, Cla
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>rice Lispector, Zora Neale Hurston. But these do not include
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>many works of Euro-American artists and writers, which may
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>or may not have an impact on me, despite my inclination for
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>them. In film, I used to like Kurosawa, Ozu, Marker, Vigo,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Mizoguchi, Godard, Satvajit Ray, Bresson. Today, I would rather
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>see a film by Chantal Ackerman, Valeria Sariento, Yvonne
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Rainer, or Sally Potter—recent encounters that have no influence
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>on my film work. With a cross-cultural interdisciplinary back
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ground, it’s difficult to single out a name or even a few names
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that have had a major impact on my work. The list is so long
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>that Tam afraid it would sound like name-dropping more than it
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>would illuminate. In any case, naming is always a political choice:
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>one gives the names one likes to be associated with or judged
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>upon according to the times, often for the purpose of validation.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>On the other hand, there is no such thing as a one-way influ
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ence. What I do influences my understanding of others’ doings
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and vice-versa; and I never understood certain aspects of the films
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>I previously liked as well as now that I make films myself.

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>notion of difference, I focus on the relationship between women

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of difference on which both the Universal and the Particular
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>(historical, cultural, political) are at play. As a statement in the

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>couples. These houses have no angularities in their exterior as
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>well as interior forms. All the elements that I see as being con

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>in the film—wall painting and sculpture; (curved) built-in fea
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tures of enclosed spaces; pots and calabashes that contain their
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>belongings, the water they fetch, or the food they cook; the

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>emphasize the womb-image of the house. As several statements

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>but their decorations insist on the house as fertility site, as life
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>giving force. Woman being juxtaposed with approaches to liv
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ing and theories of creation is hardly surprising in this context.

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>brings forth the tight relationship between woman, house and

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>young men are shot so as to show the circles they form and the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>participation of women in fertility rituals; the film ends on one
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of these dances, but the last sounds and images are those of the

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>us, the coast is clear. We should be the ones to define this differ

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>feminism could be understood and practiced. One cannot rely

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>wrapped-up package to offer to the viewer (hence also, as I men-
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tioned earlier, the diffiuclty of saying what the films are really
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>about). The messages foregrounded are necessarily plural as the

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the viewers. Being truthful to oneself and to one’s making is, as
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>said in another statement of the film, “being in the in-between

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>by a sum of facts. When one realizes the aberrations carried out
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>in the name of truth, one is compelled to question the objectiv
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ity of any notion—of truth as well as the search for truth itself
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>and its absolutism. If it sounds quite common to challenge facts
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>vis-a-vis truth, it is quite uncommon to see this incorporated in
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>documentary practice. I am thinking here of the numerous films
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that claim (in their tone and in the way they offer information
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>more than in any explicit statement) to give us a scientific view
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of the natives.’ What is considered ’scientific’ or ’objective’ is
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>often no more than the adaptation of a number of film codes
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and of an established approach in documenting, in other words
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>a question of ideology. Reality is necessarily always adaptive
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>With the spread of these films in popular consumer progams on
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>television, it becomes more and more difficult for many of us
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>not to confuse fact with truth; hence these statements in Naked
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Spaces: “The diagnostic power of a fact-oriented language”;
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Truth or fact”; or “reality and truth: neither relative nor abso-
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>lute.” To the culturally/sexually dominant mind everything not

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>smooth transitions, in other words, that does not bear the ’pro

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>this image and that image, and so on). If you remember, there is
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>a comment on African music at the start of the film that says:
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>It (the music) does not simply play’/In such a way as not to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>impinge on the viewing.” The illustrative relationship usually
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>found in film between sound, image and text; the cosmetic role
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>often attributed to music; and the exclusively informative func

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>what the outcome will be. In incorporating silence as one deter-

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>viewers’ expectations; the music is often cut off abruptly, thereby
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>pulling them out of the atmosphere they have been bathed in,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>while the visuals incorporate casual jump-cuts, out-of-focus

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>with an orgiastic crescendo. On the other

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>not socialized to tell others what to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Like similar debates (do women write

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>haps women’s minds are just as analytical
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and linear as men’s, and hence their com

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>had an equal opportunity to compose

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>with women’s own musical process? First,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>women would have to have the freedom to
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>take their clothes off and create music
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>uninhibited by imposed social and mate
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>rial forms. In Hawaii, a society once more
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>matriarchal than our own (having female
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>deities, for instance), women and men
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>chanted in the same tonal range, from D
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>above middle C to A below it; husbands
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and wives chanted only a half note apart.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Hawaiian women’s voice range would be
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>considered “a man’s” in our culture. These
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>women were more centered in their bod-

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Clothes are formally connected with the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>music of a particular period. By the nine

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>more allowed to make music in public,
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>they performed in the tight corsets and

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>creating female clothing and reembedding
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>our sounds in our bodies would be a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>precondition to rediscovering a natural
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>women’s sound. Even women who have
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>adopted male clothing might discover a
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>female vibratory pattern if allowed to ex-

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>they could don whatever costume seemed

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>A second suggestion would be to play
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>from emotional impulse and color visual

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>western civilization. I suggest this to tap
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>into women’s own musical process; when
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>it comes to preserving their work, abstract
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>notation can still be done as a later step in
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the process. It should be recognized that
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>in the sign system of modern western
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>music, which arose with patriarchal civili
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>zation, we have in the treble clef the eter
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>nal feminine cycle (albeit with a line
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>through the middle) attached to the staff,

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>But notation was not always black and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>white. In the beginning of the linear nota-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tion of music, color was also used, at least
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>as a coding system. Only gradually did
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>written music become an analytical ab
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>straction, creating a tendency toward com
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>posing by mental gymnastics;” and some
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of the most flowing music by men (Eric
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Satie, Scriabin) was created by color and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>poetic visualization.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>To create from erotic, sensuous and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>emotional stimulation would be to draw
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>from what has become popularly known
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>as right brain, metaphoric or synesthetic
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>thinking. Here again we connect with the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>primitive” (and in no way inferior) source
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>of sound: tribal singing used to create
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>music tied with visualization and emotion.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>For example, mourning ritual among the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Kahuli entails singing about an ancestor

			<p>

				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>space in the jungle. The musical visualiza-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tion is intended to bring about a catharsis
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>judged successful by the lyric’s ability to
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>bring out emotion.“ Or, again to refer to
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Hawaii, a lover would visualize the loved
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>one and sing a strain designed to reach
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>him or her; these songs were the vibratory
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>medium through which lovers contacted
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>each other before the telephone. To recon-
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tact our own sources of sound we can use
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>what has been dismissed in our civiliza
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tion as “like a woman,” “childlike, or
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>primitive.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>A third route to our own music would be
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to use forms more common in matriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>civilization such as rotation of parts and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>instruments (even if we use western in
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>struments). African drumming, for exam
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ple, has several parts: each drummer learns
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>all the parts, and those parts are rotated
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>among the players. How might this apply
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>in our search for the matriarchal ear and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>sound? We might use the instruments of
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the traditional western orchestra, but in
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>matriarchal ways that overcome ranking
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and specialization. The harpist could move
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to the chair of the first violin; the flautist
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>could move to the seat of the oboist, and
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>so on: a circular game of musical chairs.
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>There is no need to be a purist about the
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>instruments we use, although purity has
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>been argued for by Women Against Rock
				<lb facs='#facs_22_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>most recently at the Alliance for Cultural

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>saw art made under the assumption that women had power.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Women were depicted as catalysts and forces in the world. I
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>wondered what kind of struggle it took to make these films. I also
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>wondered whether questions of feminism had been discussed
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>during the production. All the revolutionary operas and ballets
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>have women as strong characters. How did Chinese women feel
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>about these images and in what way did the works relate to their
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>culture as a whole?
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I also had critical questions about the forms, which seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to be strange choices for revolutionary art. Wasn’t it true that
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>both ballet and opera were steeped in western capitalist tradi
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tions? How could a country just liberated from years of binding

				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>a superficial question, but to me it was a strong and surprising
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>image.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The films of Chinese model operas and ballets look strange to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>us as well: the colors are extraordinarily bright, and the action
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>appears simple and a bit overwrought. We are not used to seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>filmed stage plays, hence the settings are not as “realistic” as
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>in our wester films. We are stuck on the outside, looking in at
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>another culture. Coming from this perspective, l’ve tried to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>understand and find out about the changes Chinese women
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>experienced after the revolution and how these model works
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>were made.
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>In two films that I saw “Red Detachment of Women” and
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>“The White-Haired Girl,” the main characters were women who
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>had been severely oppressed under Feudalism. Both women,
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>through a different series of events, fight back first through flight
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and then through individual acts of revenge against those who
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>have harmed them. In these two plays, the heroines come to
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>believe that they will not become liberated alone and so they join
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in the revolution. They are characters of survival who become
				<lb facs='#facs_28_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>transformed into characters of resistance and vision.

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>seventeen years of revolutionary rule. This

				<lb facs='#facs_29_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>call “the birthmarks” of the old society. Such

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was one such brigade. Our skills included

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_8_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>dancing, devil-sticks, clowning, mime and

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We were inspired by the dream of a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>non-sexist, non-commercial circus in which
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>women would be more than pretty assis
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tants to mostly male-designed feats of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>strength. We aspired to be the collective
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>creators of work that would use our varied
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>skills to express ideas we believed in. This
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>is how we envisioned the first women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>circus-theatre ensemble.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Motivated by a desire to express soli-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>darity with the Nicaraguan people, we
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>planned a three-month trip: two months
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>of rehearsal in Mexico and a three-week
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tour of Nicaragua. The seven performers
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and musicians who made up The Wom
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>en’s Circus met in Mexico on January 8,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>1987. We chose to meet in Mexico for
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>several reasons. First, it was relatively
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>neutral ground for work, being none of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>our homes; second, the warm weather
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>allowed us to rehearse outside in winter
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and avoid the high cost of U.S. studio
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>rentals; third, we knew of a beautiful
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Mexican town complete with resident in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ternational theatre and women’s commu
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>nities; and finally, it provided us with a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>way to begin to familiarize ourselves with
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Latin American culture and the Spanish
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>language on a daily basis. Our cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>disorientation, and the fact that we were
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>gringas in a Third World country, were
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>realities that we became more and more
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>aware of.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The performers were Debbie Davis,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Sara Felder, and Christina Lewis from
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>San Francisco, and Jennifer Miller and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Susan Seizer from New York City. The
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>musicians were Leslie Lind from San
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Francisco and Camilla Saunders from Lon
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>don, England. (Delfin, whom we met in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Tepoztlan, Mexico, joined us on tour as
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>our videographer. A tape of her video
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>documentation of the trip is forthcoming.)
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Of the performers, two had previously
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>worked as professionals in U.S. circuses.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The other three performers held their
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>primary skills in dance, theater and mime.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Two had been to Nicaragua previously, in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>1983 and 1984. Within the group, there
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>were prior working relationships, but for
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>each of us in the group, there were at least
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>two other members whom we had never
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>met before. We agreed to make all deci-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>sions collectively with no director.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Creating the show together was diffi
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>cult for some interesting reasons. First,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>we were restricted in our ability to include
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>verbal material by the fact that none of us
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_10_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>was truly fluent in Spanish. We weren’t
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>conversant enough to emcee our show or
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to interject comments or dialogue within
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>pieces. The more theatrical pieces had to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>be non-verbal, which severely narrowed
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>our aesthetic options. Secondly, cross
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cultural performing of material that is
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>meant to be humorous can be tricky.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>(Does a physical comedy bit about a vac

				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>in Nicaragua as in California?) Thirdly, we
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>didn’t know who our audience would be.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Our itinerary was being planned by a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sponsoring organization in Nicaragua, and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>we hadn’t been able to contact them dur-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ing our time in Mexico (phones, like
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>vacuum cleaners, were not to be taken for
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>granted.) We hoped we’d be performing
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>for kids, families, women’s groups, and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>political and cultural groups. We wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>our show to offer something to each of
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>these audiences and to provide new im
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ages of women to Nicaraguan women and
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>girls. We also didn’t know where we’d be
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>performing—outdoors, indoors, in cities
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>or rural areas—nor did we know what
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>kind of ground or floor we would be
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>performing on. And finally, we were work-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ing under time pressure. A true collective
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ensemble takes many years to develop;
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and we were starting from scratch in creat
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ing a group aesthetic, with only two
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>months to do it.
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Ultimately, the show never took on
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>one solid form, but, rather, was a loose
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>collection of pieces some or all of which we
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>performed on any given day according to
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>circumstances. Its shape, however, re
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>mained approximately the same. We began
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>with a parade entrance of stilts and music,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>hoola-hoops, ribbon twirling, crystal balls,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>etc. Then began a series of smaller-group
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>pieces, all accompanied by live and mostly
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>original music. A sweet clown mimes loves-
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>me-loves-me not. Three playful kids do a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>club-juggling act. There’s a street kid
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>whose radio turns into cigar boxes that
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>hang magically in the air. Then our most
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>fluent Spanish speaker presents a theatri
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>cal/political text, with juggling imagery in
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the background, which tells about union
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>izing in a cannery. There’s a manic clown
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>who rushes in on a unicycle only to be
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>attacked by her own hand, and a sleepy
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>clown who does a slack-rope act with a
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ballerina. Our dancer presents a classical
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Bharatanatyam prayer dance from India,
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and then a two-headed juggler and her dog
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>appear. The order of these pieces often
				<lb facs='#facs_32_r_13_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>changed, and there was frequently a dixie

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>land tune or two somewhere in between.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>We ended with a fiery finale of torch
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>juggling, torch swinging and burning devil-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sticks set to the music of drums and wood
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>flute. Our encore was a short, original
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>three-part harmony verse sung in Spanish
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>articulating our political position.* When
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ever possible, we asked the audience to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>share a song with us after the show, and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>several ballads were sung in this way.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>We presented preliminary versions of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>this show in Tepoztlan and Mexico City,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>both indoors and outdoors, before we took
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>it on the tour. These performances were
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>well received by children and the theatre
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>community alike. At the Zocalo Plaza in
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Mexico City we encountered a phenome
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>non which later became familiar. When
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>we performed outdoors, people were as
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>fascinated by our presence there as they
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>were by our show, and they gathered to

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>took and remained for the entire show.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This is very different from street perform

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>doing. Here, we were the event.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The day after our Zocalo Plaza show,

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>foreigners. It was then that I began to

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>there because we agree that the U.S. should
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>get out—that Nicaraguan resources should
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>be used for Nicaraguan lives. The irony
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was an uncomfortable one.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We stayed at the Hotelito for two to

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>weeks. This itinerary came as a surprise to
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>us. We had said to the ASTC in our
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>original communications that we would
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>perform wherever we were needed, though
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>we made a point of mentioning the kinds
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of groups we saw as particularly appropri

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>women’s militia training centers.” We had
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>expected the fact that we were an all
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women’s group to be understood as a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>feminist statement and taken into consid

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>think any of us were psychologically pre-

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>military. Our sponsors never saw our show
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>before they sent us out, though they said
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>they wanted to. The shortage of gasoline
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and the constantly changing nature of al
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>scheduling due to surprise Contra attacks
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>seemed likely causes. Yet none of this was
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>really discussed with us. We were told,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>for example, that we’d be picked up at
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>10:00 a.m. to do a show; then no one would
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>come by or call for us all day. We spent
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>several such interminable days of waiting
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>in Managua, during which time we coulc

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>We finally set out for the army bases
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>on March 10. We performed an average of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>one show a day to groups of soldiers that
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ranged in number from 30 to 700. These
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>were almost exclusively male audiences,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>over 75% of whom were teenagers. The

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>largest audiences of the entire tour, was
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>also one of the most memorable. These
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>soldiers had just returned from two years
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>stationed in the mountains, were to be

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and came to our show accompanied by all
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>species of mountain animals they had
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tamed: spotted deer, a baby wild boar, and
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>a full-sized macaw. The soldiers I spoke
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to that evening were all glad to be going
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>home the next day. But they were pre-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>pared to come back and fight whenever
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>they were next needed. They reiterated
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the 1987 Sandinista slogan l’d seen sten
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ciled on so many walls all over Nicaragua:
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Aqui no se rinde nadie,” (loosely trans-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lated, “We don’t give up.”) There were
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>other interactions with soldiers, however
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>that were less pleasant —the typical cat
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>calls, and the general feeling that we were
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>being looked upon as another species.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>frequently felt like a Bob Hope USO
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>showgirl, the trucked-in entertainment for
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the troops. And yet we were doing exactly
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>what we’d wanted to do—perform a show
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of our own creation for the Nicaraguan
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>people. The conflict stemmed mostly from
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>how isolated we felt in the all-male envi
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ronment of the military bases and camps
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Moreover, we felt frustration and sorrow
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>finding that seven years after the revolu-

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>to be fighters for a military defense, the

				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ety seemingly put on indefinite hold. In
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>terms more specific to our show, we found
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that certain numbers we’d prepared for a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>general audience were rendered inappro
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>priate by this military reality. Some pieces
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>were simply too “feminine” to perform in
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>an environment that wasn’t feminist. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of our work explored a sensual quality of
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>movement that, unfortunately, proved too
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>difficult to present.
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>During our two weeks of army tour-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ing, we did perform four shows for civil
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ian audiences—though after a while the
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>distinction began to seem like a strange
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>one, since many of the soldiers were so
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>clearly boys just off the farm, while many
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>of the civilians had been all too intimately
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>involved with war. What made the great-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>est difference was performing once again
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>for people of all ages and both genders in
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>public spaces. The shows took place in a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>town dance hall on a Saturday night, a
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>town meeting hall on a Sunday morning,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>outdoors on a town commons mid-week,
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>and in a park on a Sunday evening. These
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>audiences contained children who had
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>never seen any form of theatrical enter-
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>tainment, live or on film. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_33_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>challenging and appreciative audiences who

			<pb n='34'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>responded quite differently than U.S. au
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>diences, with a quality of rapt attention
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and no pre-defined code of interaction/non
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>interaction with us as performers. The
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>park show was a completely wild affair,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>with jugglers popping up here, a unicyclist

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ing us at every turn. This was really the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>only show of the wholę tour where we just
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>let our structures completely burst open
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and just used our circus skills in spontane
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ous interactions.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>On our tour, we were free to talk with
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>anyone we met. We were limited only by
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>our own command of the language. These
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>conversations were the source of most of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>our information on the trip, as we did not
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>have, as many foreign brigades do, prear

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>In this way, our situation sharply con

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>educational brigades we met. These were
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>mainly professionals—doctors, profes
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sors, nurses, journalists, a smattering of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>students and the retired wealthy—who
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>paid an American organization in the States
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>for their trips in advance, and traveled
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>with guides. They had tightly scheduled
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>visits to hospitals, schools, cultural facili
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ties, and government officials every day,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and frequently heard speeches while being

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>people for whom it was important to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>provide many views of Nicaraguan life.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Their questions were addressed from many
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>different angles.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Our trip was very different in nature,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>as we were a performing brigade whose

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>However, while we were there we felt that
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>it would have been to everyone’s advan

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>ers. Our disappointment was that we were
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>treated solely as entertainers rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>cultural workers in a broader sense. Cer

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>market. We spoke without translators.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>And the information we gleaned came in a
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>rhythm that was entirely unfamiliar to us.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>On the other hand, the tour brigades
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>organized their itineraries themselves, from
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the States, and ended up getting just what
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>they’d started out thinking they would
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>get. Though it might have seemed and felt
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>otherwise at the time, I suspect that in the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>final analysis the picture they got was less
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>complete. For as far as I could tell, their
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>trip gave them nothing of the feeling of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>what it’s like to live in a different culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>During our third and final week, also
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>filled with much waiting, we performed in
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Managua at three public schools, kinder
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>garten through junior high levels. These
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>were large, co-ed audiences where the
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sheer numbers of children made work
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>shops we’d originally intended virtually
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>impossible. We did, however, manage to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>give ten or so children a chance to walk on
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>stilts. And after much group conflict over
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>how to give material aid, we left a supply
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of over fifty balls with the school at which
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>we presented our final performance, a
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>school for orphans of the war and psycho
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>logically disturbed children. We wished
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>throughout that we’d had an unlimited
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>supply of such material aid to distribute
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>after every performance; the fact that we
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>didn’t brought up some more political
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>issues. A few of us, myself included, felt it
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>was better to give something to some than
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>nothing at all. Others felt that unless we
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>could give equally to all, we’d be recreat-
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ing a capitalist scenario of haves and have
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>nots. Again, I think the issue centered
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>around a cultural assumption, in this case,
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>that the children we gave balls to would
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>not share, that they would see them as
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>their own, and hoard them. That’s a
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>particulary common way that North Amer
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ican children behave. But unless we have
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>confidence in the children’s abilities to
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>work out ball-sharing amongst them
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>selves, in an environment largely free of

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>giving a little to several groups wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>instead to give all the material aid at one

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>notion that never convinced me that any of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the kids we’d met and juggled for would
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>ever see one of our balls again in their
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>town). Evidently, when the two of our
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>group had last been in Nicaragua some
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>years before, they had felt there was a
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>strong party line related to this question.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>It is my pleasure to report that in 1987 no
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>such strict “party line” exists, and that
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>when asked, our ASTC chaperone said he
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>thought it would be nice for the kids to get
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>any amount of balls from us, directly, and
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that that way they might connect the gift
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>more clearly to our visit.
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>All during our stay the bulk of our
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>gear was housed in buildings on the site of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the Nicaraguan National Circus, which
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>provided us with sporadic opportunities
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>to view the extremely talented members of
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>this circus in rehearsal. A circus union
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>was created after the triumph in 1979 that
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>incorporated the best of the small family
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>circuses into one National Circus. There
				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>were three Soviet professors taking charge

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>what we saw. We presented the more

				<lb facs='#facs_34_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>balls, a rope, and an acrobatic mat.

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>a Country and a House? Initially, we went
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>to understand the conflict there— what
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>caused the division between those who
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>desire self-sovereignty and independence
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>from Britain and those who need to keep
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Ireland loyal to the crown? Further, we
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>wanted to know what it was like to live in
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Northern Ireland and what the day-to-day
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>lives of the women were about.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>This conflict has been dismissed as an

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>thought some answers might be found in
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the streets and in the homes; we thought
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the stories of these women might reveal
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>some threat that merited the conspiracy

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>walked down from South Belfast through
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the reinforced army-patrolled iron gates of
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the city center. This is where everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>shops. We walked on to West Belfast,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>always looking through the focused eye of
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the camera. We took in the streets and
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>observed the people—watching their faces
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and how, in their rapid stride, they dismiss
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>the presence of the security forces, army
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and police. No one bothers to ask if you
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>are Protestant or Catholic in this area.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>We met and spoke with women and

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>and ones with severe unemployment. Most

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>presence in their lives? How can one be

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>make it through the day? What issues
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>were of concern to them—how were they
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>affected by the cutbacks, the lack of com

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>They learned to trust us as women

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Here is our major point of connection,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>discovered through countless discussions:
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>state militarism, with all its hostility and
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>factional violence, is as intact in Belfast as
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>it is in the urban core cities of the States.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>We are women looking beneath the public
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and ideological surface, looking for stories
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of women who experience violence in their
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>daily lives, whether in Belfast or in our
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>own country. These women expressed a
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sense of immediacy and passion in their
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>efforts to enact social change, as they take
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a stake in the very survival of their com
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>munity, redefine their own participation,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and move to create lives for themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and their children.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Both Republican Catholic women and
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Loyalist Protestant women have seen their
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>husbands imprisoned, in some cases as
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>members of either the Irish Republican
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Army or the loyalist Ulster Defence Force,
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>both state-outlawed paramilitary forces.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Based on these alliances, their views of the
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>struggle were radically different.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>For the most part, the Protestant
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>women accepted the status quo. They
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>preferred to let the state take care of the
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>troubles, although, of course, they wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>their men out of prison. They saw Catho-
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lics as irresponsible and useless, sponging
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>off the state.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Catholic women, those associated with
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Sein Fein in particular, felt more of a need
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>to take a political role and educate them-
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>selves. Alienated by government cutbacks
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and the constant surveillance of their lives
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>by the army, they were taking hold of
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>housing issues, jobs, health care and pro
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>viding their children with alternatives to
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the violence in the streets. After all, this
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>was a generation of children growing up
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>knowing only violence. To present them
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>with a different reality was to help free
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the country.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Josephine tells of her struggles to make
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>life better for herself and her children:
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>They did offer courses at the fam-
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>ily center—they were very basic.
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>They taught you how to be a better

				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>better, etc. But I wanted more
				<lb facs='#facs_37_r_5_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>than that. The family center in

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>for themselves. And so I found

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>They more or less tried to force us
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>back into the leisure-time classes.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Soon after, we met women not aligned
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with any political parties who were active
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>in the progressive radical feminist and
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>lesbian community in Northern Ireland.
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Some were editors of the feminist monthly
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Womenews. Others were active in women’s

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>They came together with other women

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ment. Our ideas about how to bring these
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>stories together were beginning to take
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>shape. The possibilities are restricted when
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>women feel they can’t speak for them
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>selves, or fear censorship or intentional
				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>misquotation. Women in Belfast are weary

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>as governed by terrorism. In order for

				<lb facs='#facs_38_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>trust us. They had to be assured that we

				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>had identity problems. In this country the rubric “community arts” has
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>often been used to describe the work of local arts agencies—the Anytown
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Arts Council or the Some City Arts Commission—which can include things
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>as far-ranging as publishing a community calendar of events, maintaining
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a gallery or theater, offering classes, giving grants, and providing equip
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ment and advice for local arts events. In the Reagan era, this usage has
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>been dying out. Local arts agencies have been persuaded that the word
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>community” smacks too much of funkiness, amateurism, even social rele
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>vance. They’ ve taken to callingthemselves“ local arts agencies” (or“LAAS”),
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>as we do in this essay.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The label “community arts”” has another usage, however. It refers to
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the work of artists who align themselves with a defined community, who
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>see their work as the product of collaboration with non-artists, and whose
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>aim is as much to involve people in building and asserting their own cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>identity as to create a particular work of art. In contrast, more conven
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tional artists may see their roles in terms of creating works—pictures, ob
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>jects, environments, plays, songs, dances—and other people’s roles as
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>consuming or experiencing these works. Certain forms are associated with
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>community arts work because they are public and, for the most part, col
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>laborative. These include murals, posters, street art, street theater, oral
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>history, demonstrations, participatory theater, community festivals. But there
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is no form of arts work that is intrinsically community art. What defines
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>community art is the approach.
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>It is in this second sense that the British refer to community arts, as do
				<lb facs='#facs_43_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>people in most other English-speaking countries. It is also in this sense that

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>periods when the public outcry for change outweighed the estab
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>lishment’s self-protective impulses. The first boom was during
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the ’30s, when the federal cultural programs of the New Deal
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>were created to soften the effects of the Great Depression. The
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>second was during the ’60s and ’70s, when the federal govern-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ment invested large sums of money in social programs designed
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>to stave off “urban unrest” and alleviate unemployment.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>During both periods, community arts programs were seen as
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>good expenditures of public money: artists’ unemployment was
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>astronomical. Artists were grateful to have useful work for small
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>salaries; they were resourceful and inventive and made a big splash
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>without much in the way of equipment and supplies. The result-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ing programs involved a lot of people; they made visible differ-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>ences in community life; and they generated lots of good-looking
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>products like murals and plays.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Unfortunately, community artists were so glad to get the money
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that they didn’t really notice that these funding programs kept
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>them from thinking about the future. The money came in dribs
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and drabs with lots of paperwork attached. No one got enough to
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>build for the future—just enough to keep a particular project
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>going for a few months, even a year or two, and to keep people
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>busy filling out applications and reports.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Both these periods were also times of great social ferment. All
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>kinds of issues and causes flourished, and each one had a cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>dimension that gave community arts work meaning and purpose.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>During the ’30s, labor and political organizations provided an
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>infrastructure that supported cultural work, with publications,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>theaters, camps, and film projects. Money was hard to come by,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>but living was cheap in that depressed period.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Strong links with civil rights and peace movements character-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ized community arts work during the boom of the ’60s and ’70s.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>For instance, the women’s movement understood that the cul-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>tural dimension of its work was as important as any other: it was
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>necessary to redefine aesthetic standards, to purge language of its

				<lb facs='#facs_45_l' n='N001'/>sexism, to the public telling of formerly private stories;
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>and community arts work had a vital part to play in these tastes.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>Civil rights movements in Black, Asian, Latino and Native Amer-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>ican communities were also saturated with cultural action and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>cultural struggle. And the peace movement was wedded to a coun-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>terculture based on the same two fundamental ideas that fuel com-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>munity arts today: opposition and prefiguration. The impoverish-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>ment of the dominant culture necessitated construction of hu
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>mane alternatives, brick by brick. Again, people didn’t have a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>of money, but inflation hadn’t hit yet either. Groups could find
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>modest resources through government-financed social service and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>employment programs; communal living cut their costs; and move-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>ment values helped keep them honest about how they spent the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>money.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>Enter the ’80s
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>Today’s situation couldn’t be more different. The Left is weak
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>and in disarray. It has declined into single-issue organizing, usu
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>ally leaving artists with very subsidiary decorative roles to play
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>—performing at benefits, designing colorful publicity materials,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>creating props for demonstrations. There is no alternative infra
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>structure to support community arts work. The unions which
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>contribute to cultural work can be counted on one hand. Not
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>even five fingers are needed to add up the movement organizations
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>that offer anything more than a chance to work for free on pack-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>aging a worthy cause.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N026'/>But the worst blow has been the withdrawal of government
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>money since Reagan took office, foreshadowed by “belt-tightening
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>measures such as California’s Proposition 13, which cut funds for
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>education, libraries and arts work along with money for housing
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N030'/>roads and other elements of physical infrastructure.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>The problem is that community arts is naturally and ideally a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N032'/>public responsibility. By and large, it doesn’t turn a buck. It doesn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>offer business patrons the chance to associate their images with
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>red plush and champagne. It is far less likely to touch the lives of
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>the rich than to reach the people who feed, clothe and clean up
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>after them. Its benefits are collective and communitarian. Even
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>the benefits that an individual derives from community arts are
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>reached through collective action.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>The Right is fond of talking about the private sector and its

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>other “market niches” for community arts besides government
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>funding—why not earn the money by selling products and serv-
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>ices? But in reality, our economy makes it very difficult to com

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>income.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N047'/>Untold dollars, often exceeding the cost of production, are

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N052'/>same expenditures. At most, community arts groups could try
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N053'/>turning themselves into small-scale commercial ventures, but the
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N054'/>price they pay is the diversion of their attention away from the

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>companies and museums. Only a small proportion of U.S. foun
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>dations make arts support of any kind a priority; very few of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>these focus on community arts work at all. Like the program

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>calls the “culture-industrial complex,” in which people work for

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>agency, then climb another rung of the career ladder to a bigger

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with and sympathetic to community arts work. With foundations

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>The times are tough indeed. And the one strategy that has been
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>touted as a rescue for community arts has been short-sighted and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wrong-headed. “Institutionalization” is the medicine most often
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>prescribed. The prescription has been couched in language pep
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>pered with calls for “stability” and “professionalization.” It is a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>bankrupt strategy, not because it’s wrong to build institutions but
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>because the actual aim of the institutionalization campaign has
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>been to saturate leading community arts groups with a whole set
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of values that co-opt and transform the work, burying its essential
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>commitments to opposition and prefiguration.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>The “institutionalization” campaign has worked liked this.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Funds, both public and private, have offered community arts
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>groups the chance to compete for relatively substantial grants
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>—substantial as the usual financing of the field goes. Very few of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>these grants are awarded, and the application process is always
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>time-consuming and labor-intensive, so even the decision to apply
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>necessitates a change in direction.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Institutionalization grants are intended to subsidize major steps
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>toward “stability” and “professionalization.” For instance, a col-
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>lective might use the money to transform itself into a more stan-
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dard arts organization, paying salaries to a development directoi
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and a marketing director. Or theater that has had a more personal
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>relationship with its community might adopt the conventional
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>season-subscription approach, spending the money on glossy
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>direct-mail pieces and paid advertising. Along with the grant comes a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>load of management consulting assistance provided by the fund
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and aimed at helping the grantee adjust to the new rules and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>build a new organizational culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Whatever the specifics, entering the institutionalization arena
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>means accepting certain dominant values traditionally anathema

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>model of organization. Collectives and cooperatives are out, boards
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>of directors are in—with bankers, corporate executives and other
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>establishment types the preferred additions to the board.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Thus the price of receiving this life-saving money is to allow
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the organization’s purpose to be reshaped—however subtly—by
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>people who have probably had no prior contact and no sympathy
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>with the radical ideas from which the organization grew.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>for success. Instead, they are compelled to struggle to justify thein

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>naive desire to be friendly, helpful, and savvy, being persuaded to

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>and Luzem counties and became familiar

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>scars. I decided to focus on a site visible
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>from a popular and busy route and quickly
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>began running into an unexpected prob
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>lem. After locating what seemed to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>possible project site, I would then go to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the assessor’s office to locate the owner-of-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>record. The owner-of-record would turn
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>out to be, not the current owner at all, but
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>one from a few property transfers back.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>This was especially true where a coal
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>company had gone bankrupt and sold off
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>its properties (Glen Alden). The area had

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>that is, go to a known land owner, private

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of reclamation (as mentioned earlier, rec

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and asked about the use of a site for a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>reclamation art project. When I explained

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>was happy to show me several possibilities

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>would then be compacted and graded
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>creating a good opportunity for a project.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>I made a preliminary proposal for a ser-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>pentine vineyard dependent on results of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>soil tests. The city planner then presented
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my proposal to the Wilkes-Barre Fine
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Arts Commission, an agency that was set

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a full presentation of my proposal was
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>made, followed by discussion and a vote
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>on whether to support the project. The
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>commission voted for support which meant
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>applying for grant money, and the local

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the area a chance to respond. The pro

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a commission representative was informed

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the openness of the whole procedure and

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>160-acre private tract in the Storrs Pit. He
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>wanted his land reclaimed and that after
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>noon we walked through the site. Siniawa
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>thought I should also see the huge hazard
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ous pit in the process of being graded by
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the Department of Environmental Re-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sources (DER). This was the operation I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>had seen from the highway. From the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>crest of the spoils bank above the pit I saw
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>a hideous scar being converted into a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>beautiful valley. This site was twenty-five
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>hundred feet long and enclosed on two
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>sides by sixty-foot banks. The highway
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>boundary of Siniawa’s land sloped down
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>into the Storrs Pit in the form of a hun
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>dred-foot highwall parallel to the banks
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>being reclaimed by the DER. Both sites,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>together comprising three long banks,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>were visible from U.S. 6. I decided to try
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>to do complementary projects for the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>valley and single slope. On the private site
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>I would have the opportunity to design
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>both the grading and planting, on the

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I designed a serpentine vineyard for

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>plastic forks. She thinks the plastic forks
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>are beautiful, with lush daubs of red and
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>gold and yellow paint over them. She
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>thinks of mouths, hundreds of mouths,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>one for each fork. And then she looks at
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>all the tines of all the forks, and they look
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>like weapons.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>people to come here and take part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>temple away with them. She also likes to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>feed people. In front of each colander she
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>places a brick with a nest of steel wool on
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>it. Fetish objects for the pagan temple.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>She likes the circle of the nest on the

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>think again of her lover’s body, almost
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>covered with little wiry hairs. His hair is
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>one of the most fascinating things about
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>him. She has always been embarrassed

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>to be able to watch them. She thinks of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the millions of people all over the city who
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>are, at this moment, either entering or
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>leaving buildings. She imagines watching
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>them all, like a great choreographed dance,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>or like a football game with millions of

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Some of them are both frightening and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>silly at the same time. Like heads of state.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>You Fool&quot; just barely visible. Her neck
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and her hands and her feet are caked
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in dirt. She circles the temple several
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>times, hopping lightly from one foot to
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>another like a boxer, always facing the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>fountain as it it were her opponent. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lips move silently, outlining the words
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of a private conversation. An old man
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>notices her and hands her a cookie:
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>You wake up dreaming you’re asleep in
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the fridge, /there&apos;s so much white space

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>cookie. Then she scrunches up the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>paper into a little ball and puts it, too,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>in her mouth.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Another woman walks right into
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the temple. She is very tall and black
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and moves like a dancer or a queen.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>She leans over and takes a fortune
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>cookie: My whole life is like making a
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>name for myself in a foreign country.“
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>As she leaves, she dips her hand in the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>colander for one more cookie. One for
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the road. As she reaches the edge of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>the park, before stepping out onto the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>street, she reads it: What Noah

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Crystal Field—I was a choreographer and we
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>did concerts. In 1960 I did a piece called
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>“The Clock” that was funny, and at the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>first performance the audience laughed
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>hysterically every minute but at the next
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>performance they hardly laughed at all,
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and I thought maybe it was the way I was

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>acting lessons. From the minute I started
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to study acting I realized it was much
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>more exciting to me than dance.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>FB-What was the impulse that made you

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>CF—I think the idea of having my own
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>theater came from my dance background.
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I always thought I would be a dancer for a

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>company and when I got old I would
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>teach. You know repertory is a wonderful

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>you see. Generally speaking, it’s 525 a
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>performance, two performances a week

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>words since professional is usually defined
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>as someone who does something for a

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>velous. It’s true they don’t have a wide
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>range but that’s because they haven’t
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>worked to get a wide range. Within the

				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>real and they aren’t stuck with all those
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>horrible actorisms. The actors we take
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>into the street think a lot. They read the
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>newspapers and know what’s going on in
				<lb facs='#facs_56_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the world. They care about the story they’re

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>CF-Yes, no doubt about it. I love the

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>photographs were surprised to find two

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was Koudelka’s work, photographs of
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Gypsies from all parts of Europe, taken
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>over many years. In the cafe alongside the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>gallery were more photographs of Gypsies,
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>but these had all been taken and processed
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>over the previous few months by a group

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The novelty of the second exhibition at-
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tracted much of the attention of the gal
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>lery clientele, and they gave many favor-
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>able comments. The reaction I remember
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>most clearly, however, came from a re

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>she said, “I could do that myself.&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>The morning following the private view-

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>their children’s exhibition. It was the first
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>time any of them had been in there.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>remarkable.

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>comments on the photographs, making

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>and displaying enormous pride in the
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>children’s achievements. The young chil
				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>dren took advantage of the novelty of

				<lb facs='#facs_60_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>The idea grew from a photographic proj-

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>on a piece of waste ground, under threat
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of eviction. They had no legal place to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>camp, though by law the County Council
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>should have provided an official site for
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>them. They have been campaigning for
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>several years for proper provision to be
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>made for them. Meanwhile they camp
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>without security or proper facilities, in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>appalling conditions, anywhere they can
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>The major obstacle to site provision is
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the negative stereotype of Gypsies held by
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>housedwellers. Housedwellers are liable
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to get a distorted view of the Gypsy way of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>life, if they get one at all. The official
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>camp sites which exist tend to be tucked
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>away in isolated or industrial areas, away
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>from other residents, screened from pub
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>lic view. The families strictly maintain
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>their privacy, aware of and keeping away
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>from the house dweller’s gaze and hostility
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>wherever possible. Beyond work arrange
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ments there are few opportunities for
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ordinary social contact between house
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>dwellers and Travelers. The teenage girls
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>are kept under close family control.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The general public sees only the unoffi

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>roadside verges, on any available space.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>These tend to be untidy as there are no
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sanitary or rubbish disposal facilities. Also,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the space outside the trailer is used as a
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>work area, for sorting scrap, cleaning
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>metal, and so on. The startling contrast of
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the inside of the trailers (the only space the

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>onto the families by opposing official sites
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>I had been working as a teacher with the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Gypsy families in the city for several years,
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>trying to ensure that the children have
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>access to education despite the lack of an
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>official campsite. I wanted to work on an
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>educational project of some kind which
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>would focus on the dreadful conditions in
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>which the families were obliged to live. I
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>hoped that, indirectly, this would be a

				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>decent site.
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>At the same time I had been approached
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>by an art student, Sara Hannant, who as
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>part of her course work was expected to
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>initiate an art project in a local commu
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>nity. She was keen to learn more about the
				<lb facs='#facs_61_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Gypsies in order to base her work within
			</p>
			<pb n='62'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>this group. She needed an introduction to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the families. We discussed the idea of a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>photographic project and it seemed fa
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>vourable from various points of view. The
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>teenagers were very interested in photo
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>graphs, but they had not previously had
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the chance to learn the process. Sara could
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>come into the group primarily as a techni
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cian, an enabler for the project, not an
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>intruder. Photography seemed the ideal
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>vehicle to me for the site statement. So we
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>put the suggestion to the group of teenag-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ers; they were very keen to take some
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>photographs and learn the process of de
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>veloping and printing. But my idea for the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>subject matter was rejected straightaway.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>No one wanted to focus on the mud, the

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and storytelling, accompanied by the pho

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>graphs, but now they were being given the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>opportunity to take control of the process
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>themselves. They could choose where and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>how to photograph themselves and they
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>could follow the stages right through to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the final prints. They seized the chance to
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>make their own images, to represent
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>themselves.

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>girl decided how she wanted to present
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>herself, which aspects of her home, her

				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>thing came out black because light was
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>getting into the room and the safe light
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was faulty, the results were more impres
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sive than any of us had imagined. The
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>girls had captured a sense of themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and they were delighted. Their achieve-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ment went beyond individual prints. Seen
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>as a group of photographs, the pictures
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>gave a posititive identity to this small
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>group of Gypsies.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>At that stage of the project we discovered
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that Koudelka’s photographs were to be
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>shown in the city later in the year. The
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>coincidence was too good to be ignored, so
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>we approached the Arts Centre with the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>idea of holding a simultaneous exhibition
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of the local Gypsy photographs. Our sug-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>gestion was taken up and approved. We
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>had just a few weeks to prepare and mount
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the prints and work on texts to accompany
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>them. The girls decided to write briefly
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>about their daily lives as reflected in their
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>photographs. They described typical days
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>for themselves, their occupations and pre
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>occupations. They wrote of taking and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>printing the pictures. These texts, exten
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>sions and amplifications of the images,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>stood alongside the photographs.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>By now I had realized that the statement
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>the girls had insisted on making for and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>about themselves was far more powerful
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>an assertion of their right to maintain thein
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>own culture and its richness than any I
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>would have contrived. After initial embar
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>rassment that they were on show to whom-
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ever might walk into the Arts Centre,
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>publicly presenting their pictures gave the
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Traveler girls a greater confidence and
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>pride in themselves. They began to take a
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>professional interest in the images by
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Koudelka. They recognized the quality of
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>his photographs and despaired of ever
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>being able to achieve as much themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Yet they also understood that they had
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>been regarded as worthy of displaying
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>their work alongside his. Their commu
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>nity had asserted its right to be given space
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>among other communities, to be seen on
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>its own terms. It was that dignity, a pride
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>in the community, that the parents carried
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>with them when they found the confidence
				<lb facs='#facs_62_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>to walk into the Arts Centre to see the

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>That afternoon as Susan began to read aloud she cried after al
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>most every sentence she spoke. Her wavy, long red hair tumbled
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>down her face as she bent her head to read, and several times she
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>stopped and said, “I can’t go on.” The supportive silence of ev-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>eryone in the room formed a safety net under her very young and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>yet very old small feet. She told her story, of how at twelve she
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>was raped and beaten by the houseboy who raised her while her
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>wealthy father and professional mother worked. She was sent to a
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>school for unwed mothers for nine months and then gave the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>baby up for adoption. “Maybe I had my ten kids after that be-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cause I always wanted to make up for that loss. I wanted to kcep
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the baby but my mother said, No, it would kill your father.’ I
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>mailed him letters from Canada where I was supposed to be, but
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>he never knew I was here in the States all the time. He still
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>doesn’t know to this day.” She laughed and cried at the same
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>time. Tears streamed down her pale white skin. Someone handed
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>her a toilet tissue roll and she looked up to smile thank you and
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>broke into tears again.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Through the body of writing created by the women inmates
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>in the Bright Fires Creative Writing Program at California Reha-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>bilitation Center (CRC) over the past eight years, I have discovered
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>a relation between child abuse and the women’s incarceration.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>In 1979 when I first began working at CRC, (based 60 miles
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>east of Los Angeles), it was primarily a minimal-security state
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>prison for women and men whose crimes were heroin abuse, ad
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>diction and other drug-related crimes. By 1983, CRC had be
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>come a medium-security prison where women felons who had
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>been sentenced for forgery, burglary, and armed robbery were
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>also housed.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>When I first began at CRC, I had no idea that at least 90% of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the women I would work with were victims of child abuse. Nor
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>was I aware that at least 75% were victims of sexual child abuse.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Child abuse, because it so often leads to self abuse, has played
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>a major role in the lives of the women at CRC. As an adult, self
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>abuse may take the form of drug addiction, suicide, mental ill
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ness, and/or crime. Thus, child abuse is an integral part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>road to prison for most women with whom I have worked.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Susan is an example. She’d been using drugs for twenty-five
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>years, had been in and out of prisons for fourteen of these. She
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>told me, “T’ve always been very scared, very closed, afraid to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>show or expose myself in any way. I only broke through this bar
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>rier after the time I broke down in the writing workshop, the time
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you made me write that autobiography piece that exposed my
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>shields. Once I saw my shields and what it was that had impris
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>oned me all these years, I wanted to break free.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>As she finished, Norma spoke up. “I know that took a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>courage for you to write that piece, Susan. Believe me, I know.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Norma sat in the soft grey chair directly across from Susan. Even
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>though they had both been in the workshop for some time, they
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>had not been friendly toward each other nor did they interact
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>outside the workshop. But in that moment Norma raised her grey-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>green eyes and directly contacted Susan’s blue ones and said, I
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was molested by my stepfather at ten and I never told anyone till
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>I was thirty-two years old. I just happened to see a show on TV
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>while I was at California Institute for Women (a higher-security
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>prison). I realized it was very common. Then I couldn’t stop crying
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>for weeks. I would cry if someone asked me my name. It’s okay to
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>cry about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>In that moment I realized why Norma had previously been so
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>stubborn when I asked her to continue the childhood stories she
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>had started writing earlier. “You’Il never get me to write about
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>that painful childhood,” she’d said, her eyes sparking. “It’s too
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>hard to tell about that.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Earlier, Marcia too had stated that her girlfriend’s father had
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>clutched at her ten-year-old breasts but “it didn’t bother me.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>She had said it as dispassionately as though she had just declared,
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>“my pencil is broken.” I said nothing then but noted how totally
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>emotionless she was, as though her years of being overweight had
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>wrapped her in a shroud and no one would ever be able to touch
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>her again.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>A composite of many creative forces was working in the Bright
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Fires Writing Program at the beginning of 1983. For the first
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>time in their lives the women involved felt free and safe enough in
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a group, albeit in prison, to say out loud the words that had been
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>forbidden them in the past. Up till now, the taboo against speak-
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ing about this demon was too strong. They had been forbidden
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>their voice until they didn’t know they had one.
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>As a poet, my work has always been involved with image

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>body symbology) to join me at CRC in doing creative visualiza-

				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>in writing, of crashing through barriers of depression. Marica was
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>then a perfect example of someone who needed to break through
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>her fears in order to explore her imagination and talent. She al
				<lb facs='#facs_64_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>lowed her imagination to discover FEAR, to give it a voice, as

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Marcia came into my office the next day flabbergasted. She sat
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>down and said. &quot;Please, can I read vou what I wrote after last
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>nicht&apos;s visualization?&quot; When she was through, she looked straight
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in my eves and said. &quot;I didn&apos;t realize it but all these vears I have
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>been pretending that none of this bothered me. Ijust kept slough
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ing it off as though it didn&apos;t make any difference. I had no idea
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that I was so profoundly affected by all that.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>&quot;Did vou ever tell vour mother about the neighbor fondling
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>vou?” I asked, curious to see the mother&apos;s role in her daughter&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>defense. Yes,&quot;&apos; she said. &quot;I did but she didn&apos;t do anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>What I was beginning to see was a pattern in which the girl&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>parents, especially her mother, didn’t protect her. Earlier Kandi.

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Then I remember the stinking smell of alcohol, a body crawling in my

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>froze. My God, it&apos;s him! I told him I had to go into the bathroom ana
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I got into it and locked the door. My stepfather kept beating on the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>door. This went on for about an hour and then I heard the back door
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>open. It was Mom. I screamed for her. All she said was, Whats the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>mauer?
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>In my conversations with Kandi she acknowledged that her mother
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>staved with her stepfather simply out of financial insecurity. We
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>held long discussions about how women in the ’50s felt trapped
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>It was more than the “stand by vour man” conflict. They had
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>married young and had no training or experience in the affairs in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the world. The mothers had learned no protection for themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>nor could they offer any to their daughters. Kandi&apos;s own mother
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>had been raped by her husband. Kandi wrote:
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Its been hard, Mom, I never had a childhood I could put on paper

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>It is precisely this confusion in the daughter’s mind that makes

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>correct or whether the incident was so terrible. As Alice Miller

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the family but also within her self. And because she cannot share her

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Kandi’s case. Marcia’s, and others’ revealed to me that there were
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>great schisms in mother-daughter relationships when the mothers
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>did nothing to protect their daughters, either by leaving the abu
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sive husband or by reporting him to the police, etc. They com
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>municated helplessness and victimization to their daughters, which
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sent the girls spiraling further into a world of isolation, loneliness,
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>autism in some cases, and, in others, running away. Kandi end

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I saw a repeated pattern modeled on the ancient Greek myth
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of Persephone and Demeter, which has been a central image in
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>writing of my work at CRC. The myth tells of the incredible
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>stress, sense of loss, sorrow, and pain that occur when a daugh
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ter is abducted from her mother at an innocent age and the mother
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is unable to do anything to protect her daughter from the rapist
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>kidnapper. Persephone is raped, taken from her mother into the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Underworld by Death (Pluto) while Demeter, “her anxious fright-

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Judith Herman wrote in her Colloquium on “Sexual Violence,

				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>It is clear that girls who are alienated from their mothers or who are
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>physically separated from their mothers for any length of time are at
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>much higher risk for all forms of sexual assault. In my own survey of
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>treatment programs for incest and child sexual abuse, one of the main
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>points of consensus was that if the family could be rebuilt at all, the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>key to recovery for the viciim and restoration of the family was the
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>mother-daughter relationship. Where that could be strengthened and
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>restored, the victims did well; where it could not, the victims had a
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>much harder time.
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Kandi wrote to her mother:
				<lb facs='#facs_65_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I love vou very much. Through my writing l&apos;m learning to accept my

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Marcia, on the other hand, came to Bright Fires not yet ready
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to tap into her anger at her mother or at the man who attempted
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to molest her. Her fear of allowing herself to go back and ac

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>was so great that she was in a prison of silence. Being silenced was
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>yet another form of abuse. Her body had become an insulating
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cocoon and a prison out of which she could not grow. She had
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>successfully suppressed her thoughts and feelings for so long that
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>she suffered from deep depressions which she named, “the feel-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ing,” as well as feelings of inner emptiness and lack of self-worth.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Heroin had been the only way she had found to relive the pain
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and simultaneously create another reality, albeit false and illusory
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>However, once Marcia was able to break through the emo
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tional hold of her past by putting it into words, she found a great
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>release of energy and creative drive. She felt she needed to create
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>a dramatic reading of her work in which Stephanie and I became
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the other character voices. This allowed Marcia to imaginatively
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>enact her confrontation with FEAR through her dramatic dia
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>logue. It revealed to her the power of the imagination to confront
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and conquer one’s inner demons. After that, she dropped her
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>little girl voice, an almost “Betty-Boop” quality of tone and mim-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>icry. It was as though she gave birth to a more mature self, not
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>yet a woman of twenty-four, but no longer a girl-child. She had
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>begun to escape the emotional cocoon that had frozen her at the
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>age of ten.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The process of creating a dramatic ritual out of Marcia&apos;s words
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>was not only a creative opening for Marcia but also for the entire
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Bright Fires group. As in Aristotle’s definition of drama, Marcia
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>had allowed the audience to experience a catharsis through her
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>words. While opening the door to confront her own demons, she
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>gave courage and space to others to speak up.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>This lifting of the voice was shown a month later when Deb-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>bie came in with a love poem thanking her present boyfriend for
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>staying by her in spite of all her past difficulties. Her piece was
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>vague and abstract. I could sense she was trying to articulate some
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>thing important.
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>No one in the assembled circle of fifteen knew what to say
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>since her meaning was so veiled. Without realizing what I was
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>touching, I rushed in and asked, “Could you just tell us what you
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>are trying to say and give us some concrete examples?” She began
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>to read the piece again and this time broke into a fit of tears as she
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>began to explain how she was molested at six by her mother’s
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>boyfriend. Everyone was stunned. Six years old! Yet everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>knew how unfortunately true this story was. Pat admitted she was
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>molested at eleven by her older brother and had never dared admit
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>that to anyone. Others told stories of being battered and abused
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>as wives or being emotionally abused and ridiculed as children
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>The next few weeks of writing were filled with poems and stories
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>inspired by Debbie’s courage in admitting her story in a group
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>setting. I wrote the following poem in response to that moment:

				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>“Will The Real Criminal Please Stand Up?” and got a burst of
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>applause. I then began to notice that whenever I read this particu-
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>lar piece to women in prison I always got resounding applause. I
				<lb facs='#facs_66_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>was tapping into their anger as well as their pain.

				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>heard him breathing deeply. My eyes opened just enough
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>to see my stepfather sitting naked in a chair by my bed. Ishut
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>my eyes tightly and lay trembling in the darkness, praying to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>God for help. I was sure that my stepfather could hear my heart
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>banging inside my chest. His breathing quickened, the noises
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>he made scared me. I thought he was having a fit and was
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>going to kill me.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>He made sure that I was never alone with my mother when
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>she was home. His eyes would narrow into an unspoken threat
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>when she would come home from the bar she worked at. My
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>mother worked nights so she was asleep most of the day By
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the time I got home from school she would be getting ready to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>go to work and usually be in a hurry as she had to walk three
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>miles into town.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>My stepfather slapped me around after she went to work.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>remember him making me pull my panties down so he could
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>spank me for being bad. I got spanked for a lot of things, like
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>sweeping the floor wrong. He was left-handed and l was
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>right-handed. But if he caught me sweeping the floor right
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>handed, I got spanked.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>After I cleaned the house he would make me bathe, while
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>he watched ... making sure that l’d get myself clean. Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>he would wash me himself ...just to be positively sure. Ihen he
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>would make me sit on his lap like a little girl. He would tell me
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>not to let boys touch me in my private places, touching them
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>himself so l’d know where he was talking about. Before sending
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>me to bed he would kiss me goodnight and push his tongue into
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>my mouth. If l jerked away he slapped me full across the face
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>for being mean to him when all he was doing was trying to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>good father to me
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>One morning after my mother came home from work she
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>found me passed out drunk on my bed with blood all over the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>sheets. My stepfather told her that l had tried to entice him and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>had put something up inside myself. They got into a fight in the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>living room. He was beating her up really bad. I grabbed o
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>frying pan and hit him until he let go of her. Imust have been
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>halt-crazy because he ran out the door with blood pouring from
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>his head. My mother lay thrashing and screaming on the floor
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>hysterical. I ran out the back door. I ran and ran and ran.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Another moment of revelation came months later when Norma
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>turned around to me in the Bright Fires office and said, “You
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>know it wasn’t just writing My New Daddy’ that released me
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>from shame and guilt. I realized, as a result of writing, that I am
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>not to blame for this crime.” She began to cry. “All these years I
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>have carried around the belief that this was my fault, that I was
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the guilty one, that somehow I caused this to happen. But how
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>could I be guilty of this? I was only eleven years old, just a child.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Is there no responsibility placed on the adults?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>The room felt very white to me that morning—like an Easter
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Sunday when the church is filled with white calla lilies and the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>priest wears white and gold vestments. Norma had achieved a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>new level of awareness through her writing: she was no longer
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>looking at her abuse through the eyes of a child. She was looking
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>at her life through the eyes of an adult woman. She was clearly an
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>example of Adrienne Rich’s notion of writing as “re-vision.” Rich
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>says in her critical book On Lies, Secrets, and Silence:
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Re-vision—the act of looking back, of seeing with fresh eyes, of enter-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ing an old text from a new critical direction—is for women more than
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>a chapter in cultural history: it is an act of survival. Until we can
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>understand the assumptions in which we are drenched we cannot know
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ourselves. And this drive to self-knowledge, for women, is more than a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>search for identity: it is part of our refusal of the self-destructiveness of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>male-dominated society.” (p. 35,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In Norma’s revelation I saw spread out before me my own belief
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>that we need to know our past if ever we are to break its hold on
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>us. Norma had travelled, like Marcia, from a place of total silence
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>through the intellectual recognition of her childhood abuse, to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>verbal acknowledgement and even mourning of her humilia
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>tion. But I believe it was writing out the entire event, coupled
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>with speaking it out loud to a small group, that brought her to a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>total re-evaluation of the incident and to her insight that it had
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>had power to cripple her life up till now.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Like Marcia, Norma experienced a tremendous new surge of
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>creative energy which culminated in her finishing the book she
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>had been trying to write for ten years: Dead Flowers in a Dill
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Pickle Jar. She no longer resorted to the “dumb prisoner” mask
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>that she had cultivated as a coverup in prison. This work, along
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>with other written explorations of her ethnic heritage, became a
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>powerful stage of creative development for Norma. Since then
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>her work has been published and she has won awards. Norma’s
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>willingness to explore her past inspired many of the other women
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>to write poems about Norma, as well as to risk that same
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>self-exploration.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Sandy, like Norma, had carried the disease of blame, guilt
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and self-hatred around with her from the age of nine. She wrote
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of her abuse:
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>So repulsive was this I knew it had to be what I deserved since Mom
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ma said I was the cause of the craziness at home. Her drinking, and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Dad and her fighting. ... Because of the craziness at home we finally
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>moved to another area, leaving the old man and the “jackal” (her
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>girlfriend’s father who also had abused her sexually), to bury them-
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>selves somewhere inside me.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Sandy and I spent several afternoons discussing how this very
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>early sexual abuse had left a mark that said she was a “bad girl,
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the “bad seed.” After all, she believed, she was the cause of her
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>parents’ problems and had been told so. Was it any wonder then
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that she thought she deserved this abuse? Another inmate and
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>former prostitute had once told me, “T associated abuse with love.
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Was it any wonder then that Sandy allowed her boyfriend-pimp
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to beat her? Or that her drug abuse was a direct outcome of the
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>trauma of molestation and sexual abuse by two older men?
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>She later wrote:
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>I have been the object of abuse much of my life, so much that I cover it
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>with my life as sometimes my will wilts like an uprooted flower. Has
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>abuse become so familiar to me and my existence that I continue to
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>abuse myself? Is it a cycle I will forever give life to, the addiction that
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>takes so much life from me:
				<lb facs='#facs_67_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Sandy died of a heart-lung disease nine months later. I wrote this

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of expressing her feelings and most especially her rage that had
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>led to the use of heroin to deaden all her feelings.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Sandy, like Norma, had had “no loving arms” to cry into at
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ten. The fact that at 24 she couldn’t cry was an example of how
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>she exerted strict control over all her emotions. She was her own
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>best warden, always fearful that the wrong emotion might get
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>out. She was surprised that I could read her emotional life so well
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>when I told her she looked like a Pacific Blowfish because her
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>whole body seemed to puff up when she tried to hold in her anger
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>(which she usually tried to do). She desperately wanted to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>“good girl.” She wanted to be a “lady.” She thought that the way
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>to do this was to suppress all her emotions and feelings. Heroin
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>helped her: it temporarily quieted the killing pain.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>As I got to know the women better and heard more of their
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>stories, I concluded that heroin addiction is most often the result
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>of the repressed rage from early child abuse. Men express their
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>rage and self-hatred outwardly against others. Women are trained
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>to express it at themselves. Says Elaine Carmen in her study of
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>men and women who have been victimized as adolescents:
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Males became more violent and abusive to others whereas female
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>victims became more self-destructive. Childhood trauma—whether
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>physical or social—was associated with the most mutilating and self
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>destructive acts. Rather than believe they have crazy parents, abused
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>children believe they deserve abuse, so they attempt to master the expe
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>rience with self-punishment.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I saw this self-punishment clearly manifested when, as I was walk-
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ing the women back to their dorms (after a workshop), Mary
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Ellen burst into tears and told me, “I feel like killing myself. I
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>think l’m going crazy. I keep imagining myself in Patton State
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Hospital. Every time I think of my stepmother coming to see me,

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>there’s no reason to think this, l’m afraid of everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>I was shocked but also relieved to see Mary Ellen finally cry
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>because all day long I had been trying to get her to open up. She

				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>sat during the afternoon workshop uninvolved, fidgety and dis
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tracted. One of the other women said that Mary Ellen should use
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the word “anger” to write from in her exercise that evening.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Mary Ellen did indeed write from “anger,” and the next day
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>she followed my advice and wrote out a dialogue between the
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>negative and positive voices she was hearing. But she couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>believe the positive voices. She could only listen to all the negative
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>voices—the negative voices from her past, from when she was a
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>little girl. These were the voices that said she was “fat,” a “slow
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>learner,” a “slut,” “lazy,” and that “she had killed her mother.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>She had such a powerfully negative self-image that she couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>hear anything positive about herself and was winding herself down
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>deeper and deeper into a depression. I knew Mary Ellen had been
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>beaten as a child. Her father was an alcoholic and she spoke often
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>of his abuse. At the same time he was her father and she dearly
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>wanted his love. She found it very difficult to blame him for his
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>abuse of her. Instead she turned her anger, guilt, blame inwards
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>towards herself. She thought that because she had stolen her moth-
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>er’s silver dollars and given them all away in an attempt to gain
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>friends at the age of seven, that she was inherently a “bad girl.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Even though she knew consciously that she hadn’t caused hei
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>mother’s death, she believed that she contained some evil power
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>inside herself that was the reason for her mother’s death as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the death of others.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Mary Ellen’s self-hatred was so great that she had attempted
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>suicide seven times before she entered prison. She was now 32.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>She used drugs, especially heroin, to deaden all these voices inside.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Because of my years of weekly contact and work with hun
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>dreds of women inmates who told or wrote about their lives, I am
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>absolutely convinced that child abuse—physical, sexual, emo
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tional, or through neglect—sets the stage for later self-destructive
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>acts. The rage smouldering from this early abuse finds its outlet
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>in drug addiction, alcoholism, excessive gambling, mental illness,
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>suicide, prostitution, and crime.
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The taboo against speaking about child abuse, especially sex
				<lb facs='#facs_68_r_5_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ual abuse, has been so great that the victims have lost their own

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>I came to understand very clearly my role in this prison, to see
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the great need to discover this lost, forgotten or hidden voice
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>The gift of creative writing became the tool for this exploration
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and communication. We learned to talk to each other in writing/to

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>it before I can speak it.

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and sorrow after so many years was critical for any growth or
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>change. The women needed to mourn for themselves and to have
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>a compassionate listener. They needed rituals for imaginative con-
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>frontations with their fear of speaking out or a workshop setting
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>which allowed them to release their own voice, thereby releasing
				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the voices of others. The whole atmosphere of repression was

				<lb facs='#facs_69_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>through the creation of a work of art in the form of prose, poetry,

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>field of artificial intelligence as unique.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>For one thing, the very idea of integrating
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>moving video imagery with educational
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>programs is very unusual, since most such

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that Beaumont proposes between user and
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>computer is in many respects untried
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>—the field is, after all, fairly new. But
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>perhaps more basic would be AMP’s pion
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>eering use of what is known in the artificial
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>intelligence community as a “study envi

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>computer’s responses to the user’s queries
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>and decisions reflect the computer’s infer-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ences, based in this case on the user’s
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>choices to that point and on the profile it
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>has formed from the biographical infor

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>program, of what the user wants to know
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>next. Thus it is very unlikely that any two
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>excursions through AMP would elicit the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>same sequence of information, or that they
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>would produce the same cognitive maps.
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Oddly, this inferential capacity gives the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>computer the privilege of ingenuity: what

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Beaumont’s paired intentions for this proj-
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>ect: encouraging viewer sensitivity to the
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>complexities of knowledge brought to bear
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>on creative decisions, and allowing users

				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>for AMP would indeed allow for a more
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>flexible use of computer-stored data than
				<lb facs='#facs_72_r_6_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>is now ordinarily possible, but some of the

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>qualify as “creative,” she says, they do not
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>result in artworks, since that function is
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>reserved for practicing artists and hinges

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>determined by Beaumont’s own imagina

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was launched in the name of Modernity,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>an ideal that, since the time of Descartes,

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>the London show’s underlying premise to

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>In this framework, Beaumont’s vision is
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>essentially a modern one. Her work seeks
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to redress what she sees as our society’s
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>“dispersed” belief in the individual. AMF

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ACD’s vice president and chair of the multi-cultural diversity
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>committee) said of her first ACD conference in Atlanta in 1983,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>“It was the first time I saw artists, administrators, and commu

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>gether. That was very exciting to me. I felt as though I had come
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>home.” Our annual conferences have continued to be a home for
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>many of us who have either felt that the doors were shut on us in
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>other organizations in which we worked or that our politics were
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>unwelcomed by arts councils, administrators, and the various art
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>disciplines and circles in which we found ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Connected with ACD’s broad definition of cultural workers
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>is its recognition that culture and cultural democracy require defi

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>movement for cultural rights and cultural democracy, they will
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>speak out on a great many questions of broad social concern:

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>will our schools teach and who will control them? Whose stories
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>will our cultural institutions preserve to make up the record we
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>leave for future generations? Will profit take precedence over peo-
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ple in the development of our cities, the design of our homes and
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>streets?
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>We must also remember that those members of our communi-
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ties who don’t consider themselves to be artists have been in
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>volved in an arts-related project at some point in their lives and
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>certainly have engaged in a creative process. The separation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>arts and sciences and creativity from the work process itself is a
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>recent phenomenon. We must recognize that we are all partici

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of different communities at once: at work, at home, in our neigh

				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>To empower ourselves and combat our oppression, rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>retrench, we must engage in the active process of re-membering
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ourselves, a process that many community artists use with their
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>fellow workers. It is a process of storytelling, sharing, oral his
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>tory, a re-discovery of cultural heritage buried under the weight
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of dominant commerical culture, and a re-examination of one’s
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>role in larger social and historical movements. As community art-
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ists we must remember that many of us have skills that extend
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>beyond our artistic ones, that we have been employed (whether
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>out of necessity or choice) in a variety of occupations, and that we
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>have played active roles in local, national, and international politi-
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>cal struggles.
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Once we as artists have identified our allies in other cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and political organizations, it will become crucial to make links
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>with them, so that we can make use of their skills as lawyers,
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>administrators, community and political organizers, etc., and so
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>that they can make use of our skills as artists. The act of inviting
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>“non-artists” into our alliance, and the offering of our skills
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and vision to them in turn, will bring us closer to another goal
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>of our work as politically concerned artists: the integration of
				<lb facs='#facs_75_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the arts and culture into the movement for social change. If we

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>foundation that members of the community become the artists
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and active participants in a creative project guided by the experi-

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cook. He was in the kitchen adding sugar
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to everything because Herbie, the boss,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was so cheap, he didn’t want Joe putting
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>eggs in the meatloaf or using spices. Fi-
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>nally Joe just gave up on flavor and added
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sugar instead.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>“No thanks.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Herbie’s customers were living proof
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that you are where you eat. The breakfast
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>club wasn’t too fascinating except for the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>couple having an affair. They snuck in a
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>few minutes together before work every
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>day, the guy coming first, staring ner
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>vously at his coffee. Then the lady came.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Her hair was done up like Loretta Lynn’s
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and she always ordered American cheese
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>on a toasted english and a glass of water
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>with a straw. They’d hold hands across the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>table and say things like,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>“Did you see Mel Torme on Night Court
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>last night?” Then she’d get in on his side
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of the booth and l’d leave them alone until
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>seven thirty when she went off to work at
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>the phone company across the street.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Every day was the same day. It started
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>with breakfast, which is always simple.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Most people want two over easy, whiskey
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>down, or else scrambled two all the way.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>You always have to ask them what kind of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>toast. Then they leave you a quarter be-
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>cause they think breakfast doesn’t merit
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the same tipping scale as other meals. l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>like to remind them that a token still costs
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>a dollar no matter what time you get on
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_8_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the train.

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Herbie’s mother came in at eleven carry
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ing shopping bags full of discount paper
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>towels or honey cake left over from her
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>daughter-in-law’s party. Herbie could sell
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>it for a dollar a slice. Joe called her Greased
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Lightning because she moved slowly but
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>still managed to steal waitresses’ tips right
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>off the tables. If you caught her in the act.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>she might give it back, but Momma was
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>one of those bosses who hated to see the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>employees eat because she saw her money
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>going into their mouths. She hated to pay
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>them or see them get tips because some
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>how that money should have been hers.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Her son was the same way, cheap. Herbie
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>claimed spring started March Ist. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>when he turned off the heat, which drove
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a lot of customers over to the Texas-style
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>chili parlor next door.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The lunch rush was a blur when I moved
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>so fast l’d forget I was alive and would
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>dream instead, swinging my hips back and
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>forth around the tables. That was actually
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>fun sometimes because of the challenge
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and the whole crew teaming up together,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>feeling closer. So it was always a letdown
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>when it ended at two o’clock because that
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>was it, money-wise, and the rest of the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>afternoon was going to be a sit-around
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>bore.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>By three o’clock the workers got to eat,
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>which meant sneaking around whenever
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Momma or Herbie would turn the othei
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>way and popping something in your mouth.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Technically we could have egg salad or
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>french fries, but Joe would pretend he was
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>slicing corned beef for a reuben and leave
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>a whole bunch on the slicer for us to grab.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Then Dino would forget to put away the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>fresh fruit salad so we could all have a nice
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>dessert. Only Rambo wouldn’t play along.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>He always threatened to turn us in, but
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>was too much of a coward. Rambo spent
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>the entire day leaning against the register
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>showing off his tattoos or talking about the
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>latest issue of Soldier of Fortune magazine
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>and how he wished he could have gone
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>over to Lebanon or Grenada instead of
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>being stuck back there in the reserves.
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>Work was so much the same every day
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and business was so slow that I had noth
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ing to do but read newspapers and, after
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>that, stare out the window. That’s when I
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>would think about sad things. I couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>help it. So, I started drinking with Joe
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>behind the grill. I guess I just needed to
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>sleep for a couple of weeks but I had to go
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>to work instead, so drinking was some
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_9_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>kind of compromise between the two. I

			<pb n='81'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>knew enough, though, to keep in control
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of things or else the customers looked at
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>you funny, which makes you feel paranoid
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and pathetic.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>In the old days, I would come home
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>from the restaurant and Delores would be
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>there.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>“Hi baby, I missed you so much,” she’d
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>l’d put my nose in her neck and say,
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>“Mmm, you smell great.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>“You don’t.” She’d laugh, that strange
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Delores way of mocking and loving at the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>same time. “You smell like eggs and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>grease.” She’d kiss me on the face and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>slap my ass, being silly and cute.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Even after I took a shower, I never
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>smelled as good as she did. I had to settle
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>for being a nicer person and what the hell
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>does that mean?
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>I don’t like to admit it but women are
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the worst tippers. They put their heads
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>together to divide up the bill and actually
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>figure out exactly fifteen percent without
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>taking into consideration how much they
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>made you run around. Men don’t talk
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>about it. Each one peels a dollar from his
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>billfold and quietly leaves it by the side of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>his plate.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>It was a tough day at Herbie’s because
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Momma was ragging on all of us. Joe and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>I were drinking rum, trying to stay out of
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>her way. Some cooks make you feel tired,
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>others are plain annoying, but somehow
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Joe charmed me into being more feline
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>With gold chains shining on his brown
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>skin, and a toothpick hanging from his
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>lips, every favor he asked was a service.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and his smile, approval. The way he’d say
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>got it babe when I called in my order, no
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>matter how busy he was, always reminded
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>me that he was my pal.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>“Rum is good,” he said in his Caribbean
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>accent, “but it can betray you. When you
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>get the shakes, you’ve gone too far. Don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>go that far, you’re still a lovely girl. You’re
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>a sweetheart.”
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Then he looked both ways and poured
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>some more into my coffee cup.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>“But,” he sighed, “what can you do?
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>The world is so full of pain.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>Then he’d scratch his big stomach and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>laugh.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>“l’m going home to Brooklyn and smoke
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>some cocaine and turn on the television.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Oh, I am getting fat from all the sugar in

				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>When Joe left, I hung out with Dino

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>who was on the grill until closing. He was
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>telling his war stories again because there
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was nothing at all happening on the floor.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>“I was all over the Pacific during the
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>war,” he said. “They sent me to islands!
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>didn’t even know the names of till I was on
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>’em. Then we got two weeks of R and R in
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Hawaii. That was nice. Hotel, everything.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>“Did they have segregated regiments
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>then, Dino?
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>“Yep. And drill sergeants of both colors
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>All of them ugly as homemade soap.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Oh-oh, check out Rambo. Thinks he’s so
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sly, that jerk.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Rambo was busy being the big man and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>giving away food for free to a cute Puerto
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Rican clerk from the hardware store. She
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was playing real coy and hard to get. But
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Rambo had picked the wrong moment to
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>get off the register because the place was
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>too empty and Momma was keeping her
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>eye on everything. That’s when I realized
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>that for all his tough-assed talk, Rambo
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>didn’t even know how to steal and get
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>away with it. He was putting on his whole
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>show right out in the open, wildly flagrant
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>without choosing to be.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>“That turkey is so overt,” Dino said.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Rambo ran rampant all over the kitchen.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>He whipped up a plate of the rarest roast
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>beef while Dino sat there chuckling and
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>covering his eyes. The slices were so rec
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and bloody that Momma could spot them
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>from a block away.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>“Thief!” she shrieked, and her shrillness
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>made the orange wallpaper tremble.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>“What’s the matter, bitch?” he said under
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>his breath.
				<lb facs='#facs_81_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>“Do you have a ticket for that? Where is

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Initially this mural was a small community
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>based project inspired and nurtured by
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>my neighbor Aida T. It was sponsored by
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the block association and funded by the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>local merchants. The mural project became
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>a symbol for the neighborhood, a site of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cooperation and contention. The mural
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>took its voice and vision directly from the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>community. Had I known the final impact
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of my vociferous mural I would never
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>have begun all this.

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>of the poor, ethnically diverse neighbor-

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>fragments of each genre as I began to
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>delve into the conceptual underpinnings
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>of modern art.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>changing function of walls. Of course, at first
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it was only interior walls that became murals.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>pictures not detachable from people, people
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>not detachable from spaces. Now it&apos;s been
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>turned inside out: no longer do walls shelter
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>and enclose; walls break up, break down,
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>break out and get broken into. Not a clean
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>break, in half, dividing us from them, like the
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Great Wall of China, dividing inside from
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>outside like the Berlin Wall, not just this one
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>division. But walls within walls within walls.
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Walls with no more space inside them. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>these tenement buildings,—people locked
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>out and locked in and, at the same time, in
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>constant motion, escaping walls, abandoning
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>themselves. But some people have figured out
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>how to keep moving in place, travelling
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>through walls, inside themselves.

				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was easily appropriated as a source of
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>form, texture and raw materials. Beyond
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>this, was my imagination best fired by use
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>of a camera, a brush, a press or a hammer?
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>It was food for thought, it was a problem I
				<lb facs='#facs_86_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>could only resolve by withdrawal. Taken to
